hi  can someone tell me how the restrictions will be in april 2021  also need help with daily budget  thanks , syou can delete this  if this is isn t supposed to be here lately  this has be really something nerve wrecking  people seem to assume this sub can predict the future it became quite uncanny to scroll through new posts  basically only consisting of oracle like questions and impossible help seeking i think it has affected this sub  i see less engaging overall and some of the better posts just disappear in the sheer amount of above said posts furthermore  it is understandable to need help with budgetting or asking what it s like somewhere else  i mean  i guess that s what the sub is for funnily enough  it seemed to be reallyon to avoid some info gathering before  google ing and maybe even select a few countries to be more specific a world trip to maybe 6 different nations on 15 continents in octember 2026 making a stop at the moon station via musk tours seems more specific  that some of the questions this sub is getting what are your thoughts about this ,0
is it expensive traveling with a flexible itinerary ,i m planning my first solo trip  hopefully  and optimistically sometime this summer  and i want this trip to be as open ended and flexible as possible   i ve really taken to the concept of traveling with no concrete dates  in sort of a nomadic fashion  just staying in a city or country until i get bored and deciding a week or less out where i want to go next and when   i ve seen many posts here and follow many travel vlogers who travel like this and i ve been inspired however  it seems to me that this style of travel would be much more expensive  particularly when booking flights on such short notice   am i wrong   is there a good strategy to save money on flights when traveling in this style to add more specifics  i m planning on traveling to turkey  and then from there  i would like to continue on to at least one or two more countries nearby in the middle east or the mediterranean edit  added more specifics ,0

weak passport holders  how do you travel spontaneously ,so i plan to travel once it is safe to travel  my idea initially was to take a break from my job and travel for 3 months backpacking across europe  but seems like that plan will take a while due to the pandemic  my question is  how do people with weak passports plan their trips in respect to visa  i am from india so my passport isn t the best  i love on the spot plans and just hate booking  hotels in advance as sometimes i want to stay longer and sometimes i want to move fast  but due to visa issues i have to book everything in advance which sucks  how do you guys manage  dummy booking  if this europe plan doesn t work out  i am thinking of backpacking in asia  any suggestions  i have been to thailand  bali and malaysia already   wouldn t mind repeating thou    again i don t know how to plan a flexible travel as most of the countries in asia too require me to book flights or hotels in advance  any tips ,0
central america  where is the turf to surf ,hello all i have been brainstorming travel ideas as life begins to slowly crawl towards normalcy again  and have been dying to go on a trip  i have just received my first dose of the pfizer vaccine  am an hcw  and am receiving my next dose in two weeks if it is worth mentioning  if possible  i d like to plan this trip for early to mid may  my budget is ideally under  1500 for two weeks in a country in central america  i also have  150 cashback bonus on my credit card that i plan on putting toward the cost of the flight  i am kind of a history geek as well  but am also interested in somewhere rich in hiking spots  with other activities available  allowing social distancing of course  i imagine costs for the flight will amount to no more than  350 out of the total 1500  i have found several beachside airbnbs in nicaragua around  25 per night as for activities  the main thing on my list is finding the best beaches to surf on  i m open to hiking  fishing  camping  swimming and the like  i live in the deep midwest  and have been a wage slave at my place of work since covid   am needing to get away from that place for a bit  the language barrier doesn t mean much  i have a decent amount of traveling experience and know enough spanish to get by  in what country can i get the most out of my money does 1500 seem like enough for a trip such as this  as the vaccines be distributed  will countries begin to adjust their policy regarding international travelers  i have been considering nicaragua and costa rica the most  i ve consulted some friends who have traveled central america and i was told that nicaragua is too dangerous and costa rica is too expensive  what do y all think sorry for the scatterbrained format  i typed this up in a hurry ,0

5 things that have made solo travel more enjoyable to me after 30  countries   looking for other viewpoints from travellers,1 a phone with battery to last 2 days and maps me offline maps application  during my early solo travels  getting lost was always something that i was afraid of  maybe i was hesitant on exploring a neighbourhood because i suspected i wouldn t find my way back  maybe i was hesitant to follow a road because it could turn out to be a waste of time  no more of that after i discovered that offline maps can minimise all these issues  you always know where you are and even if you get lost  you can easily find your way back  this made me feel much freer and more increased my eagerness to explore different places in a city 2 a good selection of ebooks pre selected before the trip  any trip has downtime  maybe a long queue  recovering from a heavy meal at a restaurant or just these few hours at the end of the day to relax  i find that it s good for the mind to keep busy reading something during those hours  it could be a book related to the place of visit or about the history of the country  it could also be somethingpletely unrelated like a victorian novel or a non fiction book about a subject of your interest  it doesn t matter as long as itpels you to read and keeps your mind busy 3 packing light and a good backpack  when i first arrive in a new location  i don t want to feel the stress of having to find my aodation right away because of heavy luggage concerns  for that reason i pack as light as possible with the assumption i must be able to carry the weight throughout the days on my back at all times  it makes my travels a lot more free spirited  i can wander around the city all day and only go to the hostel hotel late at night and then leave again early in the morning to maximise sightseeing time 4 leaving flexibility in my plans and being okay with missing must see places if they don t personally interest me  this has greatly freed up my travelling days  my previous approach included listing down let s say 5 places that the guidebook rended and then visiting them  this left me feeling like i am doing hard work and sometimes the places themselves felt overrated or not worth seeing  my new approach to mitigate this is to just decide for myself what i want to see   lonely planet says a museum on local religious art is number one attraction   great  but i don t care much for religious art so i will rather spend my 2 hours walking around a neighbourhood and taking photos and trying out local food 5 advanced only  going in blind without doing any research and not booking any aodation ahead of time  after being to 30  countries  travel can start to feel routine  you go to city x  sightsee  sleep at hotel x  then go to city y  sightsee  sleep at hotel y  it s all a bit predictable  i wanted to feel a sense of chaos and adventure  so i tried out this philosophy on a recent trip to morocco  i did very little research  the only aodation i booked was the first night after landing  then when in morocco  if i felt like staying an extra day  i could do so  if transport options to go to place x were not available  i simply went to place y  it made the entire trip much more relaxed and spontaneous  there were also more moments of surprise as i had done little research so it felt like exploring the unknown sometimes  the only thing to note here is that this approach can only be done in countries with lower tourist demand  such as south morocco in early december  as otherwise the price penalty from not booking ahead would be significant ,0
now that travel is fairly restricted who do you watch to life your travel dreams through ,i ve travelled from new zealand to france in the past two weeks  amp  was curious who you guys watch currently on youtube to live your travel dreams through  most youtubers who focus on travel seem to be posting infrequently for obvious reasons so i really need someone to watch besides bald  amp  bankrupt,0

post brexit uk multiple entry eu visa rules ,pre brexit and the free movement of people we were fine to visit any eu nation ande and go as we pleased  however post brexit is anybody aware of what the new rules are  i m planning a trip to vienna as and when the opportunity to travel again arises  and after spending a few days in vienna  i was planning on using it as a hub to catch trains to surrounding countries capital cities i e  bratislava and either prague or budapest for day trips  would this still be possible under the new regulations ,0
splurging when travelling on a shoestring budget,how often do you splurge how much do you spend  what do  you spend it on  i have a month long trip planned and my  splurges  will be 3 separate days of car rental  at around  20 usd per day  in three different destinations just to explore the surrounding areas  public transport is available  but not the more flexible and i like the freedom to explore other off the beat places through driving ,0
making an informed decision about travel at this time,travel and tourism are contentious topics right now  for good reason  i see a lot of people on the fence about their planned travels  i m not trying to shame you  but i d like you to make as informed and honest a decision as possible  so i d like to run through someon talking points i see about travel at this moment tourism reliant places desperately need my money this is an unfortunate reality  but it s worth asking yourself one thing  is this really why you re going on a vacation  if it were your largest motivator  why would a donation not suffice  my favorite clubs are suffering right now too  and yet  it would not make sense for me to go clubbing  nor would it be a charitable act i am following all the rules i think we all agree that just because you can doesn t really mean you should  in many parts of the us  local regulations say you re able to go around without a mask  we know unequivocally that this is wrong  despite it being allowed within the rules it puts everyone around you in harm s way i m taking all the necessary safety precautions for one  as we all know  a negative result is not a guarantee that you are covid free  this puts your flight attendants  pilots  airport airline staff  taxi drivers  hospitality staff all at needless risk two  the biggest safety precaution that our public health experts have advocated has been  stay home  you cannot be abiding by all the rended safety precautions given that you ve violated the biggest one i will be fine even if i get sick i m trying to foster an honest discussion  so honestly  chances are  yes  people on reddit tend to be younger and you ll likely make it out ok  but as people who love to travel  i have to imagine part of the reason why is because you genuinely love the different people and cultures of the world show yourpassion and love for these people now with your patience  they are excited for you toe back as much as you are to see them  but there is a time and place  and while it is not now  it wille soon i know this has been a tremendously difficult experience  but normalcy is so close  a vaccine is within grasp and you will have it soon  better yet  a vaccine will make your travel experiences exponentially better  and of course  the people and places you love around the world will be much safer too i know people can t stay inside their home indefinitely  you need to leave the house once in a while  if just for your sanity  try local day trips that have minimal exposure to others  i ve hiked this year more than i ever have in my life and at risk of sounding privileged  consider what a gift time can be  i have never had so much free time in my life before  i ve started reading again  i ve started playing my cello again after a decade away  i m taking courses in statistics  for my career  and spanish  for my future travels  my diet and exercise have never been better  while these luxuries are not something everyone obviously has access to  i imagine if you are considering travel vacations right now these might be accessible to you too ultimately  i m a stranger on the internet and the decision is yours alone  but i think it s important to be honest with oneself about your motivations before making a decision  i hope i ve helped in some way to inform an honest assessment when you make your choice ,0
when to travel and how to afford it ,so i am a teenager who has been fortunate enough to be on my own solotrip once   and i loved it  i am taking a gap year in two years and recently started saving to afford my plans and started planning it in more detail  but this made me wonder  how old were you guys when you started to travel and does it stop at a certain age  i am just afraid i wouldn t get to experience many countries on my gap year except at the expense of experiencing countries in depth  and if i dont experience many countries on my gap year  i am afraid i will never visit them in my life  is this assumption some what true  on the economic aspect  how do you afford travelling so much to so many countries and how do you budget for them thanks in advance for your help ,0
ukraine   kiev  liev and odessa,hey guys   im planning exploring ukraine in the uing summer  i only stay at hostels but other than that i use quite some money on drinking  mostly beers  no fancy drinks  am eating out once or twice a day and gonna explore museums and chernobyl for a day tour  would 100 dollars per day be enough for that  i should probably say that it s for 3 weeks so my budget is around 2k usd,0
use up all my hotel points and still meet people for my birthday trip to central europe ,i ve done plenty of solo traveling in the past  stayed at hostels  hotels  airbnb s  flown first class and taken obscure local trains  i also have really been into gathering hotel and airline points from credit cards the last 5 years  and using them mostly to fly better airline classes when the flight is over 8 hours long  i ve only occasionally used hotel points  preferring to do bnbs and hostels when traveling solo to save money and meet people more but my 30th birthday ising up this summer  so i booked a trip to central europe  budapest  vienna  and prague  and i want to treat myself for this one  i have tons of points i could use for swanky hotels in these cities  but i feel i would miss out on meeting people  and end up feeling very alone during the trip  on the other hand  if i have the hotel points why not use them before they get devalued into oblivion and save the money for other stuff  are there ways for me to meet people outside of hostels and guesthouses  or could i drop into a nearby hostel anyway to meet people that way  i m torn  i ve checked out a few apps and they look pretty dodgy and not reliable enough to meet people through ,0
what do i do about this messy situation ,hey there so i m sure i ll get shit on more than anything for this because of covid so i ll preface that i  am vaccinated  will wear a mask and face shield and use hand sanitizer 1 000 times  will be getting tested multiple times  and will not be  doing tourist shit  or interacting with the locals and will quarantine when i get there and when i get back so my question is i have a flight scheduled for january 23rd from newark to morocco  actually it s alaska to newark to morocco but they are two separate bookings  my flights from ny gt ma and back were wicked cheap  about half the price of the next cheapest flight which should have been my first red flag  i booked with tap portugal and didn t really think anything of it well  i mention my flight to someone on facebook and they say  oh no  tap is horrible  they had apparently canceled her flights  three times  and refuse to issue a refund  like basically it s a known scam airline that sells crazy cheap flights and then cancels 90  of them last minute  never issuing any refunds  i looked online and saw dozens and dozens and dozens of extremely angry reviews so i called tap portugal customer service and  the number doesn t work  like  the airline s number just doesn t work  i try several other numbers associated with the airline  none of them work  expedia  which i used to buy the ticket  basically washed their hands of it   we can t call them if you can t  kinda deal  plus the airline set the cancellation fee at  400 fucking dollars so i contact my bank to see if they can chargeback  they can t  because despite the ticket being purchased a week ago it still hasn t posted and they can t touch a charge until it s posted so i m wondering  does anyone have experience with international flights with tap portugal  should i just go with the hopes that the flight will actually run  and run the risk of having it canceled last minute and being stranded in nyc  buy another fucking ticket and eat the cost of the budget ticket  with the off chance possibility that they might refund me thank you ,0
travel plans for france   greater western eu trip  looking for suggestions to and tips to get me started as a first time traveller,i know this post is perhaps a bit more vague than the other ones here  but i don t have any precise plans for travel quite yet  just that i know after all this pandemic nonsense is said and done i  need  to get out of the country  i was specifically reserving 2020 for my  fuck it  i m going to travel the world  year  and my newpany gives me a month of vacation  so  might as well start planning now i know french and some german  and france has always been a destination i d love to tour  but i need suggestions for good cities and sites to visit because it has just been difficult to wade through all the tourist adevertisement laden stuff  i don t actually have that much interest in paris  but would love to see and tour some of the lesser known chateaus and countryside towns  if you guys know of any particularly pretty hidden gems  if i have the time and money  i might do a bit of backpacking touring more of france and western europe in general  specifically i d love to visit berlin and lisbon  i also have friends from my time volunteering scattered around europe  london  rome  geneva  solo  so  if there are generally any  must sees  or  if you re going to visit x region  here s everything i would look into  that d be awesome again  i know this is kinda vague and a lot  but as a first timer i m not looking for an encyclopedia or everything to be spoon fed  just some  hey  if you like x  these regions have nice stuff  because trying to get the big picture stuff sifted from all the tourism laden websites is  difficult  and i d like rendations from other travelers  ,0
will covid 19 or the issue of  over tourism  make you to rethink your plans ,before covid hit there were countless articles about over tourism  too many tourists  in places like paris  rome  prague  barcelona  venice  etc  then covid 19 hit and they went deserted  have any of you changed your plans  or thought about changing your plans  to avoid contributing to the  problem in the future or maybe avoid crowds where you could more easily get an air borne disease as crowds are returning  does anyone live in a city region that gets too many tourists my own city sofia was bing way too touristy in 2019 and many here haveplained of it losing its authenticity  i quote a friend  hearing foreign speech is cool during the first 100 times  after that it makes you feel like the place has been infiltrated and hijacked   must be a subconscious thing from prehistoric tribalism lol  most places where people have been friendly to me are either those where there aren t that many tourists foreigners  genuine curiosity and interest  or those that literally rely on tourist money to survive  not very genuine  locals in cities that are big enough to survive even without foreign tourism are usually less aodating weing and couldn t care less  anyone notice this pattern the pandemic showed that tourism is a very volatile sector and societies who rely only on it need to diversify  as for me  i ve decided to travel to less popular parts of countries  southeastern eastern poland  eastern hungary  puglia in italy  and only stick to a few popular touristy places where i really love the place  amp  local culture  but visit them less often  madeira  krakow  stockholm  etc  and you edit  2nd and 3rd tier places in europe worth checking imo  bamberg  erfurt  eisenach wartburg  visby gotland  przemysl  tarnow  morskie oko  debrecen  balaton lake  ruse  sliven  yambol  stara zagora  bari and lecce ,0
for my women solo travelers  what are some feminine hygiene rules  amp  tips other women should know ,ive been reading about the differences of feminine hygiene products in other countries  in the usa there are applicator tampons and a lot of options  but in countries like germany they don t use applicator tampons  amp  south korea they have more expensive  amp  limited amount of deodorant because they don t smell bo wise  im korean and that s mostly true  still use deodorant antiperspirant though  i also have another question if you made it up to here  are there ultra sized tampons in your country  during my period i use a menstrual cup for sleep  they last 12 hours   amp  ultra sized tampons for the day  the only size that doesn t require a pad underneath  amp  prevents leakage  i literally would not survive without them ultra sized tampons  so lmk if they re available in your country ,0
is there a list of hostels that have permanently closed this year ,i ve seen a little discussion about this on solotravel but not as much as i expected to  i m curious about which hostels have closed permanently due to this year s lack of travel  and how many have closed in general  i know there are a few threads about certain hostels that have closed  but i m wondering if it would be possible to make a mega list of hostels that have closed permanently so that people who have spent time there have a place online to pour one out for the places that meant something to them  or to just know that a place they used to love  or hate  has closed up shop these are the ones i know of off the top of my head that have closed permanently  i can keep the list updated if the mods are cool with it  retox  budapest  hi hostel  austin  tx  usa amp x200b i think the aspect of solo travel i miss the most is staying at the kind of hostel that feels more like home than your actual home   the kind of place that you get stuck at for way too long because you can t bear to check out  i ve been donating a bit on  adoptahostel  but i know that there are a lot of beloved hostels that aren t on there  and i m not sure how much it helps in the face of such huge hostel ie losses  anyways  let me know if anyone has other confirmations about places that have closed permanently  i ll add them to the list above ,0
difference in behavior traveling solo vs a group,since i haven t been able to travel much i was thinking about past trips  looking through old photos  etc   i noticed that the trips where i traveled  solo i actpletely different   my experiences ended up beingpletely different even in places that were the same  it was consistent during domestic  us  and overseas trips  in groups i m shy  i never meet any locals  i only spend time with friends  i don t do much site seeing   it s generally just my girls and i hanging out in a different location   i don t feel like i get much of a  trip  out of it but ie back fresh and relaxed abd still look back on those trips as fulfilling   solo i m almost extroverted  i meet a ton of locals  go site seeing  do excursions  stay in dumpy hostels airbnb s  turn on a tinder account that just says  here on vacation  go out more   i generally look back on these trips as fulfilling as well and definitely more of an adventure  however ie back exhausted and almost needing a couple days to just chill   both are great and i think i would want to continue both but it took a long break from travel to notice the differences ,0

sad that i won t be able to travel again, i have a feeling the covid 19 pandemic will last at least two years just like the spanish flu  1918 1920  i m guessing mid 2022  in january 2020  i booked a cheap roundtrip airline ticket from new york  new york to miami  florida for the end of march 2020  then covid 19 forced me to cancelled my ticket two days before departure  i was really looking forward to my trip  if i knew this was going to happen  i would ve never bought a ticket in the first place  i m kind of worried i won t be able to use my airline credit at all since the ticket was nonrefundable and it expires in december 2021  hopefully the airline will extend it  i would ve continued my trip to florida  but beaches and restaurants were closed at 5pm  city curfew at 10pm and disney world was closed indefinitely  so there was no point of me going with all those restrictions  i have this feeling that i have to wait five years to start traveling again meaning no mask  no social distancing and no quarantine  i m sick and tired of staying home all the time  not going anywhere at all while extremely bored  i rather be staring out of an airplane window  instead of my living room window looking at trees  this pandemic is making me waste my 20s away  the age range i m suppose to enjoy  i turned 24 two days ago  every time i look at the photos videos of my first solo trip in may 2019 at the age of 22  i start to smile  wishing i can go back to 2019  don t take life for granted as they say  i miss traveling so much  how s everybody doing in this pandemic  were you forced to cancel your trip  happy new year   2021,0
atlas obscura trips   any experience ,while travel still seems like a bit of a pipe dream at the moment  i m considering signing up for a group trip when it looks more realistic  i m considering the standards  contiki  topdeck  g adventures  but saw on an old reddit post that atlas obscura actually  hosts group travel has anyone ever been on one of these trips  i m intrigued by their offerings  especially the  space themed russia trip  which seems incredible  i m really interested in space travel disclaimer  based on other threads i ve read where people have asked about organised group travel  i m aware that these are expensive and it would be cheaper to organise myself  i m veryfortable organising my own trips  just keen to give some group travel a go later in the year and these seem like very unique trips ,0
anyone like traveling to places on the basis of  who else do you know has gone to x ,something was pointed out to me by my family over the holidays via zoom  my travel plans have shifted in the year before the pandemic to look for stuff that aren t  regular  destinations in earnest  i have visited my share of more  popular  destinations  paris  london etc  and certainly enjoy them  i am not a person who degrades anyone for their choice of travel  i have a great aunt who spoke with me about wanting to go to rome on her first international trip and said  but that s just too boring for you  and i reassured her that any place she wants to go is a good trip for her  i mention this because i was told that i have begun to look at places on the basis of the question  do you know anyone who has traveled to x  or  who else do you know has gone to x   i was told that i am doing this just to shock people and gain credibility with other travelers as well as one upping others  i had never thought of it like that  but i had mentioned that i would really like to see iran and saudi arabia  these are two places that have intrigued me since i was young  but as a solo woman traveler  i never thought i d get the chance  i have read more and more about them and it looks like they are potential options  but i have been told that i would only be doing it because it is uon though probably not on this sub i was thinking about it and i guess that is part of the appeal of some places  i d like to visit the faroe island and svalbard  i d love to do the trans siberian railway and beijing to lhasa one as well  these are all places that look cool but am i doing it just because it is lesson  my family and friends do not believe that these are places that are actually on anyone s bucket list  they intrigued me for what they are but i can t deny that there is a part of me that thinks  i will be going somewhere that no one i know would venture to  it feels adventurous  i was the first person in my family to visit japan my first solo trip  and everyone had a meltdown except my deceased father who accurately predicted that it would be the first of many journeys  and now  as much as i love japan  it feels a little pedestrian  i d love to go back  but to explore the more out of the way places sorry  this was long and rabmly  but i am just thrown off a bit  feeling like perhaps my motives for travel are wrong ,0
how do you decide to drive or fly ,i had some flight vouchers which were only good for travel within the us   i decided to book a flight to dc  rent a car and explore various battlefields from the civil war and revolution   now that i m shopping for rental cars  i realize i ve made a terrible mistake   the flight may be free  but the rental car   parking at my hometown airport will add up to almost  1000    i think i will end up cancelling the flight and driving down   if you are going alone  where do you draw the line on driving vs  flying ,0

in january to portugal  so i was ready for a trip  fortunately  i booked a cheap flight to palermo and spent 3 nights there to fuel the spark and getting into the zone  march to july  4months  slowly passed and now its time to travel finally made it to my hostel  bubble hostel  5 a night  after a budget friendly flight to the airport located 15k outside of the centre  when you first step foot outside any airport  the taxis are the first line of defence  but you got to ignore them and find a bus metro or a train  in krakow s case  a bus was the option  travelling solo allows you to listen to music so always have the freshest spotify playlist prepared you re your adventure arriving from the uk were bojo was doing his best impersonation of vicky pollard  picture daily mirror of this  you would expect the clubs and bar crawl to be closed  you are wrong  whilst i was in poland  i went on the same bar crawl 5 times  all nightclubs open until 5am and later  it seems to me that covid must go to sleep at midnight   forget the new normal because i am now back in the normal  1m floor signs and masks still to be worn in indoor spaces  gyms fully open and no need to book  this was a blessing as gyms only reopened later on in the uk and of course closed againduring my month in  eastern  europe you allocentrics may call it   to me its central europe  it seemed very calm and controlledpared to the state in the uk  it continued like this for the whole month the flight situation was the there was no blocking of seats  however on all three flights i experienced  there was the luxury of a row to myself  the bus situation is that there are no blocking of seats and it seemed normal  the only thing what was different is that you have to wear a masks in both areasheadphones in and listening to the varies songs and occasionally podcast   i ventured on the explore the main attractions of krakow  pictures  there are positives travelling in covid  as the sites be quieter and as a tourist  it is an opportunity to appreciate the sites  on the other hand  less people on the bar crawls  but the locals did not disappoint when visiting a new country  it is always best to learn a few words to impress the locals whenever you re in a bar and had too much to drink  i experienced many friendly people and never felt unsafe in poland as everyone i met was very weing  in my first hostel  i met a few german lads who i had a chat to about the city they were from and my limited knowledge on to bundesliga  travelling around  i feel like football is a universal language  especially being from manchester  as people smile when you just mention a few players from their country or team 3 days into krakow  i reluctantly switched hostels to  willa retro hostel  9 a night  as i enjoyed the free coffee tea and breakfast offered by the bubble hostel  in the new hostels garden was a very chilled vibe with music and socializing taking place aplete opposite to what lockdown offered in the months of april and may  at this point  my excitement levels jumped despite i had no plans on theing month a few days later  i agreed on an itinerary exploring the southern areas of poland  this include the cities of katowice   wroclaw   lodz   warsaw   lublin   zakopane  via krakow  spontaneously after a chat to a stranger at 4am in a krakow nightclub i decided to go to budapest but turns out i had to go before the 1st september as hungary were closing their borders  i did not know this prior purchasing the flixbus tickets from krakow   kosice  slovakia  then kosice   budapest sad to be leaving krakow i ventured on to katowice just for the night  i can t say much about this city but around this time there were protest against the current government on their views on gay rights so i spectated a fairly peaceful protest in the city centre   hostel sentral  9 a night  was seen as a bargain as i was one of two people in my dorm   anotheron themefew hours on the morning bus ride to wroclaw was relaxing as there was no people around me  this was a regular theme throughout my trip  travelling in covid was a dream for exploring  wroclaw was a lovely surprise due to it reminding me what krakow was like with the beautiful architecture  labelled as a university city  i did notice the student scene as the parks on the river were full of life with people drinking and just socializing  this was apletely different approach to the uk due to no more than 6 people meeting up  still amazed that the gyms still open and the evening atmosphere in the centre still alive  you wouldn t see a soul enjoying life in the major cities of the uk  i didn t stay much in  absynt hostel  6 a night  as there were many areas to check out   pictures of stadium  centre and park  it had that big city feel which i wernt expecting but i can see this city picking up a reputation and i would rend anyone to visiton to the lesser known cities of poland   lodz  another cheap and safe journey by flixbus and i was greeted by the presence of nothing  a massive bus station filled with nothing  i don t know if this is because of covid or the bus station is too big for the city the same greeting  i had from the bus station was the same greeting i had when i entered my dorm at the  cynamon hostel  8 a night  nothing  no one entered my room for the next 3 nights i was there  and i m convinced there was no one else in the entire hostel  an entire hostel for  24 pounds for 3 nights  royalty  lodz isn t too popular with tourist  but i m surprised to see no domestic tourists  it was the weekend  so it gave me an opportunity to check out the nightlife  over this weekend i watched the demolition bayern munich did to barcelona  watched on bein sport with some guys from the middle east  no english spoken it seems in these parts of poland and so just ordering a simple drink wasplicated  i laughed with the locals  whilst not understanding a word but the music was good warsaw  second time in warsaw for me after visiting with friends back in march 2019  one of my favourite buildings is located in this city  palace of cultural  amp  science  but apart from that eurgh  when travelling  i think when you travel to the capital  it does not represent the country  so travelling to the second cities to countries it gives a fairer review of a country  one of the many few positives warsaw holds is that there s an impressive beach where you can chill   city view lucka hostel  5 a night  not the best hostel but i was bound to encounter a negative hostel experience especially when hopping from hostel to hostel  moving on travelling again with flixbus to the next city on the eastern side of poland which is lublin  prior toing to this surprisingly close knit town  i didn t do any research as i wanted to be surprised  and i was  a standard old town filled with the coloured buildings and hosting an impressive castle casting over the town  i would rend this place and rend the hostel as well  folk hostel  8 a night  finally i weren t alone in a dorm  as i got talking to a few of the tourist  just by luck a hungarian girl was staying in the dorm as i ended up getting her contacts as i planned to visit budapest  also  a hostel first for me was that a dog was staying in the room  was a very cute dog and caused no problem aww  the main attraction in this town is the concentration camp located on the outskirts of the city  vast area with a handful of people in the grounds  highly rended if your interested in the history of the surroundings flixbus again of course back to where it all started  how much has krakow changed with covid restrictions since i was last there a few weeks ago  turns out  not much as i met up with the bar crawl lads and seshed to 6am with varies nationalities including france  netherlands and even the uk   as a solo traveller it is a great way to meet people and connect with as when you ve had a drink you would make friends with anybody  in and out of hostels it is always good to splash out  not too much  on an apartment for a few days to recharge the batteries  a dumb move by me was the book an apartment by the train station    jm rooms lubicz 10  15 a night    wonder why it was so cheap afternoon bus to the hidden beauty of zakopane  only 3 hours from krakow and i highly rend visiting if you ever get the opportunity  i expect it to be packed because of the many walking routes you can do in summer  in contrast to the skiing in winter  i really did get that austrian mountains vibe but with such cheap prices  one to visit again in the future  unreal views unreal   willa mavi  13 a night  topped it for me as i decide to stay in apartment with views of the mountains  bonus  it had a bathtub  when you visit the bordering regions of poland slovakia  you got to check out the  morskio oko  even in these covid times  get to the bus station early to beat the crowds because you would like the lake for yourself apletely different side of poland i thought id never encounter with the fresh air and amazing views  i returned to krakow feeling content knowing it was the weekend  so i had to go on a bar crawl on my last night of krakow  i sure did that and stayed out until 6  no 10pm pubs shutting here but hey ho  you people in the uk had 50  off food next day was off to a new place in a new country   kosice  slovakia  was a lengthy bus journey and no trouble crossing the border  i thought because of covid there would be trouble but no there was no problem whatsoever but could i leave slovakia and enter hungary  who knows lets risk it it s a shame for slovakia because it is positioned in between their well known neighbours of poland  amp  hungary  i personally not too interested in the country and yes i have been to the capital   bratislava last year  not solo my mind was just thinking about if i can enter hungary  but i would have to take a overnight train to ruzemberok then a bus down to budapest  thankfully  no issues on crossing the borders  the date was 31 08 2020 so one day just before the borders close  from the bus station to the hostel was just an easy metro ride to the centre  it really is not hard to direct your way around the major cities of europe just follow the maps on offer and use google maps  the metro to the centre was a quick ride and i was soon ready to check in but it was 7am  most hostels hostels accept check ins at 2pm so knowing this i booked the night before and with hope i could sleep the morning away in budapest  long story short that was not possible  after chatting to an italian girl about her city torino  who was working in the  hostel one basilica  5 a night  i explored the attractions such as the parliament building  chain bridge and many more   the busiest attraction would be the sz chenyi thermal bath  but we are in a global pandemic the nightlife in budapest did not disappoint despites it was covid  luckily my hostel was full of outgoing people who worked in the hostel and knew the best places to party  a tip for any student travelling is to research the citys erasmus page and check if there are any events  this is because the beer tends to be cheaper  i was successful in my search for an erasmus night  the entry was cheap  and the drinks were cheap but of course they were because budapest is cheap  so many people in these covid times into a strange nightclub with many corridors to apply  just a few hours ago i was talking to my mates how we miss a normal night out oops  further few nights were spent in the capital and i met up with the same girl from lublin  she showed me around the city  and we talk about many different topics thankfully i could escape hungary as i could catch my flight to zakynthos in greece where my solo adventure would end  party time amp x200b any feedback and discussion would be apprenticedinstagram   solo onthelow,0

do you collect anything uniquely meaningful to you when you travel ,i have a shoebox full of mementos from the time i lived in europe   city maps  wristbands  concert tickets  restaurant menus  drink coasters  notes from friends  newspaper clippings  you name it  i was a  very  broke university student  so i couldn t afford many meaningful souvenirs  i had to skip out on a lot of paid museums and restaurants for the same reason  almost all of my money went toward flixbus or budget ryanair flights  spontaneous hostel reservations  and quick stops at grocery stores for beer and whatever cheap groceries i found affordable enough to hold me over for my time there  usually bread  a protein  and my fair share of greasy street food i may not have gotten the most in depth cultural experience in each country  but it was a uniquely humble method of diving in and adapting to each new place  i m not from a wealthy family whatsoever  so the worldly thinking i developed was life changing  the memories i made were well worth the struggles  i keep telling myself i ll go back to some of my favorites someday   i think now i can afford a few  15 meals   i m doing better for myself now  much less vagabond but trying to keep up my share of unique travels  feeling deprived  thanks covid  i pulled my box from the back of a shelf for the first time in about 3 years and was understandably hit with a massive wave of nostalgia  sure  it s just a box of scraps  but to me it s tangible proof that this weird  recurring dream i hold so dearly in the back of my mind was once reality  it s a tiny reminder of the sweet  sweet freedom i once felt as a student  holding these same maps in these same hands as i happily navigated myself through new worlds with pure  bare boned happiness  i realized i ll never be able to share these feelings and bits of memories with anyone but myself but that s what makes the old shoebox so beautiful anyone have similar stories to share edit  thanks for the silver  fellow stranger ,0

anyone have experience driving from the us to monterrey  mexico ,i have a three month furloughing up this summer and i d like to to something fun  last time i had a furlough  i went to peru for a month  this time i m thinking of an extended stay in mexico  specifically monterrey  i live in new mexico  and would cross with my own car  as i would like to bring my two dogs with me  i m interested in probably renting an airbnb for a month or so and just exploring that city area and improving my spanish  i m a solo woman traveler and i m already fluent in spanish  i ve been to mexico a number of times including studying in mazatlan and a two week solo trip to oaxaca and puebla in 2018  all the same  i ve never drove my own vehicle in a foreign country  is the road from laredo to monterey safe  is there anything i should know about driving in that part of mexico  i live in new mexico but specifically chose the laredo route  as it would require the least solo driving in mexico  i know i have to purchase insurance when i cross  but i don t know any specifics of that  i m honestly also interested in getting all the way down to mexico city and seeing guanajato and san luis potosi on the way  but that seems quite overwhelming to me  any thoughts on going that far south by car as well edit  i should have said late summeearly fall  because this wouldn t be until at least august  if not september or october  and actually leaning toward october because my house sitter wouldn t have to water my garden as much  anyway  i would only do it if it s responsible to do it at the time  i m hoping covid will be much more under control by then and i should be vaccinated as well ,0
tourist visas for russia ,so i m based in the uk and once the pandemic hopefully dies down again i m hoping to travel in russia  it s always been target number 1 on my bucket list  i m a little confounded by the visa application process though  apparently i need a letter of invitation to russia to start the whole process  and that this can be as simple as an invite from a tourism agency  would anyone have any idea how i d be able to go about getting one of those  or what are some trustworthy websites and orpanies i could apply through ,0
hostel vs  hotel vs  airbnb,ok guys  which do you prefer using when you go travelling here s how i see it hostel   cheapest option hotel   most expensive option but more privacy and amenitiesairbnb   great local experience optionif you reing from a western country  i noticed hotels are super cheap in asia and eastern europe so you might as well book one of those  i found hotels for like  20 a night in eastern europe  like legit 3 star hotels  i m from canada where hotels are like  100 usd per night minimum ,0

my work requires me to plan my vacations until mid january   but this year ,i get thirty holidays and i ve  saved  up five days worth of overtime from last year  usually i do three weeks in april and three weeks in november  as things are going i won t be able to do a trip in april this time of course  access to the vaccine is relatively unclear at this point  though it seems likely that here in germany you will be able to get a vaccine as a healthy person in summer  to be safe i was thinking about putting in three weeks in late novembeearly december  but what to do with the rest  i m afraid of planning   let s say three weeks in june and then losing out because of bad luck  that s why i m then considering to spread it out a bit with shorter trips  current plan looks like this    july  2 weeks in spain  or somewhere else in europe  september  2 weeks in the us  or someplace else with a large amount of vaccinated people  december  3 weeks in mexico do you think this is realistic or should i spread it out further with smaller trips  problem is the more trips you take the more money you spend and only being at work for 3 4 weeks for half of the year sounds like it d break up my workflow too much ,0

how much money would i realistically need to travel continuously for 3 6 months ,i am a 21 year old located in australia  initially i was very career driven but now i am starting to realise that covid aside  i may never be in a better position to travel than i am now i am currently on a  63k salary with about  10k in savings  i would like to quit my job this next year  depending on the covid situation  and travel for a few months before getting another job  i am single and live pretty cheaply  so i envisage my savings increasing over the next few months i have an undergraduate law degree and about 4 years of work experience behind me  so i feel fairly confident that i wouldn t be rendered unemployable by an extended travel period i realise that living costs vary but i am not fussy on travel locations   i just like to see new places  would i be able to support myself on  20k in a foreign country  or do solo travellers pick up odd jobs along the way  i would love any and all advice ,0
australia working holiday  or not  having problems with anxiety and solo travelling ,hi all  i m hoping to go on a 417 australian working holiday in january 2022  assuming that boarders are open  and things are relatively back to  normal  and so  looking for some advice  i ve really dreamt of this trip for the last 2   3 years  researched and planned in depth  and used it as motivation to get to the end of uni  it would be a post graduate travel gap year  at some points  it s been all i could think about  the sun on my skin  seeing the blue mountains  taking a surf lesson  sailing the whitsundays  however  now that it s bing  real  and i m getting closer to having to make actual decisions e g applying for a visa and booking flights  i m getting a bit nervous  i m a fairly reserved and introverted person with  to be honest  a fair amount of general and social anxiety  i ve lived by myself  a few hours from home  for the last year  and have traveled both locally and abroad many times before   with friends and family  here  on holidays  i usually love every minute  largely the  doing  element  the activities  the sights and experiences etc  but i ve not travelled by myself before  let alone stayed in a hostel  and now  am questioning whether i can follow through with what i would love to do vs  what i m capable of doing  a few family members  who i m sure mean well  have basically told me not to go  due to my quietness and   or because of going by myself  i don t know any friends or family who are either not in uni or work  or who are financially stable enough etc  whilst my best friend encourages me to go for it so  any tips   experiences   suggestions for  solo travelling for the first time  for females  in particular    anxiety and travelling    solo travelling   anxiety whilst on an australian working holiday   please try to be constructive  not criticising thank you in advance ,0
happy new year  and decade ,hey folks  it s been an interesting year to say the least haha   and i m looking forward to being able to  solo  travel again  an interesting experience with solo travel   last year i traveled by myself to quebec city for new years  and i ve done solo new years another time in montreal  and had a lot of fun with folks i met there today as i m wishing people a happy new year  besides my family  funny enough the group that we formed last year  also on whatsapp  for new years feels more like the group of people i d love to spend another new year s eve with there s something quite fascinating about the relationships you make when you solo travel   neither of you expect much from the people long term   but for the time y all are together  it does feel like a greatunity  happy new year y all   and i m optimistic about things getting better down the line  edit  i didn t realize how popular this feeling was  gives me even more confidence that solo travel will remain fun   thanks folks ,0

travel insurance,bit of a confession here  some of you will probably think its stupid of me but i havent really bought travel insurance for most of my trips  especially for the two  multi countries  trips  thankfully nothing happened to me for them  e g  ended up in the hospital lost some valuables etc obviously  this is bad but has anyone else just go ahead and travel without them  and to those who gets travel insurance like normal people  which one do you suggest on getting  uk based if that helps  reasons i dont get it is because  either i get really excited and forget about it or just see it as another expense i could get away without  but i know if shit hits then fan  it will cost me much more than getting one in the first place to those who have claimed  what happened and how does the process go  e g  losing an item on a trip  i plan to take just one rucksack for my next trip in the near future hopefully and that would mean putting a camera along with my other things   maybe insurance would help just in case i end up losing forgetting stuff while packing on the go ,0

getting robbed and losing visa advice experiences,i m trying to understand what people do in the case of getting robbed when moving between locations   ie where you haven t been able to stow your passport and backup cash and card at a hotel hostel  worst case scenario you lose it all  and find yourself without a passport  phone  cash cards  your backpack  etc  i know you need to make your way to an embassy  but how do you do that with no money or identification  i m assuming it would be incredibly difficult to get a replacement cc in a foreign country within any reasonable timeframe  and you have no identification for someone to wire you money  without relying on a good samaritan  what do you do   anyone end up in a situation like this ,0

to people that are traveling during this time  are you enjoying it ,was just thinking recently about like my goals to live abroad and travel with the mindset of  i ll do this when the pandemic ends  i realized part of the desire to travel for me is not just like sightseeing and doing outdoorsy things alone  but it s like going to museums  parties  nightclubs  and restaurants  meeting people in different languages things that likely aren t options in many places  so if i were to actually travel now  i don t even think i would have as much fun i could just travel an hour outside my city and go hiking or something  so i guess my question to people that are traveling now or soon  what are you doing or planning to do to make it fun despite covid restrictions ,0

question s  about whv in oz  nz,i plan to apply for one of these in early 2022 so i can have a longer term  sustained travel through oceania without cutting too deep into my nest egg for further sea  steppe solo travel afterwards  i know that the visa is predicated on having short term  non career based jobs during the stint  my question is  besides seasonal farmhand  what is actually allowed by this  and how is the legality determined  i have a few years of experience as a semi nomadic engineer in mechanical  structural  and manufacturing environments  would something like a term limited contract job in this field be allowed  either something like a graduate level apprenticeship  lab manu technician  or construction job in structures hvac besides unskilled labor  i understand the availability of them is nigh unpredictable  i m more so curious if it s even legally pursuable  also  it seems likepletion of a whv has no impact on future long term visa acceptance  is this correct  i ask because i m fairly certain to relocate from usa to either nz or germany permanently after 10 15 years of a semi nomadic living  and havingpleted my degree in germany i have an advantage there  would a year of life work in nz have no impact at all on future consideration  lastly  any personal anecdotes on your personal experience with work holiday visas would be appreciated   strengths  weaknesses  would do it again  wouldn t ever consider it  etc ,0
australian visa,i cant find a proper group for this question  but i need help hello  in may 2019 i went to perth on a working holiday visa  first year  to be an aupair  i left august 28 so i could go back home to toronto and go to school  while i was there i met my boyfriend and have since decided to move to perth to go be with him  i know right now with covid we will be waiting for a bit and trust me i m well aware of that whole situation  my question is this  can i apply for the second working holiday visa  or is there a time frame i missed  i heard that i may not be ablate enter for another 3 years  or if there is an option to reapply for the first working holiday  when i go next i want to be there for a year and hopefully apply for a partner visa while i m there  not yet though  i m just confused as to what visa would work  i ve looked everywhere  thanks update just wanted to add some information after reading someents  i m currently 20 years old  i didn t do any of the needed work in order to qualify for a second working holiday  i arrived may 2019 and left august 2019  therefore my visa was good until around may 2020  so it has since then expired  my hope was being able to possibly reapply for the first one and then do the work  but i no longer think this is the case though it would be easier  i m looking at partner visas but they re very expensive and take a while to process  i m still waiting to see on if anything changes with their international travel ban  but if not i m going to start applying for an exemption in february  ,0
getting covid in a foreign country while traveling,question for those still solo traveling during the pandemic has anyone gotten covid while in a foreign country  i don t plan to travel until the vaccine  but i m really curious how people are handling this obviously it would be very unethical to move about  once you have symptoms  so what do you do  cancel all forward  or return  travel until you clear a pcr 2 3 weeks later  tell the hotel you are sick and can t leave if you are supposed to check out if you are hostel bound  i wonder if they would just kick you out  where do you go from there  seems inappropriate to check in to a new hotel or airbnb once you are sick  and  depending on the country  how do you get food in a safe manner  it all seems quite risky  especially if you don t speak the language   and this is assuming you don t get sick enough to need hospitalization  which seems like another matter entirely ,0

18 y o  first time solo travel to latin america  advice needed,hi guys assuming coronavirus is sufficiently contained by 2021 summer  i was hoping to go solo travelling  i am european and will have finished my final exams  usually people after these exams go travelling with friends around europe  however  i wanted to do something different  it s not that i have no friends to travel with  more that the last few years and my childhood in general have been difficult  and i feel like i am starting a new chapter in my life  as cheesy as it sounds  i am dying for some alone time somewhere foreign  where i can engage my love of travel and learning  as well as taking time for introspection and learning more about myself  i would aim to spend about one month or one month and a half travelling   much more than i could in europe  given that latin america is cheaper from what i understand latin america has always fascinated me  which is why i really want to visit  not only the culture  but also its history and its current interesting socio economic situation  with countries like mexico and brazil straddling middle ie status  next to more developed nations like chile and uruguay  i am fairly fluent in spanish  approx  c1 level  and am learning portuguese i should mention right off the bat that i m a city guy  i like buildings  i like museums  architecture  learning about the history and socio economic and political situation of different places around the world  that said  i can and do appreciate nature when i get the chance  i m just not the type to go hiking and trekking  more the type to sit and admire the scenery with that all said  i have a few questions what is the ideal itinerary  i had a few different ones in mind gt  is by bus   gt  is by air belo horizonte  gt  sao paulo  gt  curitiba  gt  iguazu falls  gt  buenos aires  gt  santiago  gt  lima  amp  cusco or bogotaorbuenos aires  gt  ushuaia  gt  buenos aires  gt  mendoza  gt  santiago  gt  lima  cusco or bogotaor somebination of the two  other cities of interest are florianopolis  porto alegre and asunci n  nothing is concrete yet  i m really just playing around with ideas right now  from what i understand  many of the nature parks in south brazil aren t accessible by public transport  which is why i haven t considered them 2  as a first time  male  solo traveler  is visiting latin america   brazil in particular   a good idea i am well aware that there are crime problems in brazil  although most of the dangerous cities appear to be in the north east  where i don t plan on going  i have still heard bad things about sao paulo  and even worse things about rio  which is why i haven t even considered rio for travel at all  and am cautious about considering porto alegre  please do tell me if this is silly or not  i have never had a gun pulled on me  or been the victim of violent crime  the only  robbery  i have experienced are street muggings by unarmed people when i was younger however  i should also mention that my family is of indian origin  my family in india  who i regularly visit  live in a fairly poodeprived part of delhi  so i m not unfamiliar with the diforts of travelling in less developed regions  i have visited chicago  washington d c  and the outskirts of detroit  if that makes a difference i am also fortunate enough to be fairly well travelled with my family  we tend to do budget city breaks when we travel in europe  which entails using lots of public transit  and sometimes staying in slightly shadier parts of town  again  i am aware european  danger  is nothing relative to brazil with all this mind  am i too  inexperienced  to go to brazil  and or colombia  what about buenos aires  patagonia and santiago thanks for reading this far and for any help  and i ll repeat this is all very very speculative at the moment and something i am only just considering as a possibility  so if this is a crazy dumb idea do say so i am aware that this is very hopeful thinking  which is why i am not taking this plan overly seriously  i am not booking anything anytime soon  if it is not safe enough to travel in 2021 summer  i would still like to do this trip the following year  so any advice is still appreciated ,0

how to financially sustain yourself during long term traveling ,i went on a date a few months ago with someone who had spent 3 years of his life just freely traveling the entire world  it s something i ve always dreamed of doing and i want to get plans underway  but something i didn t get to ask him  and can t now because he ghosted me  was  how does one sustain themselves financially while traveling for 3 years  my best guess would be he must ve picked up odd jobs along the way  but i don t even know how one goes about finding odd jobs to pick up  do you just ask around  how do you distinguish a financial opportunity from a labor trafficking trap  hopefully this doesn t sound too na ve  i genuinely want to learn how this works and have nobody in my life to ask  for context  i m female  american  in my mid 20 s  white  and have very limited language expertise  but am working on learning secondary languages  if anyone has any advice or resources to help me learn more about this  it would be greatly appreciated amp x200b edit  this got way more replies than i anticipated  thank you to everyone who s shared so far  i ve been reading and learning so much and look forward to gaining more knowledge about this  it s really helping me figure out what the different options are ,0

crazy hostel experiences,so  i m not solo travelling  i m backpacking with my boyfriend  but i thought this would be the best place to share my crazy experience  moved into a hostel about 2 days ago  due to start working for aodation on saturday for hostel  so currently still paying  the room i ve moved into is next to a noisy room  where people want to stay up late  have their friends in the room til late playing music  banging door to get in  it s annoying so after the second night of this happening  wakes me up at 1 30am  i ve got work all day for a client so not good    i knock the door ask them to turn music down  ignored  knock again  finally stops  the next morning  i realise the noisy person is also the night manager and the cleaner  who angrily barks at people who don t clean up after themselves  so instead of going straight to reception toplain  i decide to speak with my new colleague now she is sober  and it s morning to ask her to go downstairs next time she hosts a party because we re neighbours  she goes crazy  mental  before i know it  she s cornering me in the bathroom threatening to punch me in the face  i can t move  she s actually physically blocked me with the steam cleaner  i keep my cool  stand my ground  until a girl brushing her teeth breaks it up  but she s not finished with me  she returns seconds later  telling me how she s going to shove my head in the toilet  at this point   i go to the manager  who is alreadying out to see what the racket is all about  but the girls following me down the corridor  telling me about how she can t wait to put my head in shit  an hour later  she is removed from the hostel and ever since she has been wandering the street  walking around the block for a good solid 6 hours    i guess my reason for posting and interest is  anyone else experienced this level of crazy in hostels  or worse  let s share stories ,0
pre travel anxiety,i am 20 yo and for the last 5 years i ve had crazy pre travel anxiety and i really need some help because all the posts i have seen it is almost always about things you can write down and get over with  every time i have to travel  even if i have done the same trip  even if the trip is short like 3 4 hours and not only by plane but by train or ship or car  i get a tremendous amount of anxiety to the point i consider canceling the whole trip  for example i have to travel today by train  4 hour trip  to get to my home city for christmas and even though i have done this trip many times  i still feel very anxious before the trip  these past years i have been basically living with it and not really caring about it  i just know i am going to get anxiety and i just try to go with it and feel bad for the rest of the trip  i have gotten to the point where i vomit because of my anxiety especially when it is at its peak  minutes before the trip begins  ruining my day both emotionally and physically  also i have to say that i really like traveling and visiting new or old places and different countries but i have to deal with this anxiety  what i mostly feel is stomach ache  nausea  short breathing  dry mouth  generally sick  also i know for a fact that i am not afraid of flights  money problems if i lose a connection or anything like that  it just happens when i have to travel  the rest of the time i am very healthy and energetic  i would really like to know if anyone else has this and if they have found a way to cope with it ,0

how much do you travel with ,i ve been planning my first ever trip out of the country and i m curious how much you all take with you  especially for long trips i feel like i can get away with just a backpack but i m curious about everyone else s experiences edit  i plan on traveling for around a month in wintespring edit 2  my planned destination is japan in early 2023  far away  i know  but i d rather think about this stuff now ,0
thinking about eastern europe in spring  any thoughts ,in march i m making a big move across country and want to take the trnsition as an oppurtunity to do a quick month in eastern europe  when i started thinking about doing this trip  i figured the world would be mostly back to normal by springtime and obviously that s not the case  as i get older  i m finding less and less time to be able to do long term travel and i d hate to give up this opportunity while i have the time  but obvi i don t want to travel while things are so uncertain  i guess i just want to see what other solo travelers think about traveling to that region  or anywhere i suppose with the world as it is  would it even be worth it  would most things be open  would i get to even see much all things considered ,0
trip report  russian federation  september   october 2020,hey brothers and sisters after making a lot of research i took the chance and visited russia for 30 days in september and october 2020  russia was always a dream destination for me and i was happy that i could still pull it off this year  despite all the obstacles that corona put upon us disclaimer  i am aware that i visited russia as a foreign citizen for recreational  touristic purposes during a global pandemic  i hereby declare that everyone willing to travel should do his her careful research about travelling in this era and what the the possible consequences of such a trip are  i therefore am not endorsing nor discouraging anyone from doing a trip nowadays   i m just saying that you should do your careful research first background  29m swiss  mostly have adventurous backpacking experience in asia  very interested in russian   former soviet culture and history  i can read cyrillic and have some very basic duolingo russian skills  but apart from that i can t understand sh  and are pretty bad at everything  the trip took place between september and october 2020  right before the corona numbers again went off the roof   budget  about usd 50 per day  not including airfare or visa fees etc  because of the current global situation the highest expenditure was the flight zurich moscow and back  which only operated twice a week  but because my flight options were pretty limited i swallowed this bitter pill and did it length of travel  30 days destinations  not including daytrips  saint petersburg  petrozavodsk  moscow  volgograd  simferopol  sevastopol  yalta  vladikavkaz  grozny  erzi  southern ingushetia aodations  either cheap hotels  found via hotelbined or agoda  or at friends  or at guides  homes arrival  the corona pandemic makes planning an international trip obviously much more difficult than normally  while getting the 30 days visa was not a problem  only citizens from switzerland  uk or turkey could obtain tourist visas at that time  i also had to get a negative pcr test result 72 hours prior to my flight  in english or russian language  this already set me back quite some money and time  at the airport in switzerland my test result was checked very carefully by the departure staff and arriving in moscow domodedovo the russian officials again checked the result along with my current body temperature  the procedures at immigration and security didn t take too long though  about 1 5 hours  since there were almost no travelling tourists but only returning russian citizens  many people were quite amazed to see a foreigner traveling at that time  immediately after getting my backpack from the baggage claim i headed to the domestic check in counters and took a domestic flight to saint petersburg  which also worked flawlessly activities  visiting the many landmarks in saint petersburg  such as peter  amp  paul  artillery museum  peterhof or kronstadt  visiting kizhi island and renting a car to visit other landmarks in karelia  such as ruskeala  visiting moscow and its many landmarks  such as red square  kremlin  bunker 42  federation tower or monino aircraft museum  visiting suzdal  golden ring  and its many churches and monasteries  visiting volgograd and its landmarks such as rossoshka cemetary  square of the fallen fighters  the war museums  mamayev kurgan  visiting the southern part of crimea  such as simferopol  sevastopol  yalta and bakhchysarai  lots of daytrips such as to artillery bay  crimean war panorama  chersonesus ruins  maxim gorky fortress  submarine base in balaclava  cape fiolent  ai petri or chufut khale  vladikavkaz  karmadon gorge and the necropolis in darvgas  grozny and a wonderful trek in galanchezh region of chechnya  southern ingushetia including treks to table mountain and erzi national reserve what went right  pretty much everything major   despite the limitations by corona everything in general went smooth without any incidents  most landmarks and transporation options worked flawlessly what went wrong  some few landmarks like ostankino tower in moscow were closed without aent due to the corona measures and sadly couldn t be visited  also many western bank cards  credit cards and sim cards won t work in crimea due to western sanctions  meaning you need to have some backup  also because of annoying corona measures i lost one day of travel between north ossetia and chechnya  which is a long story though rendations  go to russia  especially when the whole corona circus is over final verdict  while maybe not as super adventurous and wild as south east asia or the middle east  russia is a phenomenal mix of european and oriental influences with extremely many facettes pared with other regions in the world it s also a safe and stable destination for a backpacking trip  locals are lovely and hospitable people  especially in the countryside and in the south  the country simply has everything to offer for every taste  and even within 30 days you can only explore a fraction of the whole picture  while it was not my absolute favorite solo backpacking experience  that would rather be iran or vietnam  russia is still very high in my personal list and i rend anyone to visit it when things calm down again massive imgur photo album with explanations   ,0
the bitter sting of failed travel romance,i met this guy  currently travelling in latin america  we spent almost a week together whilst staying in the same hostel  kept in touch almost daily for a week afterwards and then tried to get things back on track when we met again in another city  though within a week it had collapsed  i won t go into detail other than saying it failed because he was a lot less emotionally mature than i was  and i ignored a lot of red flags because our attraction was so intense 3 weeks to be connected to someone whilst travelling felt like such long time  we were super into each other and even spoke about having feelings for each other and he even alluded to us having future on several occasions   we ended it 3 weeks in and it hurt both of us  we carried on staying in the same town for 2 weeks afterwards and had some miserable and heated run ins  he finally left yesterday and wouldn t even say goodbye to me  it s a good thing he s gone but equally it really hurts and i feel quite empty has anybody else experienced similar  i swear it s those  almost  situationships that hurt the most  and leave you feeling so stupid for getting so carried away in such a short space of time   ,0
when would you feel confident enough to travel internationally again ,sorry if this is a repeat post or anything  curious how other solo travelers are thinking about this would you do anything differently post pandemic  this is independent of destination  just when you personally would realistically book a trip internationally  obviously  there has been news around the vaccine  but i think the unique risks of traveling alone make it something to be wary about and you can t be too safe right now edit  sorry for not adding a  now  option  i didn t think about that to bepletely honest view poll ,0
as an american  i m really nervous about being able to go on a good solo trip again before starting a career ,i know i m not original in my sentiments here i had just discovered how much i love international solo travel earlier this year before the pandemic spread far and wide  i was going to make plans to travel more over the summer before going back to school  it would have been perfect  because i wanted to go backpacking once more before getting immersed in my career  obviously  we ve all had to make some sacrifices i am going back to school forputer science  and as much as i love it  i m concerned that i shouldn t make theitment yet  in the us as far as i m concerned  it s standard to only get two weeks of vacation time a year  seeing as how i am not expecting to travel any time soon  even with the vaccine being deployed  i m so scared  especially because if i don t get an internship this next summer  i ll have to get one the next  and then i should be ready to graduate  and a gap on my resume would look bad  i think i would love to be a digital nomad  but i don t know how realistic that is  especially since i haven t really honed my cs skills yet  i would also really love to move to another country  but i know how hard that is to do  too  especially since english is my only language any thoughts  advice  or similar feelings  sorry if i sound whiney  traveling and experiencing new places  cultures is really what makes me feel happier to be alive  these past few months have been hard with nothing to look forward to amp x200b edit  i should specify  i am getting a master s degree  i m 27  still young  i know  but the sense of urgency is kicking in ,0
tips to meet people while solo traveling  even if you re awkward af like me ,iented on someone s post about this but figured i d make a whole post  i m a huge fan of making friends while traveling and still keep in touch with random one off friends i made in weird places  i think it s a special bond  here are some ways i break the ice   note  i ve been on both sides of this as the lone traveler who has met and made friends with other solo travelers and groups  as well as the person in a group who has absorbed an orphan traveler into our group for the day week   these have worked for me   wear or carry something distinctive  something that relates to your hobbies or passions  i put stickers on literally everything and all my stickers relate to my hobbies interests bands shows books  so many people will stop and be like  ahh  hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy sticker  or  the office   even though everyone loves the office  doesn t matter  talking about  something  leads to talking about anything  more people than you realize want to make friends  they just feel weird as hell like you do  i live in alaska so if i put something that says alaska on it  people will inevitablyent on it  but  be wary of geographically identifiable clothing as it can make you a target as a tourist in less safe places   just ask people why they re traveling and where they re from  everyone thinks they re a grand explorer when they leave home and they re dying to talk about it   be interested in listening  don t feel pressured to talk  being interested is way more effective in making connections than being  interesting  as people are more likely to want to hear your stories if they feel bonded to you and not like you re some weird stranger  vomiting your story all over them  so ask questions and actually listen  listening is super rare and always extremely appreciated   act open and excited  people are drawn to that shit  don t be weird  but don t be jaded  sometimes anxiety can manifest as someone looking bored disinterested  but nobody wants to have to pry someone out of their shell to get to know them  be mindful of your paralanguage  non verbals  and how closed off you seem   practice trying new social techniques  if you fuck it up and make it weird  you will literally never see them again and nothing matters  i ve done some insanely awkward shit in the name of travel and while i didn t always make a lifelong friend  i definitely have some interesting stories   be open to new things  just because something doesn t sound fun  doesn t mean it can t lead to something fun  sometimes i think we travel to distant lands just to do the same shit we do back home  challenge yourself  your routine will always be waiting for you back home  for example  i went motorbiking in bermuda for the first time  it was scary as hell and my new friend broke her ankle and i accidently drove into a prisonplex but did i have fun  fuck yeah   don t wait for others to do a cool thing  do that cool thing and you will invariably find people there who do cool things  your friends don t want to go to an irish pub in motherfucking ireland  well guess what that pub is full of  people who want to be in irish pubs     take an active interest in the local culture  locals love sharing the regional drama  love being experts in their country  and delight in foreigners who aren t just there to see that one tourist destination  most of them willplain about tourists  and that s half the fun  like i said  in alaska we joke about tourist hunting season andplain about how our downtowns are flooded with outsiders every summer  but given the chance we will regale you with our crazy outdoor adventures and brag about how our cousin s ex boyfriend was a crab fisher on season 3 of that crab fishing show whose name i can t remember   don t be sloppy  nobody wants to hang out a second time with the dumpster person who got blackout and stuck their group with their tab   go on dates   if you re single  obvs  i ve met some cool ass people while traveling and swiping  as long as you re up front about your boundaries and what you re looking for  lots of locals are down for a one off date and they probably know the  cool local spot  that they re excited to show you  i got roasted by judah friedlander at aedy show on a date in nyc once  probably wouldn t have known about it if my dated hadn t told me about thatedy show     lastly  don t get stuck in your demographic  some of the coolest people i ve met while traveling were way older  for example  when i was 26 i did shots in iceland with a 65 year old travel agent while her husband cheered us on and she still sends me periodic updates about her grandkids  old people are cool as hell  hang out with them add your own ,0
how much money do you have at any one time ,are you shoe stringing it and finding just enough work to get place to place do you work in your home country for short periods  save as much as possible  then use all of it for your next trip do you run a successful business or work remotely and are actively growing wealth while you travel curious to hear about everyone s financial styles ,0
why don t people try to fight back muggers in colombia ,from what i understand  going to medellin or bogota ispletely law less  it doesn t really matter how  careful  you are  if someone so much as sees that you have an iphone  you re basically guaranteed to encounter a mugger  from what i understand  it s ashame  can t even check your phone or the time because you want to avoid giving away you have  value  and instantly being marked as a target by potential on lookersmy question is  why don t people fight back  for example  if you know someone is likely to mug you just for walking down the street  why not prepare for it  i ve read people get mugged so easily there  just walking in broad daylight around some people  then 2 guys approach you and pull out a knife  demand your phone  and then run off  and everyone around you just continues on with their day as if nothing happened  cause it s just so normal for that to happenhow about having some mace on hand  so that when you are approached and see the knife  you basically mace the guy in the face  give one swift kick to the balls  then just be on your merry way  it s not like others will stop you from doing this  or you will be caught by cops ,0
kindness to a weary moroccan traveler,i love travelling  i ve been solo traveling since i was in my twenties and actually prefer it because of the adventures i ve had  though i look forward to including my partner one of these days  i m really bummed right now  though about how unsafe and difficult it is to go anywhere  so i ve been thinking about stories from the past  i wanted to share the experience that convinced me to keep solo traveling in 2007  i was a university student during a year abroad in canterbury  england  on the advice of some people who had been in my program the year before  i decided not to go home  back to the states  for christmas  but instead stay there and use the time for traveling  while most of my friends were going to amsterdam for the legal pot  i had my heart set on going to morocco because i wanted to experience northern africa  the first time i would be in a country where i was not the dominant race  i figured that it would be perfect to spend christmas there since  as a predominantly muslim country  i figured most business would be open through the season so  once classes were out for the winter break  i took a ryanair flight over to barcelona and spent a week in spain before hoping on a bus from madrid to the port city of algeciras to catch the ferry over to tangier now about all that went as expected was i found where to purchase the tickets for my ferry and went over to the waiting area  i wasn t sure when the ferry would take off  but i figured it had to be soon  so i waited  and waited  and waited some more  i was there hours before it was time  evening slipped into night  and the waiting area was quickly filling up  i sat there until the wee hours of the morning  unsure when i was finally going to get to go but not terribly worried since i had no firm plans  finally they started loading the boat  and i found myself on a cramped ferry and could only plop down on the floor in an empty space  i had no idea why so many people seemed to be trying to get to morocco that night it was early the next morning  around 7 00 am by the time we got to tangier  i was hungry and exhausted and really wanted to find a place to get some rest before continuing on down the coast the next day  as i was disembarking from the ferry  though  i was pulled aside  along with a few other people and had to wait for a rather gruff and unhappy looking customs officer toe talk to me  it turns out that the way customs works on this particular ferry is you get your passport stamped on the boat and then just show your passport as you disembark  there had been announcements but  because they were all in spanish and arabic  i didn t understand them  i was horrified and scared he was going to send me back to spain but  after some questioning  he took out a stamp  stamped my passport  and sent me on my way i immediately realized something was up when i saw people literally on the street corners cooking goats  i woulde to find out that  yes  i had escaped the christian holidays in britain  but my uncultured self forgot to check the muslim calendar  i had arrived on eid al adha  one of the holiest days on the muslim calendar  and i was witnessing people out celebrating and preparing their feast  that s why there were so many people on my ferry  i started to panic  i knew i would be lucky that day to find a meal  much less lodging  that day i had picked out a pension  a small  cheap hotel  to stay in for the night  and found a taxi driver  who had no idea where it was  after driving around in circles  i asked him to drop me back off at the port  and then i realized the pension was only a block from the port on a pedestrian street  i walked up to the pension and stood at the front desk  exhausted  hungry  and more than a bit weary from the last twenty four hours the owner of the pension walked up to the desk  a little surprised to see a customer at this time of the morning  i asked him if he had any rooms  yes  he told me he did  i felt elated  for the first time this trip  something was going right but i will not check you in  he told me  i looked at him  baffled  what was going on  had i already offended him  did i break some taboo without even knowing sensing my confusion  he repeated   i will not check you in  he paused  looked at my face  and smiled   it is a holy day  i will not check you in until you have tea with me it took me a moment to process what he d just said  this man  who didn t know me  who had just met me  was asking me to have tea with him in honor of the eid  i d like to think he saw in my face a weary soul  way out of my element  and wanted to show me some kindness i did sit with him and with an indian man i would find out was a regular at the pension  we talked about life  i told them my story as we had moroccan mint tea with some bread and honey  i told them my story  the indian man was briefly confused when i said i was from indiana  and they told me theirs  we learned about one another that day  i also expressed my fear of not being able to find food on the eid  and the owner reassured me you are staying in my pension  you will eat tonight i was overwhelmed by his generosity and  just before midday  crawled into a bed on the second floor  sleeping sounder than i had in ages that man is why i keep travelling  travelling keeps reaffirming my belief that most people are basically good and want to be good people  his hospitality to aplete stranger who would have stayed at his pension even without it was so touching  i have since encountered generous  kind people in so many countries on multiple continents  the pension owner taught me that  even in a new country where i don t know the language or customs or traditions  even after a long  stressful day  there were people who could touch you and lift your spirits with a simple act of kindness i hope i m half as good a person as that man ,0

does anyone else not meet people when they travel ,i read a lot of stories and threads in this sub that are detailing the amazing experiences that people have meeting other people  sex  travel romance and to me i can t relate to any of that because i never meet anyone when i travel  does anyone else not meet people  i still have fun but all my experiences are solo experiences i ve not had a shared experience before which goes against what this sub usually experiences  people say they meet other people on walking tours  i ve never been on a walking tour that didn t just end at the finish and when we tip the tour guide people just went off and do their own thing  the last two walking tours i went to the majority of people there clearly knew each other and stuck with each other  saying hello to people never seems to go past an introductory phase or the usual  where are you from i ve been on tours and not met anyone  i went on a full day tour that involved boating and everyone there clearly knew each other and had formed their own groups and were talking together in their own languages so i ended up spending the day by myself getting the cuntest sunburn of all time  the most awkward tour was when it was me and these two women who knew each other  there was a 4th person but he cracked the shits about something and went off raging in to the sunrise and after trying to strike a conversation with the others and getting nowhere i just left itin hostels i ve not met anyone either  i usually go out during the day e back for a snooze in the afternoon then go out for dinner and drinks in the evening and maybe it s just bad timing but most of the hostels were either empty in theon area at the time or people were with their friends or doing some undisturbed so i usually do my thing alone  i go to bars alone and don t meet locals but i usually don t speak the language well enough  there was one hostel where there was a group dinner advertised so i went there  sat down  started saying hello and what not and the entire table was speaking french   i was neither in france nor am i french so i just left  on the days where i ve not wanted to do much i noticed most people did the same thing i did going out during the day and night so the hostels were mostly empty and there wasn t a  hey we both got nothing to do let s go do something  person around  maybe it s just me doing something wrong i don t know but my experience of travelling seems to be theplete opposite of the stories people post in here  surely someone else has the same experience when they travel  i don t find it to be the super social experience people say it is but maybe that s because i won t disturb a group if they know each other or speaking other languages to each other which i d consider rude  i ll usually try and say hello how are ya etc like when i was at hostel and got dinner i sat outside on the table and a group was already there but it didn t go further than that  for whatever reason people don t seem receptive to me and timing also doesn t seem to align when meeting people so i usually just end up going to bars by myself  get hammered and find my way home some how it doesn t really bother me too much since i don t have any friends where i live so it s no different and i m used to isolation but i guess i had that expectation that travelling and doing things like tours and staying hostels gets people together when it doesn t end that it doesn t matter where i am in the world i m still the same loser there as i am here,0

when have you splurged way beyond your normal budget and was it worth it ,i stayed for 80 euros for one night in a hotel in northern greece  might not be huge bucks to some but considering i m a life long backpacker who is normally slumming it in 5 12 euro dorms  it s because i was cycle touring and i ended up stranded in a small place with literally no other options  i mean  it was a nice place  breakfast was amazing  room was amazing  you can get very very nice hostels too with nice breakfasts but it did make me feel that for at least one day on every extended trip i should enjoy a taste of the  relative  high life   edit  one nice thing was that  because presumably they aren t used to cycle tourists in nice hotels and the hotel was quiet  low season  i got a bit of the old vip treatment  a very exuberant greek chef came out when i was having my breakfast with an extra dish or two saying things like  this very special greek pie   will give you lots of energy for your cycling  and then gave me a few chocolates to give me more energy for my journey  especially wee as that morning turned out to otherwise be a very rainy miserable morning of cycling  on the other hand  i paid similar for a premier inn some random ass town in southern england when i missed my train and again had no options  and it was literally no nicer  if not less nice  than a good hostel that s hotels though   there s also tours  attraction fees  transport  meals  whole destinations like bhutan  the high arctic  north korea  turkmenistan or pacific islands generally  i ve been to two from that list  papua new guinea and svalbard and both were worth it  i feel this is relevant to solo travel as things like hotels are more expensive to us and we are much more likely to slum it in general  but interested in your takes ,0
which country destination made you truly feel like the adventurers or explorers of the past  ,hey everyone how s it going  if it wasn t for a certain pandemic i would be eagerly awaiting my solo trip to peru and bolivia which isn t going to happen anytime soon so i thought might as well plan my future bucket lists when international travel is allowed again  now i know in this day and age there really isn t any truly  uncharted  territory left and everything has been discovered and if its worth doing i wont be the first one there nor will i be the last  i mean if you really wanted to you can even book a trip to both the north and south pole or even climb mt everest  for a heavy price  i ve been to nepal for ebc and tanzania for mt kili and although they are both extremely popular tourist destinations far from being  uncharted  or  off the beaten path  they still gave me the feeling of being a  adventurer  in a  unknown world  so i m pretty much after locations destinations that gave you the feeling like you are in the unknown wilderness far from civilisation andpletely untouched or forgotten by humanity  essentially if the destination or journey made you feel like the explorers and adventures of old i definitely want to hear about it   thank you for your time and have a great day  take care  ,0
dolomites swiss alps questions,hey y all  i ve been inspired by this subreddit to plan my first solo international trip for next summer and was wondering if anyone with experience in these places could help clarify a few specific things for me or at least point me in the right direction  my first question is that i plan to stay in a lot of rifugios mountain huts in italy and the swiss alps and i notice some websites say to  bring your own sleeping bag  does that mean like an actual sleeping bag you d bring camping backpacking or something else  because i also notice from pictures that the beds have a folded blanket on top of them  also for rifugio locatelli s reservation page  it gives me the option of  beds with bed linen  in 2 3 4 bed rooms  or mattress storage  for aodation type and i can t figure out what the difference is between those  it might be a weird english translation thing  my other question is regarding parking at tre cime to stay at that rifugio  in my current plan  i would arrive there by car in the afternoon  like around 2 or 3pm  but i ve seen the internet say that the parking lot fills up by 10am  i assume people continually leave throughout the day so is it actually possible that i could be blocked out from parking up there that day  even with an overnight reservation up there  thanks  i m from the us and my goal is to go end of august early sept if i m vaccinated by then  probably ,0
what is the most unbelievable thing to happen to you while travelling solo ,one of my favourite things about solo travel is the fact that it forces you to go outside yourfort zone  it s a lot easier to say yes to things you wouldn t usually do and this can result in the most insane hilarious scary incredible things happening which are often some of the best memories of trips away  the one annoying thing i ve found though  is when i get home and i m telling people about my trip  i can sometimes tell that some of my friends think i m bullshitting them with walter mitty esque tales  it doesn t bother me too much but it s sometimes frustrating when i m being honest but i don t have someone to corroborate my story  with that in mind  and with the promise that i ll believe your story no matter how insane it might sound  what is the most unbelievable event  or events  that has actually happened to you on your travels i loved reading all the responses on the thread about people in hostels yesterday  reading your travel stories gave me my first sense of optimism about getting away at some stage when all this is over ,0

who was the oddest person you ever met at a hostel ,i don t necessarily mean it in a sinister way  just like  the most odd bizarre  not old   i was in one of the budapest party hostels about 5 years ago and one of the other solo travellers there was obsessed with chess  would only talk about chess andeered the hostel chess set and went from group to group trying to play it with every guest  absolutely dominated all of them  after the win  he would move on without saying much  on my last day there  i was his lucky chosen one  we started playing  i m shit at chess  he took my queen after 5 or so moves  at this point one of the staff announces that anyoneing on the hostel organised day trip has 10 minutes to meet at the reception before they head off  mr chess must have reserved a place on this trip because he was getting noticeably nervous and prompting me to hurry up everytime it was my turn  i was getting destroyed so i of course purposefully slowed down  the ten minutes passed and he had to leave  our match was far from over and he was freaking out  he insisted that we took a picture of the board and continued where we left off when he returned  he then quickly shovelled all the chess pieces into the box and brought the chess set with him on the day trip  after they left  i packed my stuff and moved on to croatia  i often think about him and wonder if i was the only person he didn t beat on his trip  what were your most odd encounters ,0

buying a ticket for my first every solo trip to japan  should i go threw with it ,i see a lot of people on this subreddit and many different other travel subreddits lining out their iteneraries and plans for their trips next year  with this i feel like i should go threw it but with how bad the virus is atm  i don t know if i should go threw  international travel is still closed to japan and there is speculation that travel might reopen around may ish but it s still just all up in the air  with all this being said though  i contacted like 3 different planepanies  asiana  air canada  and delta  and they all said i ll be able to buy even though it s closed plus about their refund policies  i know this is a personal choice  but should i go threw with this risk for a trip next november  any tips suggestions ,0
how personal is too personal when talking to people in hostels ,i was staying in a hostel and went to the dining room for breakfast  i sat at a table and saw someone at the table next to mine on their own  so thought i d spark up a conversation  i asked about the well being of their family but only got short but polite answers  as they were talking about their father a couple of their friends joined the table and that was the end of our convo  the person i spoke to didn t stay to eat very long and seemed to leave in a hurry  i hoped i didn t make them feel awkward  maybe they aren t a morning person ,0

going to greece next november   aegina vs  mycenae ,i m  hopefully  going to greece in november if the pandemic allows for it to happen by then  i only have three full days  not including the day i arrive and leave  and i m going to be spending 2 of them in athens  for the third day  i d like to take a day trip  but i m not sure where i love history and culture and those are my two main interests in traveling  mycenae is obviously a great historical sight  but i d like to soak in at least one island and explore the natural beauty of greece  since i know that s a huge attraction that all my friends and family tell me i need to see before i leave the country  the problem with aegina though is that i m not sure how lively the islands are during november and whether most stores  restaurants and attractions will still be open during that time of the year  alternatively  i could spend an extra day in greece and try doing both  but then i d have to subtract a day from my istanbul plans  i m currently planning on four full days in istanbul after greece  it would be three if i want to spend another day in greece  i just feel pretty overwhelmed because there are so many options at hand  lol thanks ,0

want to go see the world on my own  but i m not sure if i was built too,hey all  20m here from the uk  for the longest time i ve been fascinated with the countries of the world and the people and cultures in them  i really want to go start seeing them at some point  i have a super strong urge to just travel all over europe this uing spring  provided lockdown is over by then of course  however  i have some conditions that i think will make this quite hard  the big one is that i have a form of asd and therefore can be prone to panic and being overwhelmed in unfamiliar environments  to add to this  i can sometimes have extreme difficulties in socialising because of it  although this has be much less of a problem in recent years  but a few years back when i was travelling in the uk on my own  i ended up having something of a total breakdown and have been put off going abroad ever since  although i am still not sure what incited this breakdown since i was deeply depressed at the time but i m now on medication which has made me much less prone to these incidents  i am not at all experienced with travelling abroad  with the exception of a few days in paris on a high school trip over five years ago lol  mainly because of the fear that my anxiety disorders and depression would just get the better of me for when i travel alone  as it has done domestically  i finish uni next summer  having been locked on my own for nearly half of the three years i had spent there due to covid and whatnot so i m really eager to go explore when it is all over but i m just not sure i have it in me to pull it off successfully  has anyone else had similar experiences before they started solo travelling  i m twenty now but i ve never done anything exciting and i m so desperate to change that for when i can travel again  make the most of living while i m young  you know  because at the moment i just want to live an exciting life but i am just worried that my disabilities and disorders may prevent me from experiencing that  i hope this has made some sense  it sounds childish and stupid i know it s just something i have to live with  all help and words of advice are greatly appreciated ,0

rendations on where i should go   first major solo travel   3 weeks ,hello  hope everyone is staying safe during these crazy times tl drin my early mid twenties from usa and will have about 3 5k to spend on a 3 week trip  trying to decide between  south east asia  japan  or europe or if you have any other recs plz lmk just a little background  i did my first ever backpacking trip with a friend from college in europe for   1 month  it was fantastic  but honestly my favorite part of the trip was when we split up for about a week  no drama or anything  he just went to see family  and i got to experience staying in a hostel by myself and planning all my own activities  i was so surprised at how easy it was to meet people and felt so free not having to plan around someone else that was about 1 5 years ago summer 2019  i know  we got so lucky we got that trip in before all this happened  and honestly  ever since then i ve been dreaming about my next trip  solo  and saving for it  so far i have about 2 5k saved for a trip and am planning to save another 1k in theing year  so  3 5k in total is my budgetafter i get the vaccine and travel is back to normal i m thinking i m going to take 3 weeks off work either 4th quarter 2021 or early 2022 looking for rendations on where i should go  i ve heard south east asia is really good for first time solo travelers and has an established backpacker infrastructure but the only place i m really interested in so far would be thailand  i imagine 3 weeks would be too much time in one country but lmk if you think otherwise or have any other rendations in sea i ve also always been fascinated with japan and really want to visit tokyo osaka  however i know that not much english is spoken and i worry it would be a little too much for a first time solo trip  also japan will be there and maybe better for when i am older  in early mid twenties rn and my last thought is to go back to europe and go to some of the countries i skipped really liked  portugal and spain  or maybe go with the northern route  i did really like europe i know this is pretty vague and i m super fortunate to have still been employed and be able to save this amount for a trip  any rendations would be helpful on those 3 i talked about or honestly if you have an entirely different place i hadn t thought about please do tell and do you think 3 5k is a good budget for 3 weeks  or if that is that overkill  i could always spend less and save the rest for my next solo trip down the line thanks in advance,0

i finally found personal value in keeping a travel log,memories are something that i cherish and travelling brings me some of the most valuable memories i ve ever had  however  some of them are lost from my mind and there are personal experiences that i should record because they were perceived from my own eyes  ears  etc  there are also places that i want to return to  and there s always the possibility that various attractions will be added or modified over time  that is mostly why i want to have a travel log now so that i can personally see history play out with my own eyes and take in my environment in the most gleeful  optimistic way i can  outside of my work a day life  i want to tread wherever i can on my own and find the constantly changing beauties of the world and forever embed those moments into my mind  i ve already been to bangkok  but i d like topare it to the underacknowledged chiang mai  and a travel log will definitely help me with that to the fullest extent possible,0
does anyone else feel like traveling will suck for a couple years after covid ,once most of the world is vaccinated  and assuming things open up enough that we go back to some semblance of normal  millions of people who have been cooped up in their homes are going to want to get out at the same time i expect to see demand for hotels and flights surge  with prices skyrocketing  and travel destinations being swarmed with tourists  as someone who doesn t mind the usual tourists  but finds solace in a quiet  less crowded nook of a city or travel site  i feel like we re not going to get anywhere near that at least for a few years until everyone scratches their travel itch and start to forget about home lockdowns all together  of course  i don t have a crystal ball and could be way off the mark  but i just had this thought recently and was wondering if others feel the same  the first summer after covid is  over  could you see yourself hopping on a flight to somewhere like rome or paris  for example ,0

need help with international phone plans,i m in the process of planning my first solo international trip  optimistically for late spring early summer 2021  and i m at the point where i m trying to figure out what phone plan i need   i am surprisingly technologically inept for being a millennial  so my absolute number one requirement would be convenience and a hassle free experience   essentially  i want to step off the airplane and have my phone work normally as it would at home through my research i am currently leaning towards google fi  it seems to be the easiest to use and also works immediately in most countries   however  i have also seen good things about t mobile plans and of course the very popular andon method of buying local sim cards  however  that adds a few more steps to the process of having my phone operate normally in foreign countries i would appreciate any advice suggestions and i m interested in hearing from google fi users as well   thanks ,0

tour or no tour ,i am in the beginning stages of planning a trip to turkey  at least 10 months out  i initially was going to take a tour through intrepid  i really like the idea that all of my transportation logistics will be handled by someone else and that the price includes some activities  my big hang up with the tour is that i can t choose my own aodations  i enjoy a lot of the research that goes into planning a trip so a tour takes away from it just a little  what do you all think  there are a lot of pros to the intrepid trip but the aodations tho ,0
has anyone from the us tried booking a trip overseas recently ,i have vouchers from iberia airlines left over from covid  they have to be used by june 2021  i keep getting emails from them reminding me to use them  so yesterday i figured why not  i  found a good trip to barcelona  went through the whole process of applying the voucher and putting my credit card info in  and after trying multiple times  it wouldn t accept my payment  my thought process was  i know that we re currently banned from traveling there  but i m hoping we will be able to by the summer  i figured i could just book the trip and if we were still banned  i would reschedule it again  i didn t think that there would be some sort of gatekeeping mechanism in place on the airline website  but i could be wrong i m wondering if anyone else has had this issue with trying to book future trips to places where people from the us are currently banned from traveling ,0
best places in the us for solo women,i realized i haven t traveled much domestically  so would love any suggestions for destinations and journeys in the us for a solo female traveler  some considerations  i ve lived in large east coast cities  nyc boston dc  and in general  would like to avoid spending too much time in very large cities like la etc  i m thinking more like smaller cities  e g  new orleans or portland  me  or non cities  length  2 3 weeks  i d love to see as much of the country i can by train  like how people buy an interrail eurail pass to see europe  i can t drive  and while flying is an option  i d ideally want scenic views during the journey  budget  i m unsure about this  so estimates would be helpful  i ve saved up and was thinking around  4k  and while obviously the less the better  i m willing to go up a bit if that seems unrealistic  i m not seeking luxury  but want to be reasonablyfortable and safe  interests  food is super important  i don t care where i get it from as long as it s delicious  no dietary restrictions  and am very open to trying new foods  i also love to just walk around  surrounded by beautiful scenery or interesting architecture  not as interested in museums or nightclubs  safety  i m a woman of color  so yeah  while i wish this were an irrelevant fact  anything that minimizes my risk of sexual assault racism would be great thanks in advance i m of course not going to be traveling anytime soon  but am vacation planning well in advance to have something nice to look forward to after these grim times ,0

europe in three weeks,so i booked a contiki for april this year  and low and behold covid happens and everything gets cancelled 4 weeks before i m supposed to travel  i ve accepted that it was actually a great thing because i realized that the trip included places i didn t particularly want to see  because it was included in the overall trip  and i don t want to waste valuable time in a bus  so i am going at it alone  i m planning to go to paris  italy  florence  rome  venice  berlin  amsterdam and london    paris 4 days   florence 2 days   rome 3 days   venice  2 days   berlin  3 days    amsterdam  3 days how reasonable does this sound  the contiki trip was 1500 euros for 14 days but from my planning itsing to about 1000 euros  my budget in total is 2000 euros but i can go over   the plan is to just book hostels airbnbs and use flights trains to travel between cities  please rend some trustworthy sights that i can usepare book on  i ve just been using google and going off of that ideally i would love to do some in country local tours to meet people so if there any suggestions for that i would appreciate it too  any advice in fact  it will be my first time and as a female traveler its a bit daunting ,0

serendipitous solo travel moments,i remember when i was making my way from vietnam to thailand  i was sitting in the hanoi airport on the way to bangkok and made eye contact with another traveler taking the same flight  i didn t really think anything of it until we noticed each other again waiting for a taxi in chiang mai  we went our separate ways but were again brought together at a 7 11 a  number of hours later buying the same snacks and water  at this point  we spoke and decided the coincidence was too strong to ignore  we shared the rest of the evening at a nearby bar  had a great conversation  drinks  and food  and then parted our separate ways  it was as if we d known each other for years   such an impactful experience  i tried to get her contact info so we could meet up in the future  but must ve taken it down incorrectly so i never saw her again it s times like these that are my favourite parts of traveling solo   so much freedom to just act on what the world presents you ,0

what s the most affordable city you ve been to with the best amenities for everyday living ,for me it would have to be medellin  you could take the metro and cable car everywhere and uber is dirt cheap  airbnb s are plentiful and you can find nice rooms for 200 a month or sometimes even less  restaurants give great discounts with their  menu del dia  options which helps cut costs even more  on top of this it s a beautiful city with great nightlifte  etc  so far it s been difficult for me to find places thatpare  when things calm down i was thinking of returning to medellin for a while to work remotely  but at the same time i d like to explore other areas  i still haven t gotten the chance to venture out to eastern europe and sea  which are next on my list  in your opinion  what cities make life for the solo traveler really easy without breaking the bank ,0
greece may 2021 questions,seeking feedback on a planned solo trip to greece 2021  covid situation dependent i m primarily interested in hiking exploring with bars and music at night  beaches are nice  but swimming not a focus on this one  i m date flexible  but trying to balance good weather  not a fan of overcast  and meeting other travelers with beating the stampede  tentative schedulemay 4 5th  usa  gt  athens  get in 10pm may 6th or 7th   gt  rhodes possible ferry to fethiye bodrum in here may 12th   gt  cretemay 16th   gt  athensmay 17th  delphi day tripmay 18th   gt  usa   date questions 1  is this too early weather wise  i m under the impression that rhodes especially  but also crete will likely have sunny weather  and great temp for hikes  but would bumping to mid end of may be wise  2  likewise  from a seasonal perspective  i know covid adds uncertainty here  but should stuff mostly be open by early may  will anyone be around  as a solo  i certainly don t want to be in a ghost town  crete vs paros naxos my first choice is probably paros naxos instead of crete since it s so huge and intimidating with the limited time i have  i also like being able to day trip from paros to naxos for hiking  and possibly santorini  however  i m under the impression crate should be much more active by early may than paros naxos and much easier to get to from rhodes  is this likely the case  is it worth pushing to mid end may and switch to paros  turkeyis it worth making time to hit fethiye or bodrum from rhodes  especially if i can extend the trip by a few days  i d really like to do it  assuming the ferries will be running at that time  and it won t be a headache  i ve been reading a ton of info online about solo traveling greece  but i d love any advice anyone can give about where and when to go  and tips for solo in the greece islands  thanks ,0
i m lost  i want to live abroad but i don t know if it s possible or where to start  just kind of poured my thoughts out and would appreciate insight or advice  not sure where to ask so i just posted here  sorry if it doesn t belong , preface as to where i m at with school and how i feel about jobs  i m a junior in high school anding to terms with the fact that i have an entire life ahead of me independent from my parents  i have to make something of my life  i have to find fulfillment and happiness  and at the same time be self sufficient  there are an inconceivable amount of possibilities yet i have to hone down on a singular path  i have to take a first step and i don t exactly know what it should be  school has been a mess and i have absolutely zero passion or interest in any class i ve taken  i suppose some aspects of literature and history have been interesting here and there  but the work revolving around anything related to school is so draining  it s incredibly hard to motivate myself to do homework or to study and i can t imagine pursuing an actual career related to the subjects i ve stumbled across  the thought of being rooted in one place pursuing some career in whatever field my college degree happens to be in sounds horrible  there s something about tasks that require lots of thinking where i m expected to meet a deadline that doesn t click with me  writing essays  studying calculus  reading about cellular respiration  and anything in between is incredibly hard  i just can t focus on it  i have a much easier  relaxing time doing mundane  physical tasks like mowing a lawn or stocking shelves than i doplex tasks that require deeper thought  maybe it s like this for everyone  but i guess i don t have the stamina or willpower for it  it s too hard and too stressful  if i m going to have to work to make money i d rather it be something easy than it be something hard  i m content with the thought of working a low paying  low skill job for the rest of my life  i feel it s wishful thinking to believe there s a sizable chance i ll find a job that i enjoy doing  and i m sure most people end up not liking the job they get stuck with  might as well cut my losses rather than try to grasp at something that s not there   travel related part this leads me to my issue  there is an abundance of trades that pay relatively well  or even just jobs managing the local walmart or whatever  but anything in the states just sounds boring and depressing  living in the same town for years on end is boring  the world genuinely interests me and i want to explore it  i want to travel  and not the sight seeing vacation type  but just experience everything  i wanna be able to settle down in any old european town and live there until i grow bored of it and wish to seek a new culture or landscape  i don t care for the materialistic side of things like having a nice home or nice cars  as long as i have my basic necessities covered and i m not homeless i m sure i ll be fine  the problem is i don t know if it s possible to pick up jobs in foreign countries  especially if i m not fluent in the language  i don t know if i ll just be able to show up in a city and find employment relatively quickly  maybe i will need to settle down someplace in the states and work to save money by living below my means so that i can afford to travel the world x amount of months out of every year  it s so overwhelming and i m having trouble articulating my thoughts  i really do just want to go out and explore the world  live my life in the moment  i don t want to be tied down with a family driving my kids to soccer every weekend  working my 9 5 so that i can pay the mortgage on my house in the suburb and put food on the table  i m just scared i m gonna graduate and go move to europe with 10 000 dollars in my bank account  stay for a month unable to find employment and end up on the streets with nowhere to go  maybe i should get a college degree so i have something to default on  i just want to live this nomadic lifestyle and experience what there is to experience  but i don t know where to start  i don t even know if it s possible  i m not even sure this entire rant even makes sense  but i d appreciate any advice or insight ,0
does it make sense to solo travel your own country ,some context  i have traveled by myself in other countries  due to the covid thing  i ve been thinking about doing a solo roadtrip across my whole country my country is pretty small  have you ever done something like that  if so is it as enterteining as in a different country ,0
so is everything going to be fully books overstretched insanely crowded at some point in the next two years ,maybe i m selfish asking this but can t be the only one wondering  it seems the whole world wants to travel at once as soon as it s safe to do so bine that with lots of businesses that would serve tourists having presumably collapsed and the result will not be good ,0
spending christmas new years eve on the road,hey folks  has anyone here spent christmas and or new years eve solo travelling  if so  where did you go and how was the experience been i ve travelled for 2 years in a row now to belgium and germany for the days between 26th dec to 31st   usually non eventful days off for me anyway so i just go on a quick trip to europe  for me  i actually enjoy going for a quick trip during those times  its very quiet as you would expect  but to me its actually nice to walk around and see the sights in peace away from large crowds its ironic as well because i feel the  christmas spirit  more so when i am away from home  maybe due to the extremely cold winter and the chance to drink gluhwein or whatever haha i m thinking of actually spending the whole period abroad   obviously not this year but maybe for next nye and beyond  i normally stay in hostels  wonder if they are empty by new years eve possibly just around europe again to save a bit would like to hear your experiences ,0

any painters on the road  what s in your bag  tips ,i ve just recently started to pick up watercolor as a stress relief hobby  i used to paint for fun in school  but stopped over a decade ago losing all my penmanship and dexterity since i only use my hands for typing these days  i m just starting to relearn everything  but really liking it so far  i like the idea of plein air painting  i love the quiet people watching moments that solo travel allows  when you have all the time in the world to sit and soak in the ambiance  usually i just absent mindedly drink some coffee and leave when i m done  but i figure plein air painting would be a great way to really appreciate my environment andit it to memory  there s been so many instances solo traveling where i want to soak in my environment and have an excuse to sit around for an hour lol  does anyone else paint on the road  if so  what are your supplies  do you have any advice or rendations  i ve bought one of those mini tins that can cram 18 watercolour half pans  but i m looking for small brushes and other mini equipment that won t take up much space  i m into minimalist travel  and it d be great if i could find supplies to fit in small spaces for backpack less day trips  eg with a small fanny pack or crossbody purse edit  dimension wise  i m a fan of flat and wide rather thanpact and bulky  i know there s all in one field kits like  this  but i d rather have a thin flat metal palette and carry water in a separate small container  rather than have a big bulky plastic contraption  also  i m on a budget and am loathe to  spend like  70 on brands like schminke  lol  at least for the time being ,0

does this look as bad as it looks  awkward solo travel moment ,i was on a plane from tangier to rome seated next to a very sweet old lady wearing a hijab  she spoke no english  and i speak no arabic nor spanish  though between us we made a little headway with our equally shaky french and plenty of friendly gesticulating at some point in the flight i realised i smelled very much like a smelly backpacker  so  when i had to go to the bathroom  i took my roll on with me to freshen up a bit out of consideration for my friendly seatmate  i was in the plane s toilet cubicle and there wasn t much left in the roll on bottle  one of those nivea ones with the thick gel liquid stuff  so i shook it to get it the dregs to go onto the ball horrifyingly  the ball popped off the end of the bottle  which has  never ever  happened to me before  and the fucking deodorant flung out in a slash all over the mirror  basin and my jeans  the deodorant gel was white  not clear  so i started panicking and thinking  i have got to get this off my pants  i tried wiping it with toilet paper but that just pilled and made grains of toilet paper stick to my leg and crotch in an incriminating blotchy white line it definitely looked as bad as it looked  i d been in the bathroom for ages at that point and eventually had to head back to my seat with a long white stain down the groin and left leg of my black skinny jeans  there was nothing discrete about my re entry and my new friend refused to gesticulate with me for the rest of the trip  shame   a lost opportunity par for the course of travelling on your own is that you ll make a boob of yourself sometimes  i guess that s true for life in general ,0
month long solo uk trip   summer 2021   is this feasible ,hey solotravel with news of the vaccine being great across the board  so far and fingers crossed  i am starting to look to europe for a long awaited solo trip  i am specifically planning a trip  around the uk in the june for a little over a month  and i am curious of everybody s thoughts around here on the details of my trip  specifically from a solo traveler perspective because i ll be totally alone for basically all of this and i figure folks around here have done similar trips in the past i am an american and i have never been to the uk  only been to europe once as a high schooler in italy  so i am a noob across the board  but i really want to see a bunch of stuff   here s my trip outline   london    june 2nd june 7th  4 full days  in london  2 travel days in out   liverpool    june 7th june 10th  1 full day  in liverpool  1 day trip to manchester  2 travel days in out   edinburgh    june 10th june 15th  4 full days in edinburgh  1 day trip to loch lomond  2 travel days in out   glasgow    june 16th june 20th  3 full days in glasgow  two travel days in out   belfast    june 20th june 23rd  2 full days in belfast  2 travel days in out   dublin    june 23rd june 25th  2 full days in dublin  2 travel days in out   birmingham    june 26th july 2nd  3 full days in birmingham  1 day trip to oxford  1 day trip to cambridge  2 travel days in out   london    july 2nd july 6th  3 full days in london  2 travel days in out when i say travel in out i basically mean half days where traveling is the priority  so for that first london date i d be flying in on the 2nd and leaving for liverpool on the morning of the 7th are there any stops on here that are way too long  i don t need to be go go go for every part of this trip  i wouldn t mind relaxing here and there  i tried to build that rest into some of the birmingham time because i figure i ll be a bit worn out by then  and that town is centrally located and low key so i thought it d be good for day trips and rest  again i m alone so i m really just into museums and nature and wandering around i plan on using trains to get around for the most part  though i have be aware that renting a car may be easier for an american than i originally thought  so we ll see on that does anything stick out as red flags on this trip  i m really just looking for general thoughts and reactions from seasoned travelers  i appreciate any feedback  obviously  this is all covid contingent  so here s hoping that the vaccine distribution is successful across the world edit  thanks so much for all of the advice so far  it sounds like the consensus is for sure that it is too city heavy right now and that i should lean more towards smaller towns and countrysides  i think i am going to take that to heart for sure  the other advice is that ireland and northern ireland are worth doing separately and i think i am starting to agree with that  also i m impressed only one person corrected that dublin is not in the uk haha  i know that but looking at the map it made for an easy loop around  i understand it s a whole different place though i m starting to think that i will reduce the number of nights in the cities and do some research on specific spots across the mainland that would be a bit smallemore nature focused  i m also thinking that if this does go on to be the first leg in a greater european trip  maybe i can round out the trip in ireland at the end and spend more time outside of its cities i really appreciate all of the advice  this has been so helpful so far ,0

how to you keep from getting exhausted ,disclaimer  i m fairly new to solo traveling  so maybe my experience isn t thaton on my last trip  i traveled to a city that had so much to see and do that i was  constantly  on the move  every minute of the day   because of that  i was exhausted by each evening  and having only a few drinks at the hostel just sent me to bed right as everyone was getting ready to go out or the night was starting   i felt like i missed out on half the experience of traveling  which is making friendships and connections with fellow travelers has anyone else experienced this   how do you prevent it ,0
learning a language while traveling,have any of you had any luck learning a language by moving to a new country for about a year  i really want to learn spanish but my accent doesn t help and it doesn t help that the country i live in doesn t speak spanish  i m seriously considering moving to south america for about a year in hopes of learning  but moving alone and not knowing the language feels daunting  i ve solo traveled countless times but english was known enough in the countries i ve been to that i ve been able to get by on that alone  this is also something i m planning for in the future  hopefully once covid slows down so i can visit other countries cities while i m out there  so any tips on preparing before the move would be helpful as well  i know a good amount of vocabulary but struggle with listening speaking sentence structure  i ve considered argentina and chile the most  but am afraid that the big cities i have in mind will still speak a fair amount of english and counter my whole reason for the move  i live in europe and have considered doing a month or two long course in spain but honestly think south america would be a better adventure  what do you think ,0
how i can meet people while solo traveling north america ,since march  i haven t left my house  the only people i have had any in person social interaction with are my immediate family members  i am taking a gap year before beginning college next year  i can t leave my house because i have to take care of a parent who has a condition whereby getting covid can be very dangerous  by april or may i can leave because my dad is gonnae back from abroad  i can feel that my social abilities are bing weaker  i feel awkward even when talking to friends on zoom i was planning to backpack south america around may july  but i realized that most international borders may still be closed to tourists and there would be many restrictions  now i am planning to take amtraks to different parts of north america  i am not planning to camp or do any wilderness related traveling  how can i meet people while doing so  where should i go  what should i do specifically  i would like to interact with lots of people so that i can practice social skills  lose any awkwardness i feel now  and regain whatever i lost during this period  in europe or certain parts of south america  hostels are popular which is a good way to interact with people  is there any equivalent in america ,0

when should we be planning for post covid world travel , sorry if this has been discussed endlessly already  but search yielded little results with many vaccines about to be distributed  when should we realistically expect to be able to travel freely and enjoy the world unfettered by masks and restrictions  europe  se asia  and south america may have different timelines i m hoping for the best  but planning for the worst  the bankers  goldman sachs  announced they believe 70  of the developed world will be vaccinated by fall 2021 considering realistic expectations  i d wager that it s really not until 2022 that we have a return to normal  assuming no surprises  regionally 2021 will be better for everyone  but international travel may still be restricted  or at a minimum you d still encounter covid related obstacles around the world i m reconsidering my plan to quit my job in spring 2021 and travel  may need to wait thoughts ,0

tried to do a local trip by myself,i feel like it was a fail cause i ended up chickening out  basically i booked this airbnb which wasn t far from where i live to go hiking by myself  when i got there it was like middle of nowhere and tbh i was immediately ufortable because there were a bunch of white supremacists signs on a few peoples homes in the area  but since i already paid for everything i decided to stay  the airbnb was pretty nice and relaxing with a view of the lake  then i went out to the hiking trail  i kinda got lost and my car was not suitable for the terrain so i had to leave it  i started walking to the trail it was bright and sunny but a little cold  i did see a few older people on the trail  for some reason i felt really ufortable being alone  i just couldn t do it and turned back  i went back to the airbnb  basically i ordered food got some wine  watched home alone and went to sleep  the next morning i left my trip early and went home  i don t know why but i just was feeling really sad  i ve always wanted to do this and it just didn t work out  i ve always went on trips with people  family  friends  former partners  etc  this was supposed to be my first solo trip and it just sucked  my anxiety  depression and stuff since my breakup really messed with my head i m gonna try again and research better next time  but anyway  i know this wasn t really traveling since it was only a short road trip away edit  thank you to everyone for the support  really makes me feel better about the whole situation  i forgot to mention the dog at the airbnb  he was super adorable and a really large dog  it also made my day,0

travellers on capitalism,i m a 24 year old male from canada and i feel as though i have no direction in life  this might not be the right subreddit to talk about this but i feel travelers have a great perspective on life  i m currently working and the job by all accounts is fine  but i m starting to get into the 9 5 grind and i m not excited about the prospect of doing this for the next 40 years  i ve been thinking about on moving to a larger city maybe doing a program overseas like jet before covid  but with it hase a delay which has left me a lot of time for contemplation  i have a good career trajectory but i feel as though i ve been on the rollercoaster of life without much of my own say in the matter and now here i am  i can continue down this path and live a life offort and stability  which i can build upon with family and friends and no doubt will i be happy  as i understand these are luxuries are not provided to all who walk this world but there s still a part of me that yearns for something different  i think thises from my past of traveling doing three separate solo travel trips  these trips have certainly impacted my life and made me less reliant on physical items for happiness and more on experiences which goes against the capitalist system that we as humans are forced to live within  so i guess my questions lies there  i assume most travellers live with the ideology of experiences over materialism  but how are we to cope with life when reality by all accounts forces us down a path of capitalism and conformity  tl dr   what s your perspective on life within the lens of capitalism and the things you ve learned from travelling ,0

what s an european country or city to travel to that doesn t feel like europe ,considering corona is probably easing up with the rollout of vaccines within the next few months  what would be a good european country or city to visit alone  that doesn t feel like you re still in europe  been in sweden  swede so duh  copenhagen  paris  london  brussels  gdansk and warsaw  rome  naples and pisa  athens  vienna and zagreb but i always feel like i m still in europe   it d be nice to not have that feeling if that makes sense  like when traveling to the us and you see the skyscrapers and realise you re actually abroad for example  due to economical reasons and just wanting a quick get away i don t think i ll want to go further than europe once travel restrictions go away  at first anyway  in case someone wonders why it has to be in europe thanks beforehand for any answers and have a nice day  ,0
have you ever taken a solo photoshoot while travelling , i think that one of the worst parts of solo travel  is being stuck with selfies nowadays though there are many websites like airbnb where you can book a photoshoot in the place you re travelling to  have you ever taken one  i hate looking back on a trip and not have a  decent   pic to show my family or friends most of the time i ve take them on a tripod with a self timer and they turn out okay  but i don t always feel safe to do so  it s always a risk putting your phone or expensive camera on a tripod and stand far away from it to take a picture  anybody could snatch it off in a matter of seconds and photos taken by strangers  well they are just not it  amp x200b so have you ever taken a solo photoshoot  would you  or it s something you re not interested in ,0

was chris mccandless  into the wild  trip dumb or dishonest ,i was listening to a podcast the other day about the movie into the wild  it s in spanish but it s very good  its called  cartelera semanal   hacia rutas salvajes  and they talked about that  even if the film was good  the way the protagonist  chris mccandless   alexander supertramp  planned everything was very dumb since he cared too little about himself  and if he cared or even thought a little more he could have survived  i can t remember the exact words right now  if you speak spanish you should check it out  and in fact was disrespectful to mother nature  also they say that their trip was dishonest since he really did have nothing to lose because of his socioeconomic situation  but i want to hear your thoughts about it  was his very badly planned  was his trip dishonest spanish and english answers are wee,0
social versus safety when traveling ,i ve been reading all these posts about people who go solo travel  meet some cool new people  go out drinking and all that stuff  the question that s been nagging at me throughout my solo traveling experiences is  how do you all balance this with safety  i know of somebody who went traveling  made some new friends  went out drinking with them   and woke up in a gutter with all their stuff stolen and had to get an emergency passport back to the us personally when i solo travel  i pretty much have eyes in the back of my head  i do not trust random strangers who are inviting me to go check something out  and don t really care to get inebriated  because if i get drunk and in a bad situation  there s no one toe save me  also i m relatively lightweight at the same time  i feel like i ve missed out on a lot of potential awesome times because of this  where do you all draw the line   when do you go out and party with strangers  and when do you stay safe ,0

starting van or camper travel late in life ,ok  so i ve never done either  lots of tent camping as a kid  a few summer road trips sleeping in my car   i m planning a cross county trip this winter  right now the plan is motel 6 every night  i m wondering if i could pull it together to get a vehicle i can sleep in   i plan to be on the road or visiting family for at least a month  so having a portable place to sleep is appealing to me  weighing the cost of a used van  camper and its gasoline vs hotels every night  my issue is really not so much the cost so much as can i do it  i m middle aged  short  not especially strong  don t think i manage a diy van conversion  i think about struggling to hitch a camper to a tow  i think about a driveable rv  no towing  but that could lead to auto repair issues on the road  please any experiences with buying and using a van or camper  what to shop for  pitfalls to avoid   thanks ,0
your dumbest mistake while solotravelling ,while we shouldn t be out travelling during the pandemic so what s there to do other than sharing our brainbloopers and learning from them perhaps i ve shared this mistake in another thread with similar theme  but oh what a costly error of thinking  i was finally travelling home from southeast asia after spending a month in vietnam  i didn t book a flight home as i had no specific deadline other than a loosely set date  browsed the web on my phone  found a reasonable price   a bit late in the night 00 10  but to save money i m no stranger to travelling late  can even sleep on the flight so not even a bad choice after all so here s the fuck up  i booked the flight home for 25th of june  00 10  not optimal with checkout times but i figured i would just travel a day early to get closer to the airport  check into a cheap hostel  so i did  checked out from the hotel and booked a taxi to the hostel  had a day to rest out and do literally nothing  i arrived at the airport the 25th of june around 21 50  ready for a long flight made my way to the lists of flights and gates that s continously updated  stood there like a dumb fuck staring  looking for my flight for atleast 5 minutes  waiting to see if the rolling list was just playing a trick on my mind  making me miss my specific flight eventually when looking down at my phone and checking my flight reservation i realized i had missed my fucking flight  it s about to hit 26th of june 00 10  not only did i miss it  but i missed it by an entire day after sighing internally and declaring myself dumb for another solid 5 minute which felt like an hour i quickly began looking up new flights  instead of paying 550 euros back home i m now paying 700 euro  and not until the day after  but i m a belief of the you live and you learn  plus i m not by any means rich but i m not poor either so i always budget for major fucks up like this even if it did sting like a bitch tl dr  booked flight for 25th of june 00 10  thought this meant i could go to the airport the 25hth of june close to midnight and make my flight but obviously it s about to be 26th of june so what are some of your brainbloopers fuck ups that ended up costing your pride or economically ,0
taking a pet with you while going abroad,hi  i m a senior in college and i recently found a stray cat and really want to keep him  the only thing stopping me is that i m hoping to take a gap year abroad next year  specifically i applied to a program in spain  i m not planning on traveling to a new country every week or anything  i would have a full time job in spain  but i would likely take weekend trips or maybe the occasional one week trip somewhere  i would take him abroad with me if possible but i m not sure howplicated that is  has anyone done this  and what was your experience like  was it difficult for you and your pet to travel and adjust to a new country or was it relatively simple  would you rend someone taking their pet with them i really love this cat and if i was going to grad school or getting a full time job next year i would keep him for sure  i don t want to give him up just because i might go abroad for a year  so hearing other people s experiences would be super helpful  thanks ,0
footwear for central asia  caucasus,hi all as the title suggests  i m planning a trip to central asia and the caucasus for the future as i would be in the regions in spring  from march   june  that precipitates the need for good footwear  i have a pair of eccos for walking and cities  but need a second option  deciding between a hiking shoe  trail runner  and sneaker  obviously all have their own plaudits  but my main concern is use outside of the mountains and grinding down the logs on asphalt or concrete  that said  if much of the land is going to be gravel  mud  or glass  it would be better to have more stable footwear has anyone spent time in either region and can rend a direction thanks ,0

am i the only one who does little to no research before traveling somewhere ,i mean yes i do a little research obviously on the places  kind of just enough to get me started but other than that i just wing it amp x200b why amp x200b well first off i did this when i was long term traveling so i didn t have to have a strict schedule but for me it was kind of like going in blind makes it 20 times more fun  you have no clue what to expect  which is exciting  i kind of feel like if i do a lot of research  i m watching the end of the movie and then when i get there is start the movie from the beginning i roll up to the hostel and say tell me what to do  give me some tips  what s your favorite spots  and then from there ask them where i should head to next yes  this does end up being more expensive  a harder learning experience but that s the fun in it  those tips on  10 things i wish i knew before going   nope i skip out on  i learn the hard way  and those bumps in the road make it more memorable amp x200b am i the only one here ,0
the pandemic is kind of like a travel  tolerance break  anyone else feel they got an interestingly positive perspective reset ,well here s my rant for the month  not really a question  i fucking hate this pandemic  and i hate being stuck domestic  but there s a tiny silver lining for me anyway  about a year ago   i took my first solo trip and never looked back on whether or not i d like the idea  i was less than a year into really moving on from domestic travel  been to most cool cities in the us  to primarily going abroad  i did as many countries in 2019 as i had in my life prior  i had a cushy remote job  which meant workations on top of good salary and paid vacations  then 2 days before i am supposed to leave for colombia  borders shut down  slowly but surely i started forgetting  or bing a bit numb to  what i loved about travel and why  i got used to not seeing and hopping on flight deals i find just because  the unknowns of solo travel started to be nerve wracking again when i contemplated future trips   but  distance does make the heart grow fonder  as i look at my potential future journeys  i m looking upon them less methodically  with a fresh set of eyes  a new sense of adventure  and in a way rediscovering why i want to see the world  it s not often that i get to reset that bewilderment and innocence of doing something new that i end up loving  the pandemic hitting right as i started to be semi nomadic did give me a minute to evaluate and experience that again  it is kind of a cool feeling  to be honest  but also  still  fuck this pandemic ,0
can we talk about all the travel vloggers in mexico ,i am curious on your opinion of the exodus of travel vloggers who have  moved  to tulum and the yucatan during a global pandemic is this acceptable  it has be painful to watch some of my previously favourite travel vloggers living like life is bliss under the veil of ignorance that has be tulum right now i understand these individuals live this lifestyle as a livelihood   but i am curious if this is seen as acceptable behaviour by this sub maybe i am just envious  man i miss travel ,0

any sites that give a numerical rating to travel destinations   i e  7 5 10 ,are there any sites that give a numerical rating to travel destinations  like 4 3 5 or 7 5 10 imdb does this for movies  and goodreads does this for books  it s very helpful in deciding what to watch or read i was hoping to find something similar for travel destinations  specifically stockholm  toronto  indonesia  and singapore  to determine which trip to prioritize after covid  however  tripadvisor doesn t seem to have this kind of general rating  just rankings for specific sights anyone know of anything like this ,0
is it still possible to travel from continent to continent by cargo ship ,reading the books of such authors as jack kerouac or gary snyder  two huge solo travel heroes of mine  it seems that traveling from  say  europe to india by cargo ship is an incredibly cool way to do it  you have days and weeks all for yourself  all that ocean around you  time to think and reflect etc  so now i am wondering  is it nowadays still possible to kind of  hop  on a cargo ship  not illegally i mean   and also not through sites like this one   where you have to pay 3 000 dollars or more   i am looking for something very basic and affordable  i don t need a nice cabin  i am happy to sleep in a dorm with the sailors  for example   also i guess that in these days of highly optimized crews  it is not possible anymore to just show up by the docks and offer to peel potatoes in exchange for a trip from port said to hong kong  like you could do 50 years ago does anybody have any info on this  any relevant links  or maybe even some experience ,0
feeling like there are so many places to go and not enough time,this thread is just to get these feelings off my chest  there s no real question or point i love making lists of places i want to go  i love creating rough plans  writing down all the activies i want to do and the cities i want to see  i think about the food i want to eat  maybe i ll do a workaway on a vineyard  maybe i ll get scuba certified or do a silent meditation retreat  i love art museums  there are so many hikes around the world i want to do  i would love to go to every national park  i live in the us  most of the individual trips would be 3 weeks to a month minimum to really immerse myself and do all these things that i want to do i get a rush when making these lists but then after i feel kinda sad  i m turning 27 tomorrow  it s like time slips by so fast  obviously with covid i couldn t travel out of the country even if i wanted to  but still  i feel the pressure to constantly work  will i ever have that amount of time off  what are the chances of it being every year  i wish i had started traveling when i was younger when i had summers off  the thought of the years going by and not doing these things makes me feel empty  not much else to say but thanks for letting me vent  none of my friends are very interested in traveling  totally fine  i don t mind going solo  so i appreciate thisunity ,0

anyone ever take a 1 2 week in person  not virtual  course while solo traveling ,curious if anyone s had experience with a short term course workshop during their travels   i know they have  intensive courses  for spanish in central america and i m sure also in the rest of the spanish speaking world which is something i d be interested in doing   are there other types of classes available  photography  cooking  maybe even something technical like programming  available in a short format i d love to hear whether people were able to make friends with other travelers  if they thought it was worth the time investment  after all  it would be taking away time from typical travelling activities  worth the money  etc ,0
how do my fellow solo travelling americans make the most out of their two weeks ,how do my fellow solo traveling americans make the most out of their depressingly short paid vacation time  i guess this really only applies for full time non remote  i had a job that gave me two weeks paid  had nearly 3 weeks when i lost my job  and i could take up to two weeks unpaid off  i planned out my first long solo travel trip for two weeks in portugal for this may  obviously  this did not happen  unfortunately  i was laid off in august and will have to start back at square one with the traditional two weeks  very fewpanies have the unpaid time off policy  in a dream world after loosing my job i would have packed a bag and wandered off with my savings to explore  but i digress  so what tips do you have for maximizing those two weeks ,0
hitchhiking and traveling the world wearing a superhero outfit ,i think it would make things a little more fun and interesting  opening up lots of opportunities with locals etc i have thoughts on how it would be in the usa and europe and don t think i d have to worry to much about my safety but what about central and south america   west asia   africa other thoughts on the whole idea ,0
where in central south america would you like to spend a few months ,for my next travel experience post covid  i want to go one town city for a few months to immerse myself in the local and expat culture  perhaps take spanish lessons  learn to surf  hiking  work away  anything to have a bit of meaning throughout the days  i did something like this a few years ago in antigua  guatemala and it was one of the best experiences of my life  what i do isn t so much important as the vibe of the place  i like to do a lot of things    i think latin america is my goal but open to other suggestions ,0

ukraine 2020,i wanted to share my experience traveling to ukraine   i choose the country because it was open to international travelers and it was somewhere that i wouldn t normally consider   there is an obvious language barrier   at least in most other places in europe they use a latin alphabet which makes things easy   i found that most young people spoke passible english  there is always google translate   ukraine had resisted covid related restrictions and just recently started to require that businesses close down at 10pm   some establishments are closed not because of covid specifically but because of the economic impact of the virus on consumer spending   for obvious reasons the summer is the best time to visit the country   the sunny weather allows for activities on the beach of the river dniepednipro   i arrived for only a couple weeks of mild weather before things got chilly   i got by well with a heavy thermal base layer and a sweater   then i bought a packable puffer jacket on amazon   thebo works well   the alternative would be to invest in a fancy canadagoose style jacket   being from a warm climate i did not think that be a wise investment since i wouldn t get much use out of the heavy coat   kyiv and lviv are amazing cities   kyiv is the capital and the nexus of the country s airline network   lviv is a quaint city with a very european atmosphere   a lot of locals think of lviv as boring since it is such a small area but i found it to be very walkable  you can get to most places in the city center within a 15 walk   uber in ukraine is cheap   my most expensive fare was  13 for 50 minute trip from the airport in kyiv   before the advent of uber i had previously spent  100 to get to the airport in some n  american cities there are plenty of excellent restaurant options in both kyiv and lviv   tinder dates are the best way to experience the dining scene   because of logisticalplications seafood in ukraine tends to be subpar   i think when you freeze a good tuna steak it tends to loose a lot of flavor   also there is a peculiar ukrainian style of putting cream cheese on sushi   they often call it a philadelphia roll   i prefer my sushi with just sashimi and rice  but that is the local take on sushi   i prefer to engage with the locals rather than expats you find in the popular tourist places   i told my dinner date how she spoke english very well   she smiled and reminded me that  english is an international language and you do not own it   i thought that was a very succinct way of putting it   the people i meet in ukraine where pleasant and made for interesting conversation    the thing i disliked about ukraine is that you are unable to drink water from the tap   have you ever been stupid hungover from a night of heavy vodka drinking only to find yourself without any water   it is a real hassle to have to lace up your boots and layer up with many articles of clothing only to stumble to the store and buy a few liters of water   i am glad that i travelled to ukraine   i would not normally consider it as a tourist destination   i have heard good things about georgia from many of the locals   i am now considering flights to tiblisi when their borders open ,0

is the remote pacific worthwhile as a travel destination ,like countries like nauru  palau  micronesia  marshall islands  etc i ve never been to the pacific  and i think it would be neat to visit several countries in the region  i ve heard some people say that it s an unforgettable and one of a kind experience to visit these nations  and others have said it was just too expensive  boring  and that they would have rather been to fiji  bora bora  hawaii  etc instead these nations are some of the least visited in the world  so this may be a long shot  but does anyone have any experiences thoughts on these places  would you visit them again  or should i stick to a more mainstream destination for my first time in the pacific ,0

i m sitting at the airport alone  suddenly feeling really self conscious  help ,let me begin by saying i haven t traveled anywhere in over a year  i ve been working a lot and getting burnt out and felt like i  needed to getaway last week i put in for some time off and booked a flight to cancun  i told my dad and he was a little disappointed about my decision because of the whole covid situation  i told him my itinerary and that he can call me anytime  he told me to enjoy my trip  so i m at the train station and i see this older couple in their late 50s having trouble navigating their way with the signs  they asked me which was the train going to the airport  i told them i was going there too  it turns out they re on the same flight as me  they said they wanted to follow my lead and we talk on the train for a bit on our way there  we get there and check in  i was still getting my ticket and they said they would go to the gate first  i said i d meet them there  i get my ticket and get past the gates  i decide to get something to eat  i see them at the next table but i didn t want to intrude  i just wave and we say hi  afterward  i go and sit near the gate when all of a sudden it hits me   i m all by myself  now i ve always traveled alone  i ve been close to 20 countries all alone  i ve never felt so self conscious as i do right now  it s like you feel lonely and desperate for some type ofpanionship  i m sure i ll meet some awesome people at my hostel like i always do but as for right now  holy shit  this sucks  maybe i jumped the gun  maybe i shouldn t have booked this trip  i really hope someone reads this   ,0
being systematic in choosing next travel destinations,like all of us  i cannot wait to be able to travel again  i approached possible future international travel with a methodological approach i obtained the list of all countries as detailed on  worldometer  using a spreadsheet  i sorted out countries i had already visited  then  i used google travel to source flights from a midwest us city  kansas city  to all the locations i had not yet traveled  i mapped them out here   i chose april due to my birthday month  however  i don t anticipate we will be able to travel anywhere by then  although brazil is open now and costs under  1 000 ,0

experiences of black women traveling solo in italy,my first solo trip was a couple years back  i spent three weeks in europe and travelled mostly in france and italy  i loved paris  now  i m a black woman and my friends had told me italy was amazing  specifically the larger cities  i actually expected more racism in paris by reputation  but i never had one bad experience there  i travelled by train from paris to milan and that was the start of the longest ten days of my life  it was a nightmare  seeing as this was my first solo trip and i knew nothing  i had two huge suitcases  i get off the metro at duomo  knowing i could get a taxi to my nearby air bnb  massive mistake  it was july  the sun was beating down full force and empty taxi after empty taxi passed me by as i was flagging them down  at first  i chalked it up to the size of my bags  my youth  anything and everything  after close to an hour   i even left my bags in an alcove so i could just jump in front of the next empty taxi i saw and make them take me   i was standing in front of a traffic light  so they had to stop  i was ignored and batted away   finally  a kind trans person came out of a local business and called me a private taxi  that s the service i used the rest of my time in milan  i never could get a cab just by hailing there  and i didn t have phone service so i couldn t use uber or lyft  i ve never been so aware of my color in all my life  i m a 450 in fenty  cocoa girl and i had long faux locs for traveling convenience  i was staying in a residential area of milan and people would literally stare at me when i walked down the street  a lot of it was racism but some of it was xenophobia against the african immigrants there  when i wore any kind of american paraphernalia i was treated wayyyyyyy better  i moved onto rome quickly  it was better but still awful  i ll just never know what percentage was racial  one night  i went to a ballet at la scala and bumped into some white american tourists  and they told me about how badly they were treated as tourists  some of what they said sounded very familiar  that leg of trip wasn t all bad  i did some great shopping  had the best gelato ever  saw the vatican  enjoyed the eternal city  but i don t know if i ll ever go back  not even for venice or naples  i felt so isolated and unsafe  has anyone experienced this  any suggestions update  wow  i did not expect such a response  i really appreciate everyone s feedback  everyone who explained milan s taxi situation  you helped me see the whole experience from a different angle  i was in paris for two weeks before i went to milan  and i hailed cabs all the time but i was also right down the street from the luxembourg gardens  so i m sure there were an abundance to be had  i stayed in trastevere in rome  so i could walk a lot or take trams and buses  and when i woulde home from attractions  i would automatically use the taxi stands  so i never really put any of that together before about the taxis in milan  i d always wanted to go to italy so badly and i was disappointed when i did  so i m grateful to everyone who suggested ways i could take back the experience or navigate similar situations more safely  i m glad i posted here  the experience was always such a weight on me  i never talked about it with my family because they hadn t wanted me traveling solo anyway and i didn t want to give them any ammunition  i feel like i could give italy a second chance now  but even if i never do  i feel cleansed of the original experience  now that i ve talked out the negative  i can just remember the positive  those beautiful sunsets  those lovely narrow streets  and the best gelato i ve ever had  thanks again for that ,0

renting out a house while travelling,i m currently living with parents  in uk  and considering buying a house and going travelling  the idea is that i would rent out the house while i travel  which should hopefully cancel out the mortgage costs  plus it would mean i have my own place to return to when i get back i have supportive parents who encourage this idea  saying that they will manage the tenants when i m away  however my main concern would be that i struggle to find tenants  or that the mortgage that i pay would be a lot more expensive than the rent i receive from the tenants i want to know if anybody has ever gone through with this strategy and how it turned out  if it s worth the hassle etc ,0

on the difficulty of crossing busy roads without cross walks,i have been pondering  as i have been watching travel videos and planning lovely future tense vacations  where the hardest places to simply cross the road are nothing brings me more stress than a difficult to cross road  it was a deal breaker for me in much of vietnam  as i stood  my entire body hairs upright  bracing to cross several times a day for three weeks  and i would find my nervous system so aggravated by just trying to cross the road that i would spend my nights inside in defeat  i was in ho chi minh city  hanoi  hue  hoi an  and can tho  and other than hoi an  every city was terrifying to cross at many intersections  fastforward to phnom penh  and i loved it  in retrospect i think because i walked the corniche so often  although i once found myself again unable to cross a sea of motorcycles again at rush hour and wound up finally biding time in a store for an hour because i could not figure out how to cross the street   even with locals   without having a sort of sense of nervous collapse i have been to istanbul  a city of 20 million or so  and walked across a freeway once when lost  and did not feel at all anxious  so it s not only the number of people out  but also  how they drive since we can reflect now  and it hase to mind as i watch videos of cairo  where it looks like ho chi minh city all over again but cars  i find myself thinking   i don t want to ever go there  or  i d go straight to luxor  which could not be that bad  nothing could be that bad  right  i d probably stay in giza and ask if i could ride a camel to the pyramids and sphinx  from the hotel  lol i m curious about three things now  1  does anyone else just sometimes avoid traveling to places where they feel anxious about being run over while crossing the street  not because they have unreasonable anxiety issues but because it s just hard  do you find it kind of wrecks your whole day and you wind up trying to take cabs  that s what i did in vietnam  and i am not a big fan of cabs for short distances   i love walking the city streets  2  where does the good people of this subreddit think the world s hardest cities to just cross the streets are  based on personal experience  and why  3   optional    for anyone who has been to either ho chi minh city or hanoi  or similar   and   cairo  or any other egyptian cities  how did theypare  that s a kind of passing curiosity now thanks for your replies  seeking future chill travel which doesn t make my hair stand on end and leave me curled up in a ball in my guesthouse for the rest of the day after a one hour excursion  but moreso  i just have not seen it discussed before  and i can t be the only person who thinks of the world in terms of  streets that seem legit  and  streets that scare mepletely ,0
where to go ,i m 25f and i m super burned out and stress from work  i am looking to travel next year around february  assuming the borders are open already and covid is cancelled  i went to california earlier this year by myself  got a rental and drove to sequoia national park   i really enjoyed my time there  thank goodness i was able to leave the us before my country went lockdown  i m from the philippines btw  i really want to escape the world  cause corporate life is slowly killing me  so maybe a place where it s small and not a lot of people travel to it  a shitty town  some country other people have never even heard of  anywhere in the world is okay  i really like the mountains  but beach is okay  i also don t have much money  so nothing fancy  it s gonna be a solo backpacking trip  i d probably go for a week  oh  preferably somewhere that s kinda safe too  like 4 10 safety is okay since manila is not safe anyways  any ideas  would really appreciate it ,0

useful tip while planning a safari to tanzania,just thought i could share with youse this information one the things you need to know while planning your safari to tanzania  east africa is  time to travel here is the months breakdown which i thought could be helpful for someone to decide when to travel tanzania seasons  january to february  it is normally dry and hot  it is the calving season for the wildebeests so the  wildebeests will be at southern part of serengeti   ndutu area  though february is the only time of the year which is guranteed to see the big herds all together move to south of serengeti for calving  easier to spot wildlife  good time for birds watching since migratory birds are present march  april  amp  may  this is peak of wet season  grasses bes green and beautiful  rains may interfere your trip   parks are less crowded  low rates applies  animals including the wildebeests which are famous for migration are more dispersed june  it is a transitional period from rain season to dry season  grassess be green  the wildebeets start moving from central to north serengeti  migration can be seen in the western corridor of serengeti until july july to october  it is dry season in tanzania  mostly sunny  morning and nights get cold  from august to sept the great heards of wildebeests and zebras move from northern serengeti to maasai mara by crossing mara river   easy to spot animals because grasses will be grazed by hebivores and also most of animals concentrates around waterholes  it is quite crowded around seronera area in serengeti  high season rates applies november to december  it is short rain season though it is still not bad toe  the grasses bes green and beautiful all in all  there is no bad time to visit tanzania  africa beacause each month has it s own uniqueness ,0
being realistic,alright  hear me out  this might be a strange one ever since i ve  20f  been 16 and watched karl watson s hk2ny  a bit of a desire to start travelling has morphed into a true  full blown obsession  i ve done a mass interrailing trip when i finished school  went around italy for 3 weeks last year and had planned for greece this summer but obviously  that didn t go ahead  anyways this obsession has beenpletely tempted by fate due to me being a planner so last christmas i had started planning a trip for 2022  encing 20th july to hit the banana pancake trail  oceania and finishing off in the us with hawaii  san fran and la when i tell you i ve planned it   i have planned it to an inch of its life  yes  i understand the appeal to not booking things for after a month of the travel you have planned but i mean to go to quite a few events before i hit bondi beach on christmas day so i have to keep to a schedule in order to do the things i want to do  so i know where i m going  the dates i ll be there  how i m getting there  how much it would be to get there  the hostel i m staying at  how much the hostel would be per night and per stay with a few activities thrown in and what visa sort documents i need to enter every country when girls say all they wanna do is marry and have babies  this trip for around 10 11 months is all i want to do   and it s all i need to do as well  however  in this context of covid 19  i m trying to remain optimistic but how hopeful would a trip like this be leaving july 2022 and hitting vietnam  cambodia  laos  thailand  malaysia  singapore  australia  new zealand  fiji  and the us would this trip be viable to happen then  we re talking about with all the events going full blast as well  full moon party  christmas and nye on bondi etc  or will i have to postpone it by a year tl dr  have planned the entirety of an 11 month trip to se asia  oceania  and us  would it be responsible viable able to go ahead ,0

will hostel hotel prices be inflated once tourism opens up ,i understand that returning to normality will be a gradual process  there s not going to be a random magical day sometime next year where every country opens it s borders i want to know what people s thoughts are on the hostel prices  once tourism is normal i don t really understand economics and business too well  but from what i guess is that if there are more tourists  then the prices will be higher  simply because the hostels will be able to get away with and still have full bookings also  what about flights ,0
first backpacking trip  balkans rendations,hello  i m an american college student and i recently signed up to spend the fall semester of 2021 in athens  assuming covid is somewhat under control by then  i would love to spend some time in eastern europe in the month or so preceding the trip and was hoping for rendations  my starting point vaguely is to fly into prague and travel from there to vienna and on to belgrade  i would like to spend the bulk of my time in the balkans and was looking for suggestions mostly for serbia and bulgaria  before traveling from sofia for athens  any suggestions for locations hostels would be greatly appreciated  i m primarily interested in seeing some mountains and historical sites  and accessibility by bus or train is a huge plus  first time backpacker with somewhat atrocious language skills so probably not too far off the beaten path ,0

dealing with loneliness while traveling,so i have been in costa rica solo traveling for about a month now  and the feeling of loneliness is really starting to creep in  i am enjoying the trip and there is nowhere else i would rather be for the next 6 months  but i am finding making friends to be really difficult  i have lived in costa rica before when i was little  and i had plenty of friends  but when you are a kid making friends is as easy as just having toys and being a similar age  now i am 18 and i am finding it very difficult to connect with anyone  the local girls  ticas  are not a fond of white girls  so i am having a hard time meeting girls my age  the boys here  ticos  are very pushy and pretty much are only looking for romance because the stereotype is white girls are rich and easy  i am going to be living predominately in the same town for the 6 months  so i am hoping to make a little bit of aunity  but theunity is very tight and very cliquey  there are the resort owners  surfers  hippies  expats and the costa rican locals  but i don t fit into any of them  so i am just wondering how you guys have dealt with loneliness while traveling before  and if you have any tips on how to speed up the friend making process ,0

need advice about touring the west coast south west in us,hi to give some background about myself  i am a brown guy in his late 20s that has been living in the united states for more than 5 years now  using a throwaway account because my some people irl know what my primary reddit account is and i do not want them reading this post due to the culture and the very abusive environment that i was brought up in  i have never been able to have a lot of meaningful relationships  not in my native country and not since i have moved to the united states  which means that i like to travel alone and i mostly keep to myself  you maybe wondering what that has to do with my post on this sub  but i m getting to it one of the very few people that i can say that truly always had my best interests at their heart and have always supported me to the best of their abilities  and financially supported me when i had to move to the us  lives back in my native country  that person is going through some pretty serious health issues right now and they need someone to support them  i couldn t just leave them to their devices in these tough times  so i have made the very hard decision to move back home to support them  i have already put in my notice at my current job  which ends in 3 weeks  and since i am here on an employment based visa right now  i have 2 months to leave the us and would ideally like to leave around the new year s day i have spent most of my time in the united states working and traveling in the south and the east coast and i feel that i have explored as many places as i could in these parts of the us  so there are no regrets there  but one significant regret i have is that i ve never really had the chance to  explore much of the west coast or the south west  besides a trip to vegas where i unfortunately spent most of my time on the strip in the casinos  so i would really like to visit these places before the end of this year  my budget is up to  7000  for motels and rental cars  but i am not entirely sure on what places i should visit and where i should start and end my trip and where i would stay if i were to make this trip  and how suitable the weather conditions are  i ve always found the pics with nothing but the desert on both sides of the road in nevada and arizona highly fascinating and have always wanted to drive around on those roads  i also have a motorcycle license and would love to ride on those roads but i am not sure if it is as easy to get a motorcycle rental as it is to get a car rental  and how safe expensive it would be assuming that i have 4 days off for the thanksgiving weekend and 3 weeks between the 11th of december   1st of january  what places would you rend if i want to travel the west coast and the south west alone  i have heard that the drive from oregon   california is very beautiful and is adjacent to a beach  so i would like to cover too that if possible  i would also like to make a trip to the grand canyon but i don t know if this is the right season for that  i am feeling even more clueless than i would have in normal times due to the pandemic and the potential lockdown in california  so any advice you would have for me that would help me in doing one or more of the following things would be highly appreciated 1  ride a motorcycle drive a car around in nevada arizona desert area2  make the beautiful drive from oregon   california3  visit the grand canyon4  stops at any other national parks places with amazing viewsi apologize for any incorrect assumptions i made in this post  i have mostly relied upon what people have told me and what i found on some blogs to form my opinion about the places i mentioned above  so i could be wrong in some cases  i am not sure if i will get the chance to visit the united states again  so i would like to make the most of what little time i have left here and visit as much of the western part of this country as i can before i leave  thank you for taking the time to read this far into the post  edit  thank you very much to everyone who responded  i ve had a crazy week and didn t have the time to respond but i really appreciate all the info that i gathered from the answers  have a great holiday season all ,0
advice  amp  information for camino de santiago pilgrimage,hello everyone in this post i m asking your help preparing for my first long term solo travel  as the title says  on the pilgrimage called camino de santiago i m searching for information about the pilgrimage  what to bring  what is useful  what is less useful and any other kind of tips  tricks  etc i m planning to go around april may  if the covid situation permits  and until then i wish to buy more equipment  i have a bivy sack but i think i ll go for a one person tent for example  so please  if anyone has any tips for the pilgrimage and on solo travelling as well  i m really eager and thankful to read it any resource and information about equipment  roads  maps  websites  etc  is wee as well thank you very much and take care of yourselves ,0
if you were a betting redditor  based off of everything we know with the iing vaccines  how long it could take for global immunity  enough for travel to be safe again anyway  when would you guess that we ll be able to safely and freely solo travel again , tl dr the title  essentially i wanted to discuss with fellow solo travelers who i feel must ve had this thoughte up  last year i graduated and got a job in january thates with 2 weeks  80 hours  pto  as a result i immediately started to plan my next trip for march april 2021 so i could revisit japan  and a few other countries  during cherry blossom season  then covid hit and destroyed that dream  however i still want to travel the moment covid is a thing in the past  i m so starved for traveling that i started willingly started working extra hours during certain holidays  like indigenous peoples  day  when we would otherwise have off to acquirep time so i could have 3 3 5 weeks of vacation when covid ends and really make up for lost time now here s where the questiones from  my job doesn t let me rollover pto  so as a result i need to take some soon  i made an excel sheet where i put in a planned date to determine how many pto hours i can use prior to that date to avoid not accumulating pto but still reach max pto by the time it s travel time  example  if i take off 2 days in december  i will max back out around april  and 4 days means i ll max back out in june  give or take as a result i ve been doing some kind of pre planning and guessing on when travel will be back to normal  as wishful thinking as it would be  i don t think march april would be back to normal  which saddens me as i really want to see the cherry blossoms  but i m also a hypochondriac so it wouldn t even be a fun trip for that reason  so i currently have put june as my more somewhat realistic date  of course if that doesn t appear to be the case  i ll just adjust accordingly in regards to my pto and such with that in mind  if you were to make a guess  what month  god forbid year  would you think the world would be ready for risk free travel again  i m just curious on what other solo travelers specifically think  because i feel like y all may better understand the reasons why i m so starved to travel again  doing whatever i want  getting away from it all  making new friends  with no responsibility for anyone else but yourself  you could say i m having withdrawals  my friends generally travel with family and other friends so they don t really understand the sense of pure freedom that i miss so much  thanks in advance ,0
first solo trip   across the us,hey guys  i m  22 f  sure a question along this vein has been asked before  but i wanted to get other people s opinions  i m graduating this december and i am planning on moving to berlin next august for my masters  this gives me a pretty large amount of free time  i ve saved up quite a bit of money  and wanted to do a road trip across the us before i leave  i don t have anyone that could really do it with me  and i plan on probably sleeping in my car for a lot of it  my back windows are tinted in my honda crv  my dad is very against it  is saying that a lot of things could go wrong  i ve traveled a lot around the world but usually with said dad  and i ve never done a trip by myself  there are so many things i want to see before i leave  and although i m quite independent  i have never had to deal with things that can go wrong on the road  like car trouble  etc  i am also worried about the concept of being a young woman traveling alone  opinions on any of this ,0

advice on how to get money in ghana ,hey guys  this is probably a stupid question but i have no idea how money transaction works abroad because i have never travelled internationally before amp x200b i am planning a trip to ghana in 2021  and am confused on how i will get money over there  i know you can exchange cash at the airport  but i would rather not carry a huge amount of cash on me for safety reasons  i have read that visa cards are the most widely accepted in ghana  does that mean i can just buy like the  100 prepaid visa cards that you can find in walmart and use that  again  i feel like i sound totally dumb  but i really don t understand how this works   amp x200b should i just use cash instead the whole time ,0

solo travelled brazil  oct nov 2020 ,i went on a 2 week trip to brazil from the us from late october and early november  i plan on describing my experience  tips  how i did concerning security  covid  my hostel experience  and any other relevant information background information on myself so you can get an idea of who i am  male  28 years old  average build but with a ny resting bitch face and walking speed gait so i can at times dissuade randoms from talking to me  i have solo travelled previously  first time to brazil and south america  english  native   spanish  native   portuguese  intermediate high  obvious accent  brazil solo travel requirement  i d say intermediate easy  if you ve solo d to mexico  turkey or egypt  you re more than ready  quick notes for the tl dr crew  would i rend  yes  very much so  highly rend    currency conversion  very good  usd is strong  places visited  s o paulo and rio de janeiro  covid  everywhere i went people were very cautious of their surroundings  nearly everyone used a mask  social distancing was hard in some locations but for the most part noticeable measures were taken  unfortunately  much like most of latin america  covid and its outbreaks is highly correlated with one s socioeconomic status  safety  i personally believe everything i read previously on reddit and other places were exaggerated  this is not to say that you shouldn t take the smart skills and tips provided to make the informed and preventative measures  i always placed my iphone 11 max pro  whatever it s called  in my front pocket  or my small should fanny pack thing  always had my money clip in front pocket too   regardless of travelling or not  you should always keep your wallet in your front pocket  i personally never saw anyone get mugged  or felt threatened  i did see some sketchy teens near the historical areas in s o paulo  but you can spot them from afar and they just give off a vibe that they re up to no good  they re not violent though  they re just skulking around  some are clearly high   just keep your eyes peeled for anything sus and always look far ahead to prevent anything  and look like you know where you re going and doing  they know when people aren t from there  but if you look unbothered and stern they won t even approach you  it s a bit easier to keep your distance from people due to covid  if someone doese up and tries to pitch you a sale or something just politely extend your arm and say  n o obrigado   no thanks  in rio i took my phone to the beach despite everyone s caution  i never took it out around the bike lanes  however you can see other brazilians and locals jog up and down the bike lanes with their lastest phones  airpods and other gadgets  i didn t want to tempt that  i would only take my phone out on the shoreline  always after checking my surroundings  if you get a beach seat and beach umbrella from those beach vendors then you can near worry free use your phone and take all the selfies you want  i went to the beach with random hostel people  all brazilians  and we had no issue whatsoever  we would take turns keeping watch on our stuff  we did ask a large group next to us if they could keep an eye on our stuff  they were very willing and even suggested we move our things into the middle of their friend circle so they could properly watch it   amp x200b s o paulo  i did all the major touristy things from wikitravel  youtube videos  and random blogs  hostel  brazilodge hostel and hotel in vila mariana  clean hostel  nice staff  due to covid many young brazilian professionalse and go through there  met many recently graduated professionals  brazilians are very kind and intrigued to meet new people and especially foreigners  this is an upper middle class neighborhood  very clean  very safe  you can see young ladies walk and talk on their phones without worry  teens biking around with their iwatches  and people at night without a worry    metro  extremely efficient  clean  and very safe  the moment people pass the turnstiles people use their phones without a care in the world  on the platform and on the train itself  if you ve been to ny  london or paris than mastering this metro system will take about a whole 10 minutes  i never used the bus  mostly because i hate busses and also because of covid    tinder  safe  never met anyone sus or trying to scam you  love motels in brazil are amazing   50 for 12 hours gets you a pool  jacuzzi  waterfall shower and a free meal  uber  safe  everyone i met was 4 85  rating  they recently implemented new measures to stamp out any creeps and to make solo women feel safer and have easier means to report any scumbags    restaurants  highly rend  rodizio de sushi  omfg best thing ever  never had a bad food experience amp x200b rio  i did take a bit more security measures as most people kept saying it was more dangerous  honestly the ipanema area is very safe  much safer than copacabana in my opinion  but even then i didn t feel like people were being robbed and kidnapped at every corner  walked around with my phone in my pocket and used it freely inside stores  restaurants and cautiously on the street    hostel  mango tree hostel  toilets and showers could be cleaner  but it s worth the money  great place to meet other travellers  friendly people  lots of locals  good amount of foreigners despite covid  the very few other foreigners were also versed travellers    beach  ipanema beach is much better than copacabana  fewer people  less beach vendors  less randos and sus people  all the beach vendors that do approach are polite and aren t harassing  they just quickly pitch their sale and if you politely say  no thanks  or look but say you re no interested in the moment they ll be on their way  don t be dick  they re people just trying to make a living  be nice to them  they re nice to you so it s the least you can do  some actually have good stuff  the beach seats and umbrella are about r 30 for both for unlimited amount of time  settle on price prior to sitting  public transport  i didn t ride any  the uber s were cheap enough  i did walk around with another american aimlessly throughout the southern part of rio  no problem whatsoever  pretty chill  safety  i felt as though it was ever so slightly more dodgy than s o paulo but nothing like the fear mongering that many other places would describe it as  i took my phone everywhere  to the beach  the streets  on the ubers  to the tourist attractions  etc  i dislike copacabana  100  preferred ipanema beach  the vibe is different more weing lessercial  less tourist trap  more authentic  also on ipanema the vendors are more laid back and slightly cheaper  all of rio is gay friendly  but ipanema has a  spot  for lbgt  people  they may ask you to watch their stuff  it s kind of rule of thumb to watch other people s stuff as they ll watch your stuff too if you ask  scratch my back i ll scratch yours type of thing  i also felt safer taking my phone our and taking photos on ipanema  it s more of a gut feeling  and never ignore your gut tinder  a bit more shallow people  but just as safe  good food  people are always nice too summary  i would definitely go again  thoroughly enjoyed my time  didn t have a single issue  met tons of people  great sushi ,0

suggestions for solo travel to hectic places,after all this covid is done and over with i m planning a big 2 month backpacking trip somewhere but i m not sure where exactly  my last trip was india and i loved the madness everywhere that came with it  so i want to go somewhere cheap next that lacks rules but not too much of a safety risk  i m a 20 year old caucasian  south america is appealing to me because of how you can bounce all over the continent  as well as south eastern asia with vietnam and thailand as possible starting locations  love to hear some suggestions as well as routes as i m planning this to be a longer trip so will be trying to go to multiple countries  also open to unique off beaten destinations like central asia and all the  stans ,0
do you think it is unethical irresponsible to travel in the covid era ,my vacation ising up on november 21st and normally i go to greece for a month to escape the cold of new jersey usa  around this time of the year  but americans can t travel to europe  covid looks like it will last over a year and we have to return to normal life sometime  but by traveling i will likely feel a little guilt  i am thinking of maybe traveling within the usa to warmer areas down south  since i really haven t been around most of the country  i travel alone all the time  so it would be easy for me to avoid other people and i am wondering if traveling alone in a hotel room by myself would be less harmful than staying at home with my family with this whole pandemic i am wondering if it is even ethical or responsible to travel at all  what are your thoughts ,0

nepal open to new trekkers ,hello all i was planning on hiking up to everest base camp this winter  and then covid hit   i ve been patiently waiting for nepal s borders to open back up  and i ve finally been seeing in the news that the country is accepting trekking tourists   many articles make it out to sound as if anyone interested in hike the trails in nepal can obtain a visa now  as long as they follow the strict procedures and measures in place upon arrival  however  i also see that this is only available to those individuals that had previously been granted permits prior to the borders closing earlier in the year   does anyone have experience with entering nepal since these new policies were put in place   can i be granted a permit now and go ,0
month long workation aodations  any feedback ,as usual  all of this is relative to pandemic status next year  but i m lucky enough to make good money working from home with a flexible enough schedule to do workations  i m very attracted to the idea of month long jaunts  basically turns 3 5 weeks yearly of travel into several months  and i m looking to crowd source a few opinions on this i know there are serviced apartments you can rent  especially in places like bangkok  a target of mine  but i really don t think i d have as much fun holed up in an apartment  whereas i can still meet people in a hostel  do some of the long term deals tend to carry over into private rooms in hostels  in anyone s experience  alternative suggestions that meet in the middle this is less of a concern for other itineraries i m thinking about  something like a week each in barceona  madrid  valencia  and morocco  because i know hopping around will be involved  on this note  does anyone have experience with 1 2 week hops between cities while doing it vs  choosing a  home base  and what were some things that might be worth considering between the two ,0
with 14 days  excl travel  do you do prague   another nearby country or stay in the cr ,just doing some tentative research for next summer  covid willing  and strongly considering making prague the next place i hit for solo travel  i ve done years of research and couldn t be more thrilled with the choice i m not the type to hit as many countries as possible just to do it  but 5 7 days in a city  maybe less depending where  is usually enough for me  i have done a big time dive into what to do in the cr and i can t say anything excites me so far  if i m already out there  i m leaning towards making it a prague  vienna budapest munich something like thatbo rather than taking my time to explore the rest of the czech republic i love natural beauty and the small town charm  but i m always more thrilled by a bit of culture shock  food  nightlife  and interesting architecture history am i missing out on some big time hidden gems in the czech republic  i m less concerned about the logistics of country hopping than i am potentially robbing myself by writing off the rest of a sizeable nation while i m there edit  wow guys  thanks so much for all the feedback  few things i ve settled on prague  budapest  and a 3 day stretch between vienna and bratislava in between  how i split that up is tbd  but with that  i can pick and choose how to spend that time and i can do it midweek so i get weekend days in prague and budapest both  also  apparently my wording was ambiguous  prague was never in play for 2 full weeks  my original question was mostly  should i do this apparently popular country hop  or really dig into all the cr has to offer  however  nonetheless  all my questions have been answered and i m more excited now than when i posted    ,0

solo trip to canary islands,hi guys  just wanted to share with you my latest experience in the canary islands  spain   trip length the trip lasted 14 days broken down in this way  4 days tenerife  4 days gran canaria  5 days fuerteventura and 1 day lanzarote  i was hoping to visit the remaining 3 smaller islands but unfortunately i ran our of time  that s a good excuse toe back soon   covid 19 situation i  flew from the uk and there was no quarantine required upon arrival nor negative test certification  i went there in mid october so the situation might have changed in the meantime  however  you are required to download and fill an health control form and obtain your qr code  to show it at the control points upon arrival in spain  also  a temperature check is performed at the airport all shops restaurants bars were open until late in the evening and masks are mandatory both inside and outside  very few tourists everywhere and hotels resorts beaches mostly empty   logistics there are plenty of daily flights from london and i paid  30 only  one way to tenerife  with 2 luggages  the price carrying one luggage only was  12  i also flew from gran canaria to fuerteventura  the flight takes approx  30mins and i paid  20  from tenerife to gran canaria i decided to catch a ferry  the problem is that i booked it only few days in advance and i ended up paying  70 for a 1 40h journey  lesson learnt for the next time once you arrive  the best way to go around is renting a car    you should rent a car at the airport  it s better reserving the car on   where you can find very good deals  be aware that on top of the price you see on the website  you will need to pay the insurance  which is normally around 50 70  for 4 days of renting  you could also choose not to pay for the insurance  but then you will have to pay upfront for a deposit of  1 100  i chose this option in tenerife and i got my deposit back after one week  generally  the roads in tenerife and gran canaria are very good  especially in tenerife where there is a main highway surrounding the teide volcano and the traffic is not crazy at all  fuerteventura is wilder  many roads are not paved so having an insurance is highly rended  renting a car is absolutely the best way to explore the island on your own and i would strongly rend it  also  fuel is super cheap at approx  0 8euliter so a full tank for a small car would not cost more than 50 eur     tenerife  aodation  what to see i stayed in playa de las americas  in the south part of the island  in normal conditions  this would be the party place of the island  with loads of hotels  resorts  bars and restaurants  it s a very clean and beautiful town  however due to covid  it was literally a ghost town  which i totally didn t mind as i was somewhere else exploring every single day  be aware that there are no beaches here  as in the whole island basically  but you could stay in a luxurious 5 star mega pool resort for 60 70  a night  like i did  to be honest this was not the best option for me as i ve never used the pool or the other facilities of the resort and i could have stayed in a much cheaper place  another lesson learnt for the next time  if you want to experience a more vibrant town  probably you should opt staying in santa cruz  the capital  especially if you land in tenerife north airport 1  teide volcano and the surrounding national park  what else  absolutely amazing  plan to stay there a whole day  you can reach 2 500 mt with your own car  then if you want to proceed further  there is a cable car which takes you to 3 500mt  bring a jacket jumper with you as the temperature when i climbed was about 5 7 degrees  tickets to the cable car can be bought online  it costs around 25 eur  normally there are long lines but due to the corona i was barely the only person there 2  santa cruz de tenerife  nice to wander around for few hours  especially if you fancy nice local restaurants  3  national park of anaga  in the north of the island  you can spend here easily the entire day hiking the spectacular mountains  it s rather a green area so the landscape is totally different from the teide national park  be aware that the roads are good but being on the slopes of high mountains it might be a bit overwhelming driving through 4  punta de teno  the most western part of the island  quite difficult to get there  to avoid crowds getting there  the road is closed every day from 10 to 19 and only buses go there in between  there is an amazing lighthouse at the very end of the road which you should reach at sunset to remain astonished by the view  i went there at sunset after 19 with my own car  absolutely worth it 5  vineyards wine tasting close to pueblo de la cruz  actually didn t go there but i heard it s worth a visit  keep this as a back up plan in case you end up having some spare time   gran canaria  aodation  what to see i opted for an hotel in maspalomas  in the south of the island  paid  50 a night with breakfast included  i could have spent lot less also here  but i wanted to befortable gran canaria in my opinion is the less interesting island i ve visited  it s veryercial and apart from the maspalomas dunes  which are stunning  and some hikes  the other parts of the island are not impressive at all  i spent there 4 days but i suggest cutting to 3 days max 1  maspalomas dunes  2  las palmas de gran canaria  the capital city  the city center is buzzling  full of cute bars restaurants    fuerteventura  aodation  what to see in my opinion  the best island in terms of landscapes    i stayed in the north  corralejo  it s a very cute town with lot of restaurants and bars  the north side of the island is well known for its surfing activities  so you will find a lot of surf houses and a  hippy vibe   highly rended  you could also opt to stay in the south in costa calma  which has amazing beaches but when i went there most of the places resorts were closed and it lacked some vibe  not rended  at least nowadays 1  corralejo dunes  it s a natural park where you will find real desert dunes and a long beach to relax 2  el castillo beaches  especially playa de los lagos and playa de la concha where you can use your sun cream a lot  not far from corralejo  go there for the best sunset of the whole island  there is a lighthouse and the scenery is very cool  especially because i brought a drone and i got very cool shots 3  caldern horno  it s a small volcano  you can climb it and get very cool photos4  cofete beach  the most difficult beach to reach  you have to drive a long dirty road but it was probably the best place i have seen in the whole trip  there is a small cemetery on the sand if you get there at sunset it s stunning  be aware that you cannot swim there  the whole western coast of fuerte is not rended to swim because of the strong sea and winds 5  sotavento beach   this is probably the best beach if you want to practice kitesurf windsurf  it s like 5km long  yellow fine sand and turquoise water  amazing 6  playa de esquinzo  the most famous for surfers  it s on the west side so again not the best to swim  but the scenery is stunning especially at sunset 7  all the windmills around the island  there are many and you can make cool shots of them 8  costa calma  this is a resort place  so quite empty  but the best beaches are there  strongly rended if your goals is just to lay under the suni spent only few hours in lanzarote on a day trip from fuerteventura catching a ferry  price 60  with the car  so really cannotent much  however  i managed to drive through the timanfaya national park and it looks like a martian landscape  absolutely unreal  thanks for reading until the very end  i hope you found the info useful and shout if you have any questions ,0

adjusting to  normal life ,hey y all  i m hoping to hear back from some long term travelers  who no longer travel so much  i m sure most solo travelers  especially long term travelers  understand me when i talk about how easy it is to make connections with people while on the road  you go to a hostel  there s a person sitting at a table  you can basically walk up to them  strike a conversation about deep personal things  and within 30 minutes  you and this person feel like you ve known each other your whole lives  and are now planning to hitchhike together to the nearest rainbow gathering sleeping under trees in the same tent because there is a sense of trust  countless times this happens in different variations  it is crazy how many people i found myself thinking  holy shit  we could actually be best friends wtf  because of how personal the conversations were  how loving and accepting and trusting people are while on the road  same with couchsurfing  and hitchhiking  and volunteering  etc etc etc  now to present day  i m starting a seasonal job in the us  it s my first official  legal job where i will have roots for the next 6 months  and i am trying to make friends here  but damn  it has not been easy for me  i m so used to this instant vulnerability with people  and i m so used to just opening up basically immediately to people because of howon place it always has been while moving around  but i don t think that non traveling people respond very well to this sort of instant interaction  i think i might actually frighten them away  my feeling is that it s seen as suspicious  so  i guess what i m asking is  how the hell do i make friends with people in a stable or regular sort of life  the travel way isn t working  so i m not entirely sure  tips for readjusting are appreciated ,0

how to travel with others when solo travel is much preferred  finding balance,how does one plan a hybrid trip with others when the plans changepletely  and go in a different direction than even alternative preferences due to schedule or budget limitations that are not shared i have been speaking with some friends about a trip for some time now but the plan has changed from the original idea due to abination of covid fears  budget and schedule  i feel bad bailing as we ve been talking about this for a while  but our first choice and my alternative preference have both been decided against for a third place which i don t really care for atm as the main draw is not in active season and there is not much culinary excitement which is my primary interest  the others want to travel just to go  anywhere but here  but i am a little more deliberate with my travel  that being said  i find myself at times wanting to be flexible and go on group trips just to go on a group trip but i am finding it difficult toit  also because of fear of being the odd guy out and go against the flow since i prefer solo travel or travel with specific friends that i know we can align well there is still opportunity for me to go solo to my alternative beforehand and meet up with the group at their choice not too far away but the itinerary they are planning is fitting a lot into a short period of time  if i were to arrive after to shorten my participation  it could be difficult to join up with the others physically  and or align energy wise i am having a hard time finding the flexibility within me to join  but i feel bad bailing despite having fair reasons  fellow solo travelers  how do you make hybrid trips like this work  should i be more flexible  visit my alternate choice and meet up after and go along for the ride or do i call that it has gone too far in a different direction and just politely decline  if i were to go all that way to my alternate and not join with the others at their nearby choice  it probably would not be well perceived  so it seems to being down to an all or nothing  tia,0
i have only traveled international twice  both times to japan  i went solo to japan last year  i want to go again but have mixed feelings about my experience going alone,i have been to japan twice    once with a group of 5 friends for two weeks  we went all around japan  tokyo  osaka  nagoya  fuji  kyoto  once solo for two weeks  i just stayed in tokyo and didnt do any day trips for two weeks the first time i went was interesting  i enjoyed being with my friends but most nights we all wanted to do different things  all had different budgets and regardless of what we did one person wasn t satisfied with what we did  overall i did enjoy it though as it was much better with friendsthe 2nd time i went  was solo  i liked this a lot more as i got to see and do whatever i wanted without having to worry what my friends did  this was okay for the first week however towards the end of my trip i did feel rather lonely as i hadn t really made any friends and the majority of things i did was all solo im fairly introverted  i tried using meetup air bnb events to make things interesting but ultimately i got bored very quickly  it also probably didnt help that i chose to stay in tokyo for the whole two weeks and i ended up just going to arcades everyday for the last 3 or 4 days of my trip  this trip was incredibly low budget  i stayed in hostels and ate cheap food as i thought it would be more wise to spend money on activities and experiences rather than food anyhow  i want to go back again next year for the 3rd time  it most likely will be solo again as my close friend circle are relatively poor with money and spending and they wont be willing to spend a few thousand dollars traveling what were some of the things you do when solo traveling to enjoy yourself more thanks ,0

how do you manage work vs  travel ,i m a 22 year old dude and have been working full time for about the last 2  years  i ve been overseas twice  but both times with my family and siblings when i was younger   new zealand when i was like 14 and the us when i was 17  now that i m working full time  i guess i m wondering how most of you manage work and travelling  i really don t want to live with regrets  i already am worried about wasting my youth and getting stuck  and i m really interested in travelling so i really want to solo travel travel with friends while i m young   not that you can t do it when you re older  but i guess it would be a little different do most of you just travel in your annual leave vacation time  do you get a new job and travel when you re between jobs  do you take unpaid leave  do you quit without something else lined up and just worry about it when you get back i m fortunate that i still live at home currently  with very low expenses so it would be easier for me to just quit  but i m still wondering about what all of you amazing people do  i may move out over the next year or two  and want to travel once we get through this whole pandemic thing i don t know what it s called  but i ve heard of people who try to work a couple of years and save  then travel for a bit and repeat  which sounds cool anyway   let me know what you do  any advice  and if there s any good resources i should check out  it would really help me out   thank you ,0

need a home base for 3 4 months in southern hemisphere for winter to escape sad  thinking brazil chile ,looking to move from ny to somewhere in south hemisphere from january 1  gt  april 2020  i ll be working remotely  and can probably move every 30 45 days  i see a lot of airbnbs in major cities going for about  300 600 a month for something nice  not sure if that s b c of covid or if that s regular prices in the winter but it beats paying  1200 a month in the winter here  anyways  my top priorities are  in no specific order  1  need decent internet 2  would like warm beaches 3  safe 4  decent dating prospects  i m thinking santiago  chile  rio  brazil  and sao paulo  brazil are worth visiting for a month each  but i m open to other places as well like colombia but bogota  medellin   amp  cartagena are in the northern hemisphere so maybe i can do colombia in april ,0
anyone else hates a guitarist at the hostel ,i m probably in the minority here  but i can t stand people who play guitar in the hostel   especially those who bring their own  people don t play their music playlist on a bluetooth speaker out in theon area  because that d be rude and inconsiderate  but why is acceptable for people to play the guitar  sometimes they can also sing  so they do  or someone who sings would join in  the solo travellers who bring their own guitar is so baffling to me  it s such a cumbersome instrument to carry across the world  backpacking   and if they re travelling by themselves  staying at hostels  did they bring it for my benefit  i certainly didn t request it  or is it to get a bit of an ego boost ,0

weirdest people you ve met while travelling ,i ll start  sorry in advanced for the long post  it s a doozy  but i ll try to keep it as concise as possible tl dr  i  25m  met and spent an evening with a drunk  creepy middle aged dude from dubai who borderline tried to be my sugar daddy and set me up with his 13 year old daughter back at home  and got upset when i got the fuck outta there i was in phnom penh by myself at a night market and i met a middle aged man from dubai at an ice cream stall  also alone  he seemed friendly  his english was okay  so we talked for a bit and i kindly said goodbye i bumped into him again on the street  he insisted he buy me a beer  sure why not  and i buy him a round to return the favour  he continues trying to buy me beer throughout the night  but i know my limit and won t get pressured to go past it  i get up to a buzz  3 or 4 beers in  and say no more  which he gets slightly upset about throughout the night he would point to young local women around us and give me a creepy smile and laugh  he talked about how the prostitute he hired in thailand stole his money  and how he has to pay for sex but it s free for me because i m young  he says if i ever came to dubai he d pay for everything and he has more than  150k usd in his bank account  he insisted we go to a bar and i be a wingman for him  i say nope to all of this and he said something like e oooon  what s wrong with you  you re young  which he said every time i said no to anything things got really weird when he started talking about his  very beautiful  13 year old daughter and how he would show me more pics of her if i have time to stop by his hotel room  now  i ve never been to dubai and am unfamiliar with the culture  but maybe this is part of it  please correct me if i m wrong  but that s fucked up in most parts of the world  i m not stupid and wasn t going to spend any more time with him past my own amusement  so throughout the evening i had stated many times that i will leave at 10pm  at this point it was 9 30 and i wanted to bounce  he insisted we get food before i leave  fine  last thing with this guy finally after we eat  i say  alright  i gotta go now  he starts acting appalled and gets extremely upset  like i hadn t been saying i needed to leave at 10 all throughout the night  saying things like  you don t want to hang out with me  fine  i buy you food  i do this and that and you still want to leave early  i say  i never asked you to buy me anything  you ve insisted  i ve told you numerous times that i will leave at 10  and i will  he starts guilting me  saying  fine  go then  no don t worry about this meal  i said i d pay for it and i will  and you still want to go  fine  i say  nope i ll pay for my own meal  nice meeting you  see you later  and i got the fuck outta there maybe it was just a typical encounter with a lonely  drunk  creepy middle aged man from dubai  but boy was an encounter with this type of person weird to me so  who have been the weirdest people you ve met hung out with while solo ,0

anyone miss traveling but feel like they don t have it in them anymore ,i feel like the person i was 6 9 years ago waspletely different  i visited 49 countries by the time i was 25 on very little money  all my travel was either hitchhiking lowest cost option transport and couch surfing or hostels  when i look back at some of the things i did  i feel like i m looking at the life of someone else and as much as i get nostalgic and itch to go back  i just can t see myself doing it anymore i don t know if i ve just been conditioned by society from working a lot and saving investing the past few years or what it is  but i can t quite put my finger on it ,0
how critical is it to have a drivers licence ,i want to start traveling  mostly in europe  just me and my dog  but i still don t have a drivers licence because where i m from it s expensive and not really necessary to get around  so i wanted to ask any experienced individuals here if they ever felt like they needed a drivers license on their solo travel edit 1  i served in a military and my dog is an emotional support animal thus i can basically take her anywhere  trains  buses  planes  depends on thepany as long as i notify ahead  and my dog is extremely well trained and it won t be our first time traveling overseas she s not at all a hassle but a truepanion who helps me to cope with various things in my life  ,0
first solo trip   how to cope with massive change in perspective ,before i decided to take this trip  i was veryfortable in life  i had a great job  a good gf  and a routine in life where i branched out of myfort zone once in a while  however  after talking with a couple of close friends and taking lsd  i decided i didn t want a life of constantfort familiarity  i aggressively interviewed for a better job  broke up with my gf  and booked a solo trip to mexico   i jumped in the deep end i just got back from my trip and it was possibly the best experience in my life  where i m from in the us  the culture is heavily based around money status material objects  however  when i was in mexico  i didn t see many luxury cars and mansions  but rather met amazing individuals with strong personalities character  there were quite a few people who pursued creative careers where they got to express themselves  people who i had just met being extremely weing  offering me drinks  suggestions on where to go  and access to anything i wanted  if we partied too hard one night  they offered to look after me  made sure i was having a good time and ultimately being safe  even though the trip was only 2 weeks  by the end of it i felt closer to them than some of my best friends  i m feeling very confused and sad now  because it feels like my worldview and values changed  i felt like i was my authentic self when i was alone in mexico   so much more extroverted  meeting new people everyday  going on dates  and loving life  i felt like i truly had a passion for life and not just chasing the same things people around me are going through motions  now that i m back home in the same place  with the same people  doing the same things  my mindset is reverting back to the old me  it feels like a lot of what i previously valued went out the window and i have more appreciation for exploring new places  meeting likeminded and kindhearted people  and living life to the fullest is this a phase that will eventually pass  while i don t want to be sad anymore  i definitely don t want to crawl back into a life of extremefort ,0
how did you get started in your travels ,as the title asks  how did you guys go about planning and starting your first trip solo i ve been longing to hit the road on my own for a long time but haven t done it yet  unfortunately due to covid now doesn t seem like a good time to get out there but i think it s a good time to plan  i m  26m  in canada  southern ontario to be more precise  i ve got next to no experience travelling so i m really unsure where to even begin  any tips for making that first trip a reality would be greatly appreciated ,0

new name while traveling,does anybody else go by  a  different name s  while they re traveling  i never really liked my full first name or the default shortened version of it  i m from the northeast us and the first vowel is an  a  followed by a double consonant so its already overly nasal  but also since english has like 8 different ways  a  can be pronounced  accents have a huge effect on the way ites out  half the time i feel like i m saying it wrong  i recently left to solo travel around the us doing workaways and seasonal jobs and have been going by a different nickname  one that s still contained in the original  just an isolation of the middle syllable  it s short  sweet  and easy to pronounce and remember  it s taken a minute to adjust to it but honestly it fits well  i feel like a new person  like i m really getting a fresh start no one back home knows i m doing this and i feel like they would laugh  maybe because it seems arbitrary  maybe because the new name is cooler and they think i m trying too hard  maybe because it sounds like it s short for something else entirely  i don t care  i like it if i finish in my first city and decide i don t like how it feels  i still have two or three other nicknames i can extract from my birth name  thanks dad  when i move onto my next place i can always switch it up again and try something new  maybe i ll adopt a slightly different persona based on the nickname and region  who knows  the possibilities are endless  if you guys have ever done something like this  let me know how it turned out for you  is it confusing to keep it all straight  does it always feel like lying  do you find that your personality shifts with the name  i feel like at the very least  this could be a cool social experiment ,0
met someone special  things could be great  2020 thought otherwise  a lesson is learned,so  a little less than a year ago  i ve traveled solo to buenos aires where i stayed for a month  everything was great and became even better during my last week there  when i ve met this cute and quite unconventional girl  she was also a foreigner  a  much more experienced  solo traveler  and she was staying there for a couple of months or so  from the moment i laid my eyes on her i knew she was special  our first encounter confirmed that  i like to believe that she saw something in me as well  we ve spent some relaxing time together  sightseeing  sitting in parks and just talk  taking lunch  etc  but nothing more  knowing that there was only a few days left for me there  and given the fact that i was in a near to end longtime relationship  which i also told her about  any thought of taking things further seemed pointless and inappropriate  also  i wasn t so sure about my actual feelings for her  since i didn t knew her that well yet  saying goodbye was tough  but i remained positive knowing that being in touch  it would give us the opportunity to know each other better and maybe meet again somehow down the road  i thought long story short  came back home  ended my longtime relationship  not the easiest period for me  while messaging with her at an almost daily basis  at the beginning she was very responsive  playful and always so thoughtful  which made me think about her a lot during the days  it was obvious though that she was expecting something more from my part  i let her down  i didn t respond as i should  instead i was trying to be rational and keep things friendly and casual  i also needed to clear my head from my recent  difficult  brake up  there will be a better moment for this  i was thinking that s when i started noticing her initial warm reactions to gradually cool down  this shook me up a little  and made me realize how much i liked her  right before i enter the friend zone  or maybe a little bit after  i decided that  even if it s late and despite knowing that i was risking our still fragile friendship  i had to be more direct with her  and then  covid 19 happened  quarantine imposed  her flight back home canceled and everything else became secondary  i naturally shifted my focus on her safety and tried to be helpful  supportive and a little advisory  when she is back home  safe and relaxed  then we can discuss about anything  the last thing she needs right now  is me writing about pink purple skies and smooth fiery lips  i thought meanwhile  she had previously met and made friends with a local guy  and since she was trying to find a better  to her current miserable  place to stay and reduce costs as well  she apparently accepted his offer to go and stay with him  until her departure  to be fair though  i don t really know if that s the way it happened  only my assumption but again  a couple of days before she was about to fly back home  argentina  only country in the world  banned all inbound and outbound flights for the next 4 5 months  she now was a foreign girl in a foreign country  jobless  and with no other option than to stay there and try to weather this pandemic storm and the uing threatening winter  that s when you realize that  not being able to help someone you care about so much  it s probably the worst feeling ever  i should also mention that i offered some financial help  but her being such a proud  and stubborn  person  didn t want to hear any of that soon  the frequency of her messaging started to drop and after a relatively long period of silence  she came back with a lengthy message stating  among other  that she is ok and that  there s been some  developments  and her up to then roommate is now her boyfriend to be honest  i thought i was prepared for this eventuality  for which i blame none but myself  but it struck me much harder than i could possibly imagine  i ve sent back a relatively  charged  emotional message along with a poem i had written before  where i made clear my feelings for her  i also stated that i understand  and although it might take some time  i will eventually write back since my caring and interest for her was real and above anything else it took more than a month  when i finally sent a long and relatively friendly letter  hoping to at least re establish some basicunication  a few days later  instead of an answer i discovered that i got blocked  for the first time in my life  yeah  such a weird feeling  a big  why  zero answers  and a few uncertain and contradictory assumptions  is all you left with  for the rest of your existence but it s been more than two months now  and during this period the situation in argentina went downhill in multiple ways  so it s difficult for me to stop thinking and worrying about her  they say that time cures everything  and that the best antidote is to just meet new people  i did that  moved on  but to be honest  i still have this bad taste in mouth from how things ended up  more importantly though  i simply miss my once friend and i can only hope that she s ok anyway  this is a lesson learned and at the same time my advice to anyone  especially travelers  if you unexpectedly meet someone truly special for you  make hehim your overall priority  change schedules  forget about others  and let hehim know exactly how you feel  don t wait for the  proper  moment  and as we all know very well by now  tomorrow should never be taken for granted  neither the feelings of another person safe travels to alledit  ok i admit that my reaction was probably a mistake and i can see this more clearly now  but again  it s better to show your annoyance verbally  or written  than not say anything at all  especially when there s the distance factor which leads to many misinterpretations  no matter how cool and smart the other person is ,0
i feel that i m getting toofortable with the 9 5 life  and that it s going to be difficult to long term travel again ,so bit of backstory  i made  this post  about 6 months ago  from that point  i ve found a very well paying job  as well as an incredibly affordable living situation  with the current state of affairs of the world  i am still shooting to leave in late 2021 for a 12 18 month trip around the world what makes me nervous is i m getting toofortable with my 9 5 job life  i am making quite a bit more than i thought i would be  so i m saving 3x more for my trip then i need  i like my job  and really like my relaxing life right now  with the rate i m saving  i could literally pay off all of my student loans within 12 months   given quarantine  i am spending quite a bit more time and money on my home space  and frankly on the year leading up to my initial trip  i was minimalizing my possessions so it would be easier to leave everything behind  i feelfortable hanging out at home all day now  i love to travel but right now my home office feels relaxing amp x200b i want to go on this grand adventure around the world  i want to do something that most people in american society will never have the opportunity to do  i want to see how much a 12  month trip will change me as a person  but i m getting nervous that when the timees to send in my resignation  i won t be able to do it  i had so much energy and excitement to leave in may 2020  but since that didn t happen and i don t know how long it s going to be until i can leave now  i don t know how to target my energy anyone else feeling these vibes edit  as many people are questioning the topic of finances  this is my issue  i literally set up my entire life up until the point where i want to leave to save money   i could have afforded a really nice apartment  instead i m living with 3 room mates  i could afford to treat myself and eat out more  instead i meal prep and shop with coupons  etc  i planned to sell my truck  my motorcycle  about  5000 worth of mechanic tools  etc so money is the last worry in my mind  it s all about personal feelings at this point financial plan at the moment  which will be fully funded by august of 2021  6 months of living expenses in case of unemployment  12 months of everyday travel costs   this factors in not working on the road  day to day expenses  when volunteering working along the way  i can bump this to 14 18 months  18 months of student loan payments for the entire time i m gone  a few thousand in my 401k and roth ira up until the point where i leave  as i want to contribute to that as much as i can in my youth  around 10 000 dollars left over for savings once i get home  as i don t want to bepletely broke savings wise  rolling back into the usa being like  i only have  4  while boarding my plane home is not the way i want to end things so don t worry  i m being financially responsible  edit 2  once again  finances are not the problem  student loans are not the problem  paying off student loans are not a problem or even a concerning thought  with this plan i will have all of my student loans payed off in 4 years or less  please stop saying i m dumb for not paying off student loans immediately and pushing my already delayed trip that was the only thing keeping me sane throughout my graduate program back another 12 months  if i was smart i would drop the  20 000 i have saved for this trip into the stock market instead of blowing it traveling around the world for an entire year  this isn t about the money     edit 3  decided the best way to get out of this slump is to travel more  currently looking at flights for late november for safer locations  possibly camping somewhere or a more distanced holiday  ,0

1 week in peru  may 2021,hey friends  first and foremost  in case you didn t see it  budget air is pushing an aeromexico deal that got me roundtrip from slc gt lim for  267  no idea about other departure hubs  but i d imagine it s not just for slc  so yeah  don t say you weren t told  anywho  i ve got essentially a full week in peru  something like 9 days to pad travel and have an actual  full week  for may of 2021  i have done some decent research and basically came to the idea that i should do a 60 40 or 70 30 ish time split between cusco and lima  with cusco getting more time  of course  i want to see machu picchu  and i do love the outdoors in my own right  i currently live in salt lake  but that will probably be a 1 2 day thing for me  rather than the full 4 5 day inca trail  i am a big fan of hostel life  nightlife  although i like local dives more than clubs  and just generally interesting places to wander  do you think my split is appropriate  i ve heard lima can be underwhelming  and was considering not bothering for more than a full day or so and just heading right over to cusco and surrounding  basically  making it a trip to cusco with a layover in lima   any hostel rendations  general thoughts on the itinerary  etc tl dr possible itinerary travel days excluded   day 1  lima exploration and lots of food  night outday 2  basically the sameday 3  leave for cusco and explore area around my hostelday 4  machu picchu day 5  maybe mp again or more cusco hangsday 6  one of the day trips around cusco day 7  back to lima  hang out until flight the next day  cheers ,0

which was the laxest and strictest border crossing , laxest border crossing   discounting the places without formal border control eg schengen  for me it s the la linea crossing into spain  inside the border post there were a set of automated gates  and a manual counter  i instinctively went to the automated gates  thinking that like a normal border post these would be faster  only to find they are not turned on  only then did i notice everyone was going to the manual counter  i went up and tried to hand over my passport  the official glanced at the cover  didn t even take it  and waved me through   o strictest border crossing macau by far  i got a pat down search by officials before i boarded the ferry  this was even stricter than flying  so i had a feeling things wouldn t be easy and i was right  as soon as i stepped off the ferry  i got taken into a holding room  three or four officials started questioning me  what are you doing here  where did you go before  how much cash i had on me  and can they photograph the cash  what are the names and occupation of my parents  where will i be staying etc etc  they asked to see my travel photos and my social media apps after a round of questioning they took me into a second holding room  with a dozen other people awaiting processing   some of these people were deported while i waited so i was nervous i would be too  after a very nerve wracking hour they finally took me to the immigration counter to have my passport processed  all in all it ended well ,0
debating 3 mexican cities,i m traveling to cdmx for 5 days  i just love cdmx just so much to do but i ve always wanted to visit a  pueblo m gico  i have narrowed it down to 3 cities driving distance away from cdmx  cholula  pueblasan miguel de allende   guanajuato taxco guerrero there s so much hype on san miguel de allende but the videos and seen the only thing that people seem to talk about is about the parroquia that s prominent building there  cholula has the pyramid and all the churches  taxco in my opinion looks more attractive to me just the way the city looks and  feel  it gives off in the videos  has anyone been to all three and which would chose to revisit if you had an option to go back ,0

8 000 miles in 2 weeks,in april of next year  i have to drive to tucson for some work business purposes  so assuming a baseline  i will have to drive to arizona and back at the bare minimum for this trip  i have wanted to do a long solo road trip across the us landscapes for some time  i have enough vacation days to take approximately 10 11 days off on top of 3 4 days for my work in tucson  so assuming that  i will have about 2 weeks to do this trip give or take a few days  my estimates say that just the driving part of this trip will take 120 150 hrs  so i will budget a week for just driving  that leaves me with the other week for my work in tucson and any stops i make  so it will probably be a split of 3 4 days in tucson and 3 4 days of sightseeing in various cities parks across the us for abined total of 7 days of non driving  this trip from end to end will be roughly 8 000 miles  i will be driving to arizona no matter what due to work  but i would like to see more of the western us by road as it is meant to be seen  the longest drive i have done before is tampa el paso tampa so this will be quite a bit longer than that  i am fully aware that this trip will be very tolling on the body  but it should also be the adventure of a lifetime  this will be a solo trip by car with just me and my toyota  any advice on travel tips or what to see along the way is greatly appreciated  i would imagine that the mountainous areas of lake tahoe  colorado and maybe utah would have some snow during mid april when i will be taking this trip  and i plan to take this route having accounted for snow along this route  i only plan to explore dallas  grand canyon  san francisco  lake tahoe  seattle  denver  and detroit  any other stops will be for rest sleep  with that in mind  here is the planned route tampa dallasdallas tucsontucson phoenixphoenix grand canyongrand canyon los angeleslos angeles san franciscosan francisco sacramentosacramento lake tahoelake tahoe portlandportland seattleseattle salt lake citysalt lake city denverdenver kansas citykansas city st louisst louis indianpolisindianpolis detroitdetroit cincinnaticincinnati atlantaatlanta tampa,0

travelling as an air hostesses ,i m a final year university student and after graduation i m looking to travel for around 6 months to a year  i ve saved up a decent sum of money which i think is enough to get me by  i ve recently started looking into working as an air hostess to help with airfare as well as earn whilst travelling  i know that i won t be able to pick where i ll be able to travel to  nor will i have a long time to stay to explore the country  however  i m not really fussed about where i go or for how long has anyone tried to do something similar  or does anyone think that this is not a good plan considering i am only looking to travel for around a year ,0
did anyone struggle with asthma abroad   central south america etc ,i traveled to mexico city a couple of years ago  and upon stepping out of the airport i felt as though it was a struggle to breathe  i only have mild asthma and it s never caused me a big problem to be honest  but as soon as i stepped into mexico city i started to panic  because this sensation of not being able to breathe just wouldn t leave  i remember going to bed and almost gasping for breath  either way  in the 2 weeks i was there  i got used to it eventually but i was never fullyfortable  i can only assume this is because mxc is high above sea level been planning to go through ca sa at some point next year by myself but i notice that many other sa ca cities are high above sea level  across chile  guatemala  peru  ecuador  colombia  and bolivia  are cities with higher sea levels than mxc even without covid right now  it makes me wonder how i will cope in these places  has anyone else with asthma  or like in my case  mild asthma  traveled to these regions  was it a struggle breathing etc ,0
public transport through uk,i m planning a trip to uk  hopefully not so far in the future yet not during these hard days of pandemic  my main target for this trip is to see several places linked with technology and transport which are not so close to each other  for early plans i decided to visit places in west midlands  shropshire  cheshire etc  my biggest issue is how to travel across these counties or through them by the means of public transport  the routes for example like liverpool chester birmingham or some small routes like birmingham bridgnorth  travelling by rail seem to be quite a good pn shorter routes  return on the same day ticket what a great idea  but they start be quite expensive on longer routes at least for my home country standards  if you have any tips for travelling by rail i would really appreciate them  as for other ways like buses i have no idea at all but heard they are cheaper and of course can get you where there s no railway  there are of course car rentpanies which i consider as well  of course that s not public transport  but haven t found any which will allow me to use their cars  i m 21 with driving license for 3 years  of course for in case of places worth visit in earlier mentioned area i will be happy to hear your suggestions both linked with my mentioned interests and not  for now i wish you and  to your loved ones to stay strong and healthy through this hard times ,0
visiting india,i saw some negative experiences from people visiting india  as an indian now living in the us  here are my two cents that i believe will make a trip to india much much better 1  i do not rend visiting the big metropolitan cities  delhi  mumbai  unless you are a foodie  they are unsafe and chaotic and hard to navigate  if you have an indian friend then spend a couple days in one city with them and eat lots of food  if you like clubbing then hit up some clubs  because the indian clubbing experience is unique and lots of fun  but make sure to go with a native friend who has experience  i am from delhi  2  visit the mountains in the north  go trekking  if any of you want rendations on hikingpanies then feel free to dm me 3  visit the south  i highly rend the backwaters in kerala 4  visit rajasthan  a state with incredibly unique culture with everything from architecture  food  music and clothing  but do not visit the big cities like jaipur  they aren t worth it  5  hit up some national parks  i rend kaziranga  gir national park etc  6  the northeast is beautiful and you will never find culture like you find in certain places there  like shillong and nagaland  7  continue on to nepal or bhutan edit  i love the big cities in india  i love the chaos  the architecture  the food  everything  however it can be overwhelming and even dangerous for a solo traveler who doesn t have an indianpanion  i d like to add that as a woman i never go out alone even though i grew up in delhi edit 2  i didn t expect so many people to read this  i d i d known i d have gone into more detail  thank you to all the folks in theents who did that  apologies if some of what i said came off as negative  i was really just trying to respond to people on this sub who described why they didn t like the big cities in earlier threads ,0

best country route for a solo bicycle trip ,i have traveled countries on all continents as a backpacker and i recently  partly thanks to the virus  started riding road bike in my home country  germany  as a hobby and sport so now i am thinking  once it s possible again  tobine the two  but don t really know where to start do any of you have experience doing  also short  city to city  trips in any cool countries  my concerns are mainly about safety  riding through the countryside where probably no other tourists ever are  and about road conditions and geographic circumstances  elevation  rainy seasons   would be happy to hear from your experiences ,0

in need of some encouragement,i have been working for many years to make one of my childhood dreams  to solo travel the world  a possibility  as i get closer to achieving that i am starting to feel insurmountably discouraged  and hoping theunity here can remind me why this is a worthwhile effort in the first place i started school at 20 having worked in retail through the worst of the  08 recession and wanting a better life  i graduated at 25 with  80k in student loan debt  and started working my ass off to have some hope of paying that off so i could travel before i get too old  now at 30  i am actually six months away from being debt free however these 10 years have taken much more of an emotional and physical toll than i wanted  i paid my loans by working my ass off at a very corporate fortune 500pany  moving every year or two to live at our construction sites  my hair is falling out and i am bing increasingly sad every year that i make a group of friends only to leave them behind when i move to the next project  all of my coworkers are very conservative people who have hardly left the usa  let alone as free wheeling solo travelers  so whenever i bring up my dreams i just sound like a crazy child  everybody around me just asks why don t i buy a house  worry about my credit score and 401k  etc i just can t ignore how positive my travel experiences have been  i find myself an infinitely morepassionate  thoughtful  and patient person when i am free on the road  my  fantasy  is to solo travel indefinitely  without any sort of schedule or agenda and understand the world outside of the constructs imposed on us  i would like to redefine my life outside of the confines of the corporate world and the  american dream also i am really not confident i want to live or raise children in the usa  this has been an incredibly difficult place to be a middle class person and i don t want my children to be preyed on by moneyed interests the way i have been  i believe that many places in the world are actually much more  free  and i want to open my eyes to that ,0

me  my dog  and my honda civic  feb may 2021,i work for amazon  totally remote  flexible hours  i relocated to seattle in march 2020 just as everything started to shut down  i ve never stepped foot in the office  i haven t made many friends  and yet i m paying  2000  in rent just to be near a workplace that is still locked down so here is my idea  my lease is up in february 2021  i have plenty of ie  why not pick a few of these  1500 month all inclusive airbnb places around the country while working remote and solo travel from place to place  it would still be cheaper than the rent in seattle if you made it this far  thank you  i d also love some rendations  i m thinking montana  idaho  colorado  etc  being that they are drivable and scenic ,0
to those who have traveled since the pandemic began  was it worth it ,long story short  i have an 8 month gap between now and starting grad school  i have been saving up for the past few years to go traveling but obviously my future plans have been affected by the pandemic  it s an unfortunate situation because i ve been looking forward to this trip for the last few years and don t think i ll have 8 months to do whatever anytime in the near future  but it is what it is and i know this is peanutspared to what others might be going through right now  i m holding off from traveling anytime soon especially since the stuff i like doing  food  nightlife  meeting people  etc  aren t viable right now  but i ve seen consistent travel activity in this sub for the past few months so i m curious what others have experienced ,0
trip report  three trips in new south wales  australia,i usually take an overseas holiday each year  but that s legally prohibited for australians for the foreseeable future due to the pandemic  instead  i made three road trips around the state of new south wales from my home town of canberra over august and september  i m posting a trip report to share my experiences for the interest of other australians trip 1  canberra to dubbo i took two weeks off in august  with plans to spend most of this time in sydney  however  due to a covid outbreak in sydney at the time  the australian capital territory government strongly advised canberrans to avoid the city and holiday in areas of nsw with no covid cases  as a result  i booked a two day trip to the regional city of dubbo  which is best known for being home to the vast western plains zoo  the sister zoo to the famous taronga zoo in sydney  and left the next day this was my first solo road trip anywhere  and i really enjoyed the experience  the drive to dubbo was lengthy  but very scenic  i stopped in at cowra  where i had my first cafe lunch since march and visited the remnants of the world war ii prisoner of war camp  not very interesting  and the japanese cemetery  fascinating i spent almost all of the next day at western plains zoo  which was fantastic  unfortunately due to covid restrictions the keeper talks and animal feeding sessions had been cancelled  but there were good video versions of the keeper talks for about half of the displays  i drove home the next day via parkes  where i visited the famous radio telescope  aka  the dish  and had the largest hamburger i ve ever eaten for lunch overall  this was a fantastic trip  i really wished that i d allocated at least another couple of days to it to visit more of the towns in this region as there was a lot to see trip 2  canberra to wollongong with covid advisories still in place for sydney  i decided to spend some of the next week of my leave in the largest city in the world canberrans were able to freely visit at the time  the coastal city of wollongong   population 300 000 i drove up via the pretty coastal town of kiama  where it s blowhole was in fine form due to heavy seas  i spent the afternoon walking around wollongong s spectacular beach and charmless business district i spent the next morning at the historical aircraft restoration society s facilities at an airport to the south of wollongong  this was much better than i was expecting  as all visitors are given a guided tour  largely for oh amp s reasons  and it had a huge collection of well maintained planes  some of the aircraft visitors are usually able to enter were unavailable due to social distancing restrictions  but i was able to tour their ex qantas boeing 747  after lunch i visited the nan tien temple  which is one of the largest buddhist temples in australia   it was huge  but not terribly interesting this was also a fun trip  two days was about enough though trip 3  canberra to sydney in september the advisory against visiting sydney was eased when case numbers dropped to very low levels  so i took half a week off and headed up there  as canberra hadn t had any covid cases for months and there is almost no use of face masks  with the local government not requiring this in any circumstances  visiting sydney was a novelty in that the nsw government was strongly encouraging people to wear face marks on public transport and other places where maintaining social distancing was difficult i spent much of my time visiting family  but also rattled around the city  take up of face masks seemed to be at around 50  on public transport and lower levels in most other places  several art galleries i visited were very strongly encouraging visitors to wear marks  i wore mine whenever i was in public transport  cramped shops and at other locations where doing so was requested or seemed sensible  the absence of foreign tourists was very noticeable  and depressing  with circular quay and the opera house area being almost deserted in the middle of the day i also enjoyed this trip  the covid restrictions were sensible  and were working well conclusions these three trips really helped me to get my confidence back regarding travelling outside of canberra and eating in cafes and restaurants following our lockdown period  it was possible to enjoy the trips while still following covid safe practices  contingent on covid case numbers remaining very low  i m looking forward to further travel around australia now that most of the internal border restrictions have been eased or removed ,0
my first solo travel experience ,first solo travel experience hey guys i just wanted to chime in and talk about the trip i went on this past weekend  with covid going on it s been a pretty dull year so far but i wanted to try and do something safely  i live in nj and decided to drive to virginia to go camping in the shenandoah valley  while down there i visited the luray caverns which i must say were absolutely beautiful and i fell in love with shenandoah national park  this was the first solo trip i ever went on  on top of that this is the first time i ve ever gone camping too  i d be lying if i said i wasn t anxious and nervous approaching it  i was a little scared that i would end up not liking it and just sucking it up telling people it was great  my experience truly was incredible  i finally understand all the love and hype for solo travel that i ve been looking into for months  i felt so at peace the entire time  it was such a good feeling knowing everything i was doing  was literally what i wanted to do  there were no arguments about what to do or any of the other typical situations with group trips  i m so excited for things to improve in the world so i can travel a little more openly and start this solo travel journey  i love all of your posts in this sub  they truly make me excited for what is out there  also before the negativityes in with traveling during covid  i actually took a rapid test today which came back negative and i am quarantining until my pcr test resultse back reposting because my first post was taken down for adding social media  didn t realize that wasn t allowed ,0
how do you deal with your family back home ,i m sure majority of people here are around the ages of 18 35  some probably even older  i m in my 20s  ande from a family where we are all really close  all my brothers and parents live in the same city and see each other frequently   i solo travelled once  it was for a 2 voluntary day work conference in london  and i decided to stay instead for a week so i can have fun afterwards  i was always interested in being to a new country alone and thought this was the perfect opportunity to start  my parents were very uneasy with me going alone  they wanted my brothers toe with me  my brothers never solo travelled either  only trips they taken were family trips  it was a battlefield trying to convince them that i needed this for work  even though it was voluntary but i made it seem like it was a must  and since my brothers weren t able to just get up ande with me  my parents finally accepted  while i was in london my mom was practically texting me throughout the day and we talked on the phone every night  when i came back my dad told me in secret that that week was the most he s ever seen my mom stressed out  but that he was proud that i got a new city experience lol how do you deal with your family when wanting to go solo travel  are theypletely chill with you doing your own thing  do they always try to talk you out of it  i like to hear your stories ,0

how to plan travel around meeting locals and other travelers ,so i see lots of posts here with folks mentioning things like visiting a new country for  say  a month  and making local friends with whom they still stay in contact  or getting invited into a local s home for tea and dinner  or spending the day with a local  or exploring with other travelers  etc i m wondering how people find themselves in these situations  one of my favorite things when traveling is meeting locals and just hearing about their perspective  i feel like ie away from it with a deeper understanding of the place i just visited i also enjoy meeting fellow travelers for similar reasons  just to learn about their experiences and  i suppose  expose myself to a more diverse array of people than i would meet here in the us the problem with me is i m fairly introverted  i m not shy per se  and will try to strike up others in a hostel  for example  but if i sense a cold reception on their part then i get discouraged and withdraw  not wanting to bother them on top of this  i usually plan my day around visiting cool landmarks  sites  restaurants  etc  but this activity isn t super conductive to meeting others  because it feels weird to be at a temple  for example  and cold approach a stranger to just start conversing with no context  so far  this has been my experience  where the people i reach out to seem to not care to have anything to do with me  whether that be a group of travelers fine on being amongst themselves  or locals who don t want to interact with a foreigner i try and respect their space in these cases  but i can t help but wonder how people on this sub end up having such rich experiences with those they meet traveling  how do you plan your trips  and orient your daily activities  lodging  etc  to facilitate the process of meeting new people as much as possible ,0

after covid  i want to quit my job and solo travel long term  am i crazy ,i graduated college last year in may  i ve been working full time since and have saved up about  45k  by the time covid is over and travel is fully opened and weed again  i estimate i can grow that to around  60 75k depending on how long it takes   i m 25 m  i have a decent job making around  50k yr  can double my salary if i stay with thepany for another 5 years  but i hate it  i don t hate thepany  i don t hate the people  i don t hate the job  i hate feeling like i m wasting my life sitting in an office doing things that i don t want to be doing all i have ever been told in life is go to school  get a good job  buy a house  get married  and have kids i have a college education  i have a good job  i rent my own house  i have a beautiful girlfriend  and yet  i m certainly not satisfied  the only thing i m missing is the kids  and i don t want any  but i m pretty confident a child won t make me happy either  i want to explore the world beyond the suburbs that my great grandparents  grandparents  parents and now myself have lived and worked in our entire lives  i want to experience different cultures and see new perspectives  i want to explore something bigger than myself  i want to ovee my fears and anxiety  i want to develop and grow into a stronger individual  i want to learn to love myself fully and befortable alone  solo travel seems to satisfy all of these  right  it s so easy to getfortable  then before you know it  15 years go by  you are 40 years old with kids  a wife  a mortgage  you are no longer living for yourself  you live to support others  there s nothing wrong with this lifestyle if it makes you happy  i am at a very crucial point in my life where i need to decide which road i am going to take  i m still young  i have no kids  the only debt i have is 20k in student loans  250 monthly  i rent  my car is paid for  i have a good amount of savings  one or many of these things may change in the next 5 years  so i ask from anyone who has taken the jump  can you please share your wisdom and experience  how much money did you have saved up when you left  what is was your long term game plan after cash reserves dry up  how long are you going to live the lifestyle and what is the plan after  where did you go  can you give me any advice specific to my situation  would you do it all over again edit  this post turned into great discussion and i truly appreciate everyone s kind words and motivation  i really needed it  i want to thank everyone for their input  it has been invaluable to me  after reading a majority of theents  i want to address a few of the most asked questions  1  why haven t you paid off your student loan debt  i ve heavily considered it  i decided not to because the interest rates are low  3 5  all federal loans  meaning  i could invest the same amount of money that i would use to pay it off  earn 7  interest in the market  and profit the 3 5  spread  but if i m going to be traveling long term  i really don t want to deal with it or have to worry about it at all  so i will more than likely pay it off before i leave  2  is my girlfriending with me no  my girlfriend is awesome  don t get me wrong  but this is something i need to do alone  our relationship is still new  we aren t on the cusp of getting married or anything  and she knows this is something i am considering  i ve been transparent from the start  3  how did i save so much in that amount of time  zero expenses  well not zero  but pretty damn close  i was living with my dad for 17 of the past 18 months after i graduated  i just started renting at the beginning of this month  i paid nothing in rent  nothing in utilities  student loans have been deferred due to covid  i own my car  the only expenses i had were my phone bill  car insurance  and whatever food activities i wanted to spend money on  this allowed me to save almost all of my ie  i also worked for my dad occasionally to earn some extra cash whenever i could  i realize not everyone has this opportunity  i am forever grateful that i did 4  can you work remotely  is your industry easy to get back into  yes and yes  my job can be done 100  remotely and there are plenty ofpanies in this industry that i could seek employment from with my experience  unfortunately  my boss is old fashioned and conservative in his ways and wants everyone in the office 5 days a week  that being said  and with all of the helpful advice and wise words people have given me  i have laid out a new game plan continue working and saving for at least the next year  this will allow me to build up more experience  put away some more cash into my reserve fund  and pay off my loans  i ll be able to stick it out for another year  hopefully by then covid will have passed and people will be weing of foreign travelers again  i will then propose to my boss that i continue working for thepany on a part time basis 100  remotely so i can travel and have some of my time back  if he declines  i quit and travel on my reserve cash for awhile keeping expenses low and living frugally  once i need to start making an ie again  i will look for a 100  remote position in my current industry  it shouldn t be hard to find  if that doesn t work  i will use some of the other great tips in this thread for making an ie while traveling like online tutoring or teaching english i m sorry i was not able to respond to many of you  i have been busy with work  ironic lol  hopefully this update will be sufficient  thank you again to everyone whoented and for your kind words  you truly have made this decision so much easier  the leap does not seem nearly as intimidating after hearing all of the great stories about how it worked out for people and how they did not regret it for a second  much love everyone  may we all satisfy our deepest desires and live a life of fulfillment and meaning ,0
i need a break in the uk,i m a phd student just entering my second year  i m doing some teaching but it s conducted 100  online  and my area is basically philosophy  so as long as i have my laptop and kindle i can basically work from anywhere the last few months have been  shit  to say the least  my dad suffered a spinal injury affecting his mobility  was sent a cancer screening test  my mum was diagnosed with a heart condition  my partner of 4 5 years  father had a stroke  my brother lost his job  i had to move out of my flat near the university because i couldn t find affordable nearby aodation  and i m now meant to be doing teaching and research at the same time  all the while  i can t travel to vienna and live there for a few months as i hoped to   so the alternative is probably somewhere here in the uk i need a break  i need to get away somewhere quiet and beautiful  with some nice cafes i can just read or write on my laptop  some pubs to get a pint in the evening  and nature so i can get some fresh air and just get away from all my worries  the thing is  i don t know where to go  i ve always wanted to spend some time in edinburgh  but airbnb doesn t show anything remotely affordable for me  i was hoping to spend maybe 3 weeks away somewhere new and different  maybe spend about  500 on aodation  but i m not sure where to go  i d love to spend some more time in the lovely yorkshire villages  but i just don t know where to go does anyone have any rendations  i m not sure whether i should be looking on airbnb or  booking  or hostelworld or something else might be worth mentioning that i don t drive but i m very happy to get a train  and i ll probably be based in york by the time i can realistically do this i d really appreciate anyone s help or advice on this one ,0
to be solo travellers   ever worry if you vepletely romanticised the idea of solo travel and maybe you ll find one day its not for you ,this is a worry i have a lot  i haven t had the means and opportunity yet to just take the leap with solo travel and see if its everything i ve ever wanted  and dont get me wrong  despite my fears  i still definitely wish to do it as soon as i can  but i ve been into the idea of solo travel for a really long time now  subscribed to here  read solo travel literature  watched vlogs etc and the whole idea is something thats always excited me  i ve even influenced friends and coworkers who ve had the means to go and do it and they ve always been thankful  in general i enjoy solo activities like eating at nice restaurants alone  going to the cinema alone etc   and yet i cant shake this feeling theres a chance i wouldn t enjoy solo travelling  the only travelling i m use to is with friends and family  and now i m just worried i ve built up the idea of it so much  its not that it wont live up to my expectation  but that i wont enjoy it as much as if i hadpany  not to be cheesy but this problem at some point reminded me of that one quote from tangled   gt  rapunzel  i ve been looking out of a window for eighteen years  dreaming about what i might feel like when those lights rise in the sky  what if it s not everything i dreamed it would be gt  flynn rider  it will be gt  rapunzel  and what if it is  what do i do then gt  flynn rider  well that s the good part i guess  you get to go find a new dream which has provided me some hope that  as soon as i do take that first leap into solo travel  i ll find it intoxicating and will jump into another adventure  but i guess my question for theunity is two 1  are there any other  to be solo travellers  who also lurk here and feel similarly 2  and for people who have solo travelled and felt like this before  what were your first time solo travel experiences like edit  thank you all so much  the responses have been overwhelming and you guys have been a massive help andfort  so much practical advice and helpful antidotes  lt 3,0

solo hiking and camping,last week i did some solo hiking in the mountains near me  i was staying at a hostel near me which was great and i had people to talk to every night  i also enjoyed hiking alone because i could go my own speed  i even went to a winery tasting alone which was pretty nice too because i flirted with the waiter the whole time  however i didn t like eating alone at restaurants  and when i went for an overnight backpacking trip  i found that i don t enjoy camping alone  this was super surprising to me because i m usually very reserved and i don t mind my ownpany  i live alone and never get lonely but if i go out to the woods  suddenly i m wishing for conversation budget  hostel   33 a night  i made most of my meals  gas to get there was probably my biggest expense trip length  5 nightsdestination s  new hampshire white mountains aodation  the notch hostel  one of the best hostels i ve stayed at  activities  hiking mostly  camping  wine tasting ,0

have you ever bottled up something bad that happened to you during solo traveling ,sorry if that s a confusing title i ve always loved to solo travel  but as a young women  my desire to do this was always met with skepticism and fear  my family discourages my traveling because they don t believe it s safe for a woman to travel alone  before i left for my first trip  my mom called and begged me to reconsider  even offering to reimburse all the money i spent  i almost caved just because i hated how upset she was  but went through with it and had a great time  my friends think it s odd and kinda dangerous as well but they re supportive  solo traveling opened up the world to me in such an incredible way and i fell in love with it  i also used every precaution to keep myself safe and it was always enough until it wasn t  i was sexually assaulted on my last trip to a european country that most would consider very safe  i m ashamed to admit this  but i never reported the attack  it s a long road to recovery  but i do believe that i ve made a lot of progress in oveing this  i still can t bring myself to tell anyone i know about the attack  not my parents  not my best friend  not even my current boyfriend  it occurred before we got together  every time i try  it s like my throat closes up and i physically cannot force the words out  i just don t want them to know they were  right  that the worst thing they warned me could happen actually happened  despite everything  i do desperately want to conquer this and get back out into the world  but that s still such a terrifying concept to me now  if i tell them  they ll have all the ammo they ll ever need to keep me  grounded  it would just take a mention of the incident to have me canceling my flight  and reading over this  i realize it s pretty heavy stuff for this sub  i m sorry to dump it all out like that  but i needed to get it out somewhere  and i worried that any other forum would warn me against traveling solo ever again  i m hoping no one else has ever been in a similar situation  but have you ever felt the same fear of telling people when your solo travels go wrong  and if your travels did go wrong  how did you build yourself up again to resume them edit  i m overwhelmed by the outpouring of support here and cannot thank you all enough for your kind words  i was very hesitant to make this post in the first place but i m so glad i did  you guys have restored some of my faith in the world ,0

some thoughts on eurail pass usage in fr  de  austria area  seeking experiences in benelux spain italy poland nordic countries,germans are meticulous when checking eurail passes  french people seem to mainly not give a fuck things that you can get away on french trains but not on german trains  booking an interrail reservation instead of a eurail reservation to get into the french trains where gates check the codes in big stations like paris east  conductors that check your pass maybe 1 in 4 trains you take  conductors that look at the cover of your pass and don t open it  conductors that look at the journeys of your pass rather than the  x days  on the top of the pass that really counts when you have a pass that is say  10 days out of a month  conductors that look at your reservation without looking at your eurail pass  conductors that are cool when you give them a eurail pass but never check that you have a reservationthe austrian version of that is similar to the german version but less intense  my hypothesis is that germany is a bigger supporter of the train passes  unified eu economy reasons  while france is less supportive  i am curious as to whether there are differences between countries i would lump in such categories  strict  germany austria benelux area  and relaxed  france  spain  italy ,0

traveling to vienna from lisbon  covid test required ,i booked a flight to vienna from lisbon but in the meantime it s required to have a negative covid test  done 72h maximum before the flight  and even if it s negative we have to quarantine  the rule reads  28 september  travellers from sweden no longer need a negative covid 19 test to enter austria  travellers from portugal now only need a negative test when arriving from lisbon or the norte region   so this mean only flights from the south are accepted without a test  in the austrian website it reads that travelers from portugal  do not have to present the medical certificate and are not subject to a quarantine if they can prove that they were not present in any other state than austria and the states listed above within the last ten days but if the airport is in lisbon  is there a way to do it and make it work  does anyone know ,0

 report  7 days in catalunya after 4 months in madrid  sept 2019 ,a year ago  i took my first solo trip   a 7 days trip in catalunya  spain  here s a report  it s been a year ago  so i might not remember every detail  sorry for that  i ll speak about my first days spent in barcelona and how i managed to loose a friend there  f k alcohol  then how i spent the rest of the days in different idylic little villages by myself  how i felt and how my feelings evolved  also worth to say that end of september was a good period to go  as the weather was around the 25 30 c and there were not many tourists anymore  or at least outside of barcelona before going on that 7 days trip  i spent 4 months in madrid for my work  this is not the main topic  but i ll write a few lines on it  because why not  i ll also use madrid as point ofparison later  so  in may 2019 i was sent to madrid for a 4 months mission to install the first protontherapy center in madrid  i really loved that city  the vibes  the architecture  the parks    really pleased me  i d love to go back  i enjoyed it much more than barcelona  there are so much things to see there  the retiro park with the crystal palace  the prado museum  all the nice buildings along gran via  if you can spend a few days there  i highly rend the only thing i did not like so much there are the crowds and the heat  that goddammned heat  47 c in full sun in july  still 36 c at 4am  can t even go from one bar to another without getting all sweaty  let s go to the catalunya trip part now  barcelona i spent the first 3 days in barcelona  to reach it  i took a high speed train from madrid  which lasted about 2hours and was fairly affordable  once arrived there  i brought my stuff to the airbnb i booked and went on to visit the city  like everybody  i guess  i visited the legacy of antonio gaudi  with the g el park  cheap entrance i then went to visit the gothic neighborhood  i really really liked it  but be sure to visit it during the day  as it s apparently not that safe when the sun goes down  on the first day  in the evening  i was meeting a girl friend who was my colleague in my first job  she was there on holidays with her boyfriend who seems like a very nice guy  i had a crush a few years ago on that girl and was genuinly thinking it was from the past  but apparently alcohol decided otherwise  i apparently said stupid things  and she does not talk to me anymore  i ll pass you the details  but you can imagine that my trip was not off to a good start  the next day  i visited the casa balto  20  entrance  the casa balto entrance fee is definitely not cheap  but it s worth it  this house is simply amazing  i originally did not want to pay that much but the friend saw the day before had convinced me to go and i m glad i did  i rend to also check the other gaudi houses  even if only from outside  as they are quite grandiose  unfortunately  i could not see the inside of the sagrada familia  the tickets need to be booked well in advance or you need to go early enough to have day tickets  limited amount  the barcelonetta beach is also quite nice  lots of little bars where you can take a drink or food and contemplate the sea  i was lucky enough that in the end of september there was not many tourists left  but the weather was still more than good  i also visited the ciutadella park and a few markets then on the last day   i just walked around the city  feeling like i d do whatever i liked and my feet took me to the picasso museum  also really worth it  as you can discover the evolution of the life of the artist  it might actually surprise you  i then went on to barcelona airport to pick up a rental car to continue on my journey  overall  i did not enjoy barcelona that much  it sure is a beautifull city  as long as you stay in the touristic neighbourhood  as i said  i particularly like the gothic quarter  but i feel like as soon as you step out of those areas  all the magic goes away  the appartement blocks are ugly and there s no charm whatsoever  it s just like any major city  rush and disrespect  here s theparison i ll make with madrid   madrid  even though it has no beach  i have to concede  barcelona is very cool for that point  feels much nicer  people feel nicer  and the architecture is more developped   i don t know if it s the good way to say it  but even far from the center  i still liked some of the traditional charm that spanish appartment blocks have  even recently build blocks felt that way  where in barca it just  didn t  also  it s catalunya and they are proud of it  they don t really like tourists nor airbnb  they are not faking it and show it clearly with signs almost at every balcony  girona after taking my rental car  i drove to girona  for games of thrones fans  that s an interesting city  it was used to film some parts of kings landing and braavos  it actually really feels like a medieval city  the cathedral is purely grandiose  the arab bath are very interesting  the old castle is beautifull and gives you a nice overview of the city  i loved those little streets  with paved floor where you can just walk with you eyes up and try to catch every detail you can from all the different houses and atmospheres you can feel there  i really rend to go to girona if you have time  i spent half a day there and enjoyed it a lot  just take time to drink a spritz  or whatever suits you  at the bottom of the steps of the cathedral  watch the other tourists just look at this impressive building  wander in the little streets  cross the bridges and look at all those little houses that are short to fall into the water  just be prepared  that s even more catalunya than in barcelona for the nationalism  but it sort of has its charm  begur  amp  other villages at the end of my half day in girona  i took the car and headed to the begur area  i dropped my stuff at the hotel i booked  the hostel sa barraca  this was a relatively cheap hotel but with very good value for money  60 night i think  i especially rend it for the hosts  it s an old couple  there super adorable  they speak a basic english and french  the breakfast was really nice  and the room very confortable  i had what i think was satin bedsheets  imagine my surprise  also  the sunrise there is absolutely stunning  you have a wonderful view on the sea from your room if you are lucky  if you have to pay a bit of extra to have it  just do it  there that holiday feeling when you wake up with the sunrising on the water  you know it s gonna be a good day  it wars your heart  i could just stay there  eating my breakfast and contemplate the scene that was offered to me  i stayed for the next 3 days in that area  the village of begur is nice  you can access the ruins of the castle   different from the castle itself  on foot via the nice little streets in the center of the village  there s quite a bit of history there  with houses inspired from cuban architecture  the next day  i visited some of the most beautifull villages i ve ever seen  except maybe this year in northern italy  but in a different style  if you like old and well preserved little medieval villages  i highly rend pals  peratallada and pubol  peratallada was definitively my favorite  there was almost nobody there  but my god it s beautifull  so much peace  colorfull plants on every wall  i could just stay there for a while  thinking about nothing  just staying lost in time  as this village obviously is  you don t have to spend much time in those villages  as they are relatively small and close together  it took me half a day to do all three  starting from begur at 8 am  during the afternoon  i drove to the cute little village of sa tuna  this is a gem that not many tourist know about  if you like tiny beaches  with crystal clear water  cute little white houses on the sea side and almost no tourist   go there   also  the spritz there is cheap  i took a bit of time to chill on the beach  relax  read my book and i had a swim  after 4 months of very hard work  that s the first swim i had in the sea that summer  such a wonderfull feeling  that  is holidays  water was quite chilly so i did not stay long so  after that wonderfull swim  i took the road again and drove off to llafranc and callela palafrugel  on the beach  not the town itself  those are two other charming little villages  also with those typical white houses  i again let my feet take me wherever they wanted to  those are sush beautifull little places   if only my boss wouldn t have called me while i was peacefully reading my book on the beach to ask me to go somewhere i did not want to go on my return from holidays  i should have just shut my phone  that ruined my moment  but i consolated myselft with nice food after that  which was nice  tapas  never enough tapas  the last day was for figueres and cadaques  those were on many lists of places to see  well  except for the dali museum which is well worth it  don t spend more time in figueres  it s nothing special and even food was not that great  i went on to cadaques  which in contrary to figueres  is absolutely worth it  it s a bit like the other sea side villages with white houses  but slightly bigger  slightly more narrow streets  more nature  i really enjoyed it  just stop for an instant  take an ice cream  sit on the edge of the wall above the water  and relax  look at the sea and do a bit of tourist watching  which can sometimes be fun  there also a tiny dali museum there  but it s not really worth it  i encourage you to just walk at random in the streets and enjoy the vibe  in the evening  i took the car back to my hotel  to have a good night of sleep as i had to wake up quite early for quite a special day  hot air balloon trip i woke up very early as i had to be at 6 30 at the parc natural de la zona volc nica de la garrotxa  why so early  i m glad you asked  today is the day i was taking a hot air balloon trip over this former volcanic region  they ask you to arrive this early  simply to enjoy climbing in altitude with the sun rising  that was  in my humble opinion  one if not the most epic scene i ve ever witnessed  this is absolutely stunning  imagine one moment  you are inplete darkness  in almostplete silence  except the burner from the hot air balloon breaking it from time to time  but it also warms you up so it s actually appreciated  also  3m tall flames are kinda cool  you are rising above the floor  as you climb up above ground   far far away  you notice the first slim lights of the day  but they don t reach you yet  as you continue climbing up  and the light from the sun is slowly growing  you notice a slight white ish pellicule of fog sticking to the ground  only the little hills from the volcanic past of the region are pointing their nose through those tiny clouds  the lights are amplificating  it bounces on the hills and the fog  with a nice and warming orange halo  you are still in silence  everyone of the 10 people on board is totaly silent and contemplates the beauty of mother nature in front of us  trust me  i have tearsing up my eyes while rememoring this  then  when the sun is up  the pilot of the hot air balloon starts unpacking the  breakfast  a glass of champagne and catalan cake  i usually say no to alcohol before noon  but i figured  oh well  if not now in the magical theatre  when  then  he gives you explanations of what s happening  where you are  how to drive that big balloon  and how to land it  he also tells you that depending on the wind  you may or may not go very far  it lasted a total of 1h30 ish  of pure contemplation and pure magic  after you land  two 4x4 areing to pick you up  and the staff kindly asks you to give them a hand to fold the housing of the balloon that has now deflated and lies on the ground like a dead monster  once you do that  they bring you back to the center where you took of from  they round you around a table with everyone that was on board with you and they serve you a true feast  gosh  i thougt i was gonna explode after so much delicious catalan food  after a good hour of eating and listening to stories of the guides  it was time to go and visit the last villages before heading to the airport and go home the next day  just fyi  i think the hot air balloon trip   the food was a package and costed about 230  all included  seems expensive  but well worth it  once again  the area and the scene were just epic   last half day during my last afternoon  i visited a few places  amp  villages that were left on my list  i first started by going into a forest not that far from where i did the hot air balloon trip  this area is full of gorges but i unfortunately did not have enough time to do them all  so  i did go to the gorg del mol  dels murris  it s a bit less impressive than on many pictures of the internet  especially because there was less water at that time  but i was there for a good 45 minutes  i just sat on the floor and i let any thoughts flow and go  trying not to focus on anything particular  maybe it was meditation  i don t know  never done that  this felt good and that s all that matters  next  i went to castlefollit de la roca  internet pictures are showing a tiny and cute village on the edge of a cliff  sure  from afar  it s impressing  the village itselft  not so much  i just found it quite ugly  not that interesting and dirty  i think i spent 20 minutes there  then left  i stopped with my car on the way to besalu as i had the view on castelfollit on its cliff  which was more interesting  last village i did was besalu  really rend it  you can t miss the old stone bridge  and the narrow medieval streets of that village  it s worth it to go there if you have time  but don t plan too much as an hour or two are more than enough  also  don t eat there  i could not find a single restaurant that looked like it was really worth it  which brings me to the very last place i visited during my stay   olot  if you look on a map  it s true  it s close to where i took the hot air balloon trip  but i my hotel was also there  so it makes sense  i walked around the city for a bit  it s a nice little town and i saw it from above during the hot air balloon trip and it had a nicely shaped form for a city  there s nothing that exceptional about it   then headed to a tapas restaurant  then i headed for the last hostel room  which was a nightmare  did not check before  but it was above a bar  luckily  my night was meant to be short as i had to drive to the airport to be there at 8 in the morning  this conclude my report on the trip itself mental state as i mentionned in the beginning of this report  this trip took place directly after very intensive 4 months of work in madrid  i was truly exhausted both physically and mentally and definitely needed a break  i was slightly afraid of going alone on holidays as it was my first time doing so  i often travel alone for work  but this was different  i did not know what to expect  if you ve read everything  you ll know by now that my first day of the trip did no go that well  with me loosing a friend  linea  if you read this  i m sorry again  luckily for me  or not  i ve had enough drawbacks in my life to be able to go over this quickly enough for the duration of my stay  i ll worry about this when i ll be home  the rest of the trip went fine  i sometimes did not really know what to do  i had change of mind regarding what i wanted to see or visit  where to eat  would the restaurant accept only one person  they usually did  i discovered that i enjoyed beeing alone with myself  even if sometimes i was missing one or two of my friends in particular  i could indeed just do whatever i wanted  just let my feet take me where they wanted  not get out of bed in the morning if i did not want to  this was a good occasion also to reflect on myselft  i haven t discovered anything i did not know  but i kinda understood more of what i already knew  i just regret not turning my phone off and checking my professional emails during my stay  i should learn to leave work aside to truly enjoy the break conclusion i liked my first solo trip  i understood a bit more about me  i prefer madrid to barcelona  i loved the begur area and the  garrotxa park  i liked it so much that i did it again this year  in northern italy  you can probably find my report from mid september under  7 days in northern italy  somewhere in the posts below  enjoy the reading  and if you have questions  feel free to ask  cheers edit   imgur link for hot air balloon trip    link ,0
i have never traveled solo before  i am planning my first solo road trip  how is my plan so far ,what s up everybody  i m 23 years old  and i haven t been out of town in over a year and i have been saving all my 1 s and coins for a year now and i have a pretty good amount of cash saved up  i want to take a lone road trip next month  and i have never went on a long trip alone before  i live in central illinois  and i want to go to yosemite  i also want to stop by pikes peak on the way  i m starting all this planning by creating my route and breaking it up into 8 10 hour stretches of driving  from where i live  my maps app tells me it will take 27 hours to drive to yosemite  i will only be able to have 8 days to make this trip happen  i have sundays and monday s off from work  and i m going to take 1 week off for this trip  i m planning on leaving work on a saturday to shower and put my things in my car and leave around 1am just to get a start  and i will probably find a rest stop 2 3 hours out to get a nap in my car since i will be pretty tired after working 13 hours that day  that way i can just get the first few hours out of the way and get a head start day 1 my first stop would be in denver  which is about 14 hours from where i live  i m thinking i m going to get a hotel there to rest up and i m going to leave in the morning to pikes peak  day2 it will be around 2 hours to get to the summit of pikes peak from denver  in which i ll spend maybe 2 3 hours at  then i plan on making my way towards fresno from pikes peak i m not sure which places to stop at to get sleep on the way to fresno  but i m guessing i could make it about 11 hours and get a hotel room in saint george  utah  day 3 wake up in saint george  and head towards fresno  this stretch would be about 7 5 8 hours  i will be going through las vegas on the way  i don t have time to visit there  but i do want to get a picture at the famous wee sign  when i get to fresno  i m going to find a hotel and settle in  i ll have a few hours to kill so i might just find a cool spot to eat  or grab a drink somewhere day 4 this is the day i get to see what i ventured for  i m going up to yosemite to spend the day  after this i am unsure if i should stay in fresno one more night to spend more time at yosemite  or start making my way back home afterwards  who has been to yosemite before  should i spend two days there a  i leave yosemite towards salt lake city  and stay somewhere in nevada over night on the way there  perhaps hawthorne  nevada which is 6 5 7 hours from yosemite  b  i drive back to fresno to stay another night day 5a i leave hawthorne  nevada in the morning to drive about 7 5 8 hours to salt lake city ing from this way  i ll get to drive through the salt flats  i ve always wanted to see the salt flats in person  i ll hang out in salt lake city for the night and rest there  day5b go to yosemite again the second day in a row  spend some hours there again  and then leave towards hawthorne  nevada to rest for the night day6a  check out salt lake city for the morning  find a nice spot to get some lunch  and then get on the road and drive 9 5 hours to north platte  nebraska to rest  day6b  drive to salt lake city to hang for the night day7a get on the road again to drive the last 9 or so hours home in illinois  i ll get to look through all my pictures and unpack and get some rest before going back to work the next day  although  i only work 4 hours the first work day after this trip  day7b  head from salt lake to north platte  nebraska day 8b head from nebraska to home in illinois to get to bed and wrap up my vacation  how does this plan sound  does anyone know of any better ways to split up each stretch of driving  does anyone have any tips for someone traveling solo for on a long road trip like this for the first time  is there anything i should know about pikes peak or yosemite or salt lake city prior to visiting  thanks guys edit thanks for the input guys  creating a plan for this trip is so much fun  and i am really looking forward to this trip  i have decided that i am going post pone my trip until february march  this will give me more time to plan and prepare  also  november might not be the best time to try and go up pikes peak  or drive through the high sierras lol  i am moving to chicago in march with two close friends  so i am going to plan to make this trip then  when i leave my current job  i am going to take two weeks to go on this trip before i start my new job in chicago  this way  i won t have to feel any guilt from my current employers for taking two weeks off for myself  i know that i can get a week off  but i think asking for two would be pushing it  if i start a new job  i don t think it would be right to take two weeks off for a long time  so i think it s best to take this trip in between jobs  until then  i think i am going to just ask for two days off next month to make a 4 day weekend  and take a little solo trip up to the upper peninsula in northern wisconsin  my dad told me that it s about a 6 7 hour drive  it s touristy and scenic  and there was a lot of people my age around when he was there  at first that idea didn t sound anywhere near as exciting as going to yosemite  because i ve lived in illinois most my life and i was never too thrilled when i have visited wisconsin before  but i ve never really been to the parks up there  so after thinking about it i think that does sound like a good idea  i think it will give me a taste of the solo travel and might prepare me more for my longer road trip i m planning in the spring  it also won t be expensive either  i want to check out the scenic spots at devils lake  and i want to hike around the apostle islands  not only that  but i ll be able to get a case of that famous new glarus spotted cow to bring home  i don t get to drink a spotted cow very often  but it can only be bought in wisconsin  where i live  everybody loves that stuff because it s a treat you can t have very often  whenever friends go up to wisconsin to visit  they always take orders for their friends and family and bring back spotted cows for everyone back home  if you re unfamiliar  spotted cow is just a farmhouse style ale  we love it here in central illinois again  thanks for the replies  i m very excited to plan this mini wisconsin trip and take my first official solo trip  have any of you traveled wisconsin  have any of you been to devils lake or the apostle islands  if so  how was it  are there any other places worth seeing in wisconsin ,0

met a suitable one while traveling,during september 2019  i decided to bagpack across europe as a graduation treat  it was a 2 month trip with no prior planning  while my time in germany  someone in my hostel suggested me to try out paragliding in interlaken  i googled it and found it quite amusing  so while i was traveling from frankfurt to bern  i saw a girl in my train  i started a small talk with her and soon we both found each other truly interesting and started having longer conversations about ourselves  when we reached bern  i told her that didn t make any hostel bookings and would be leaving for interlaken 2 days after  she asked me if i wanna make a booking in the hostel she was staying in to which i agreed  we connected to greater extent through the conversations we were having  while traveling the old city  the only thing in my mind was to make a move and kiss her  i think she was thinking the same  we spent the whole night across a lonely sight across the aare river  we talked about life and had some deep talks  i made a move and we had sex in the open  after 2 days  she agreed to travel with me to interlaken  after spending a fun day in interlaken  we came back to bern  from where she had to leave for france  we were extremely sad to leave each other that day and had a perfect make out at the train station  we exchanged our snapchats and said goodbyes   since then we have been connected through social media and have came even closer to each other  no i think she s is the one i always have been looking for  i m thinking to propose her soon ,0

isla holbox one of the last,i had been eyeing isla holbox ever sense i did a roadtrip in the area  and it was exactly what i hoped for  a gritty but refined get lost kind  of an escape option in covid times  and not for everyone which is what keeps it what it is  i  had thoughts of  the mosquito coast  an old harrison ford film on this  trip  as with any place you can find like this  it wont be long before  it changes  as for now  humbly enjoy an unforgettable experience first  things first  travel light  grab bug spray and exchange for some pesos   then wrap your head around getting to the island from the airport  you  could hire a quick prop plane ride  drive or shuttle  for most  a  shuttle does the trick and provides you with a perspective of the  undeveloped area outside of cancun  a scheduled time shuttle is a very  reasonable price or you can pay double for a private ride  my suggestion  is to use the private ride to get there because the fair includes  shuttle  boat ride and cart taxi to your hotel  now that you ve had the  guided walk through you ll see how simple it is to return on your own  with a scheduled shuttle  this is a 2hr drive so if arriving into cancun  later just stay at one of the close hotel options  next morning you can  have your private ride arranged from the hotel or shuttle back to the  airport for a scheduled shuttle time isla holbox if driving through  undeveloped countryside  then taking a boat ride to arrive on a  primitively refined island sounds like your taste  you ve just nailed  it  so now where to stay  after back and forth debating i decided on  tierra del mar  bingo  what you have here is the perfect scenario for a  visit to the island  value  location and a peaceful size  its a highly  maintained minimalist hotel  more of a bnb  with only 6 rooms with  patios  a small zen courtyard  pool and breakfast area  and just outside  the courtyard doors you have immediate access to the vibrant pleasure  of the primitive town and all its character  not to mention the beach of  course is just an ally away  this as opposed to an upscale stay on the  beach made more sense to fully absorb the personality of the island  and  that s really how it felt regardless of what you decide  everything is walking distance or a quick cart taxi away  after the trek  to get here  then quickly checking in and dropping your bags  all you  want to do is walk along the amazing waterfront  white sand  pond calm  mint green water and knee deep for a couple hundred feet  its so eye  catching that cloudy days are even more beautiful then blue sky because  the grays  blue and mint green is another worldly sight  sooner or later  you ll decide to sit down with your feet up and grab some seafood for  lunch at raices  i had the best sweet spicy octopus ceviche salad  concoction i ve ever eaten  and washed it down with a marg on the rocks   then carried on north to the end to get my bearings for several spots  for diner and drinks later on in the trip after that i was ready  to return to the quiet sanctuary of the hotel  pool time with a  refreshment until dinner  there s a market just steps away for the  essentials  that evening i began with my first dinner at zapata  a hand  crafted cave just right off the street with no flooring  the perfect  ambiance and grilled fish dinner to start and end the first day  night  cap back at the pool and called it a day  the next morning i awoke to  the quiet and newly manicured zen of the small courtyard from my patio   an assortment of breakfast options  and most importantly coffee  is  awaiting every morning at 8am  perfecto  i took my time that morning  before heading  now south  along the coastline to the end  honestly one  of the most unforgettable beach walks you ll ever have  the perfect  blend of natural beach beautybined with sections of dilapidated  colorful structures  and again best seen cloudy for contrast its  about 2 3hrs of walking once you get back to the hotel so pool time  once again before dinner  refreshment in hand again of course  after a  great couple hours relaxing at the pool it was time to get ready for  din  a much anticipated steak night at the rooftop of parrilla de juan  a  nice little walk through the town square to a colorfully tiled  staircase leading above to steak heaven  one of the best flavor of meat   no sauce  i ve had  and perfectly paired to savor with an old fashion  to wash down  take your time here  enjoy every bite and the open rooftop  evening  and with that back to a night cap at the pool and called it a  night  boat day in the morning another perfectly manicured  courtyard step over to breakfast and coffee  the quiet minimalist  mornings here are calming and very enjoyed  especially being the last  morning to enjoy  the cart taxi would be arriving soon for my boat  excursion for the day  i could have simply walked to the beachfront and  hired the excursion myself but the prices are so reasonable even booking  through the hotel is shocking   speaking of price  it really should be  noted how great of a value this island visit it  it s very very  reasonable  to get the best pricing for smaller business make sure to  have pesos  for the fancier drinks and dinner spots at hotels a cc is  fine  for the excursion i went with the multi island tour  nothing  really note worthy except the sandbar stop  which is worth it alone   other than that its just a great day out on the mint green waters before  relaxing back at the pool for my last day i wanted to grab some tacos  street side  so i popped over to barba negra for an assortment of taco  offers  its everything you d be looking for  good vibes  great drinks  and mouthwatering tacos  from there i was set for my last time by the  pool and the big decision  the last night dinner choice along with a fortable shirt and my slip ons   there s a couple choices best for this that end on a fancier note  and  to be upfront  honest and fair i didn t make the right choice  i wanted  to end with sushi to enjoy the fresh option that seems no brainer  i  went with  what was highly rended  tamashi sky bar  unfortunately   being the covid situation the dinner area was really just a pool area   its back off the beach and the sushi was just ok  my suggestion is to  end with dinner on the water at casa las tortugas or las nubes  both are  the finer hotel options on the island and offer a very scenic dinner  experience on the water but hey  noplaints the evening was  still very enjoyed and ended with a last night cap back at the pool  the  next morning i awoke early and enjoyed the short walk back to the ferry  terminal  a last gritty and quiet pleasure that will be remembered  forever  the few early streetside vendors preparing coffee and juices  and tortilla shops long at work already  then on to your last ferry  ride  on the top open deck  to ponder what you ve just experienced  the  perfect blend of primitive and refined option with the energy of one of  your favorite tropical adventure films  the 7 15am shuttle will be  awaiting for your ride back to the airport  enjoy pro tip  have  pesos on you for your beach walks  there s several stops to grab a  refreshment  hagel at the beach with the vendors for your boat day   especially with a group  do grab a dinner night at luuma  and consider  trying different hotels  especially for the last evening along with  dinner ,0

my solo trip to berlin during a pandemic,i just got back from a weekend trip to berlin from venice  i m a 23 years old girl while the airport was almost empty and i encountered no queues  my ryanair flight was packed  but everyone was wearing masks and using hand sanitizers  i arrived to shonefeld on friday and took the covid test immediatly  it wasn t mandatory but i took it anyway  i d rather be safe than sorry  there was only a five minute queue to get it  i got my results through the app  the same evening got to my hotel by using the s bahn which was almost empty i than took a walk around the city  by german law you are not required to keep your masks outside  but i wore mine all the time  even when i was alone  i noticed that germans do not like to wear masks  wheather it was outside  and someone even didn t wore it inside places the only ones who where wearing masks where tourists from other countries the next day i took a free walking tour  we wore masks and keep 1 5 meters apart between each other  and we were a small group anyway  all the attractions visited were outside on sunday i took a tour to sachsenhausen  a concentration camp  this one was really sad but really interesting  all partecipants respected the social distancing rules i didn t eat at restaurants  i only eat take away in my room to be safe and wore gloves when taking my food  before leaving monday i took another covid test at the airport amp x200b i think we should travel  to an extent  the guides i spoke to where almost moved to tears that somebody showed up for the tour  because us travelling is the only reason they have a job and can provide food for their families  if you travel  be careful  wear a mask  take covid tests if you can  and of course check the rules of your country and the country you want to travel to  safety is always the priority amp x200b ps  sorry for my bad english,0

are there any places in america that i should avoid stray towards as a black british traveller ,i ve been wanting to travel to the us for a long time  and i ve heard that there are many places that are less safe than others  on account of gang activity and racism among police citizens i am mixed caribbean welsh  with facial piercings and pec length dreadlocks  in case that makes any difference i m also a short guy  at 5 6  in case that also makes any difference  in terms of maybe being more or less imposing to the general public and police officers thanks  i hope to be able to select a perfect us destination soon  lt 3edit  for context  ie from cardiff  which  as a former port city  is one of the most diverse cities in the uk   the city can  however  be dangerous  and knowing what s what and who s who goes a long way over here   racism  however  isn t that big of a deal here  at least in my experience  and what racist experiences i have had here are mostly just kids being retarded  or people with genuinely decent intentionsing out with kinda dodgy questions statements edit 2  for the most part  i m not really worried about racism among the public  and am more worried about areas in which being black could get me shot  for example  going off of what i ve heard read of course  that s not to say that i want to visit a fully bigoted  southern stereotype kind of area  but as a person  as long as it s only an annoyance and not a danger  racism doesn t really bother me all that much  provided i am safe ,0
first time solo traveler,i have an unexpected week off before the holidays and have never travelled alone before and interested in doing it during that week  i m 24f and from up in minnesota  i know a popular destination for northerners is the southern states for warmth  but i m allergic to the sun and covered in tattoos  so i m usually hesitant for warm destinations  at least where the sun is consistently present  i m also very  spooky  oriented and love history and art  what would be some safe destinations for solo female travel in the states during covid times that would align with above interests  thanks much ,0

trip to munich  berlin  prague  and krakow   advice needed,hi  in mid late october i m thinking of doing a 14 day trip to munich  berlin  prague  and maybe krakow if i can squeeze it in  i m currently from canada which  for now  is allowed unrestricted entry into these countries  this is my first trip to europe so i might have to move slower due to my inexperience i know a moreon first central eastern europe trip is prague  budapest  vienna  but both vienna and budapest aren t allowing visitors from canadagoing into prague first would mean i can t go into germany due to covid restrictions  so i think i ll have to start with germany i d appreciate some advice on whether this rough schedule would work given my interests interests  beautiful sights like neuschwanstein castle  the alps  prague castle  salt mines  museums  history  trying new foodi ve roughly allocated 3 days to each place since the 10h flight from canada to berlin will happen on day 1 and the return flight from krakow to canada day 1 4  berlin  10h flight to berlin  take the deutsche bahn to munich on last day  5 hours day 5 8 munich  day trip to the bavarian alps   5 hour train ride to prague day 8 11 prague  either 9 hour train ride or 1 hour flight to krakow day 11 14 krakow  if time permits  would like to check out the aushwitz memorial  fly back to canada on last day  10h  flight amp x200b is this enough time in each place  if i really need to  i don t mind eliminating one of these locations so i can have more time to enjoy the rest without being rushed and stressed out ,0
my best friend tainted the last european trip we took  would i be wrong to tell her i want to travel alone from now on ,about two years ago i traveled to europe for a week with my best friend and could not believe how horrible she acted  we stopped at a fast food restaurant on the way to the airport and she made aent about how the worker should be in college and not working there  at the airport  we ran into someone we went to high school with and she laughed at him for working there and having to watch us take a trip to spain  when we got there  she was extremely controlling  talked down to me and others regularly  barely wanted to go anywhere or do anything while on the trip  and had a micromanaging attitude 80  of the time  while i still managed to have a great trip and found a new obsession with traveling  i didn t have fun with her  i had fun in spite of her  when we got back home we didn t speak for months  she later apologized to me and said that she realized whenever she feels insecure or bad about herself she treats others badly to feel better about herself  i ve forgiven her and i still consider her my best friend  but i later found out she told the rest of our friend group that while she can be very  motherly  i was the one who was  stubborn  and didn t want to do or try anything new  thising from someone who didn t want to go to any main attractions  sites or events and wanted to go to the same cafe every day  to me  that was her way of not taking full responsibility for her actions  i decided after that i will never travel with her again and travel solo going forward  recently  our friends group started planning a trip for when covid dies down  i ve made it clear that i won t be going and while i haven t said it outright  they all know it s because she s going too  they said i should move past it and give her a second chance but i refuse because i know how bad she acted  i truly love her and we are still best friends  but i ve decided not to let her taint another trip for me  am i wrong for that ,0

how far does 18k usd get me in 2021 2022 ,i plan on traveling from may 2021 to august 2022   by that time i will have saved  18k   given the way this pandemic is going  assuming borders open  it is safe  or there s a vaccine  etc  i plan to travel in the u s  and canada to mostly national parks or outdoor recreational areas from may october   i have recently converted a minivan into a camper  so that would get me  20 mpg and a place to stay each night   if the pandemic lifts a bit  then i will probably explore some cities for no more than a couple days at a time too based on how this pandemic is going  i would probably head to se asia in october 2021 and jump around until around february 2022   i know this is vague but i honestly wouldn t plan much more other than a one way ticket february 2022 i will hopefully ski out west in the u s  for 3 4 weeks or so  ski passes  800 by the time march 2022es   hopefully  latin america is cleared up from the pandemic and i can travel starting from mexico city and make may way to colombia   latin america is one of my favorite regions  so if the pandemic clears up quicker than expected there  then i would probably skip se asia and double my time there i know this is extremely vague and very variable  but i m just trying to day dream about life after uni and push off studying for my exam that i haveing up later   does this sound feasible on  18k if i live frugally   i also plan to get an airlines credit card that should get me a couple round trip tickets from the sign up bonus ,0
traveling solo again at 69 and every day has been a joy,i backpacked in europe a few times as a young man  taking overnight trains to save on lodging  occasionally rolling out my mat on the floor of the train because there were no empty seats   i traveled without any advance reservations for lodging  and no firm itinerary   upon arriving in each new city  i would stash my stuff in a locker or bag check window at the train station  and search for a pension or hostel on foot  then return later to retrieve my pack   it was easy to meet other travelers my age and join up for a few days when we were going to the same cities   i moved every few days  visited a lot of places  and had wonderful experiences as a new retiree and single  i yearned to travel abroad again but worried if i could manage it solo  feared it would be difficult to meet people  had concerns about health care abroad  and didn t think i would fit in at hostels   this time around i wanted to stay in each place for a week or more and explore deeper  at a more relaxed pace   i also wanted more privacy andfort than my hostel provided 40 years ago  and expenses were less of an issue  my first trip to europe was on a student loan  the government  amp  banks didn t  send the money directly to the college back then and i knew i would not get enough time off for a long trip once i started my career   i had no money so i borrowed 2k and spent it all on a 5 week trip  knowing i could repay the loan once i graduated and got a job for my first  test trip  post retirement  i decided on a  month long visit to argentina and uruguay   before leaving the us  i booked a studio apt for a week in buenos aires and an inexpensive hotel for a week in montevideo  but left myself an open itinerary for the last 2  weeks   i heard good things from locals about the lake region of argentina and decided to go  booking a studio apt in bariloche for a week   i had a wonderful time and managed to deal with the curve balls that were thrown at me traveling alone in countries where i didn t speak the language  such as a mrsa infection in my knee that required two weeks of 2 strong antibiotics   treatment at an er was prompt  professional and free   but didn t meet many people other than the managers of the properties where i stayed   so when i returned to buenos aires for a week before my flight home  i decided to try a hostel again   i got a single room rather than a dorm  i use a cpap machine for sleep apnea  which can annoy others  and i need quiet to sleep well   it was a very small and basic room but i quickly met a couple of young guys newly arrived from germany  over a beer in theon area   we hit it off and i felt right at home   i concluded that both solo travel and hostels were still great at age 69 six months later i left for a month long  solo trip to berlin  krakow  and budapest  staying at hostels and a ymca   i had a blast and enjoyed the hostel experience   they were mostly much nicer than in my youth  and i always chose well located ones with good access to public transport   they were often in  hipster  neighborhoods with lots of activity and youthful energy   i was always able to get a private room at a good price   my step tracker app reported that i walked an average of 13 miles per day  far more than was my custom at home   every day was a joy     afterward  i reflected on what enabled me to feel such joy even with the occasional panic arousing catastrophe  such as getting pickpocketed in berlin my 2nd day   i noted two big differences from my life at home   first  i did not watch tv much at all because even when i had access  i could not understand the language and i preferred to be out exploring and eating   at home  i was use to watching tv at every meal and in the evening  but the political news often got me riled or depressed  and theercials often seemed annoying  manipulative and dishonest   the most salient difference though  was the fun i had taking pictures everywhere   this involved exploring with curiosity and focusing on things that were interesting or beautiful while framing out the boring and the ugly  then editing and sharing them with friends back home   this has be a metaphor for my life today   i look for the beautiful and the good  and try to avoid focusing on anything else   it makes me feel joyful   there are plenty of things wrong with the world  and plenty of great things too   whether i focus on the bad stuff or the good stuff  the world  remains the same  but i don t   the more i practice looking for beauty and goodness  while avoiding ruminating on things that make me angry  confrontational or sad  the better i feel   it s a bit selfish really  but i choose to act in ways that make me feel good   when i feel joyous  i act better   people seem to respond positively to this  and if my being kind  humble  generous  and friendly brings others some good feelings too  that s great  it s a win win   but mostly i do it for me   i am eager for covid to get under control so that i can go on my next solo trip ,0

solo road trip out west  advice on route and itinerary ,so i m planning on a road trip out to montana wyoming for the middle end of next june  starting from minneapolis  driving to glacier np  then staying in bozeman for a 2 nights  on my first full day in bozeman  i planned on doing a day trip down to yellowstone via us 191  us 20  and grand loop rd in yellowstone before heading back to bozeman  then the next day doing the beartooth highway  stopping at vistas and possibly the summer ski area off that road  on my way to stay in greybull  then rapid city on us 14 with a detour to devil s tower  then the next morning back to mpls i want to incorporate grand teton np into this somehow  but i don t want to have to spend another night somewhere  what i considered is going through yellowstone on us 191 on my first day  hitting teton as well afterwards  then back to bozeman  this would let me hit both of them  but i would be spending 8 and a half hours on the road that day  which isn t a problem in itself  but if i m going to these amazing places i don t want to be in my car all day  the next day i would go from bozeman to greybull on us 212  but take a detour to see the yellowstone canyon  and try to go skiing  this is another 8 hour drive does anyone have suggestions on this  other things to do along this route  or other places to stay in wy on a budget  i looked at a map and say greybull was about halfway between bozeman and rapid city  so that s why i picked it edit  thanks to some suggestions  i think i m going to only do 1 night in bozeman  and instead stay closer to yellowstone the next night  it s also bing apparent that i will need to add an additional day to my trip if i want to hit teton too ,0

is paris worth it ,paris has always been one of my top destinations but recently i ve been feeling uncertain about it  i actually usually avoid cities  i really dislike modern buildings and crowds of people but i love old buildings and architecture and art and the whole atmosphere of an old city like paris  but one of my first doubts was when one of my online friends was raving about how much they wanted to see london for it s old buildings and such  and it hit me that i ve been to london a million times and it s terrible  in my opinion  the amount of modern buildings and shops swamp the old stuff and anything worth seeing is surrounded by trashy new stuff  i thought to myself  if i d never been to london  i d probably see it as some fantasy version too  and is that the same way i m seeing paris in my mind  the only city i can really think of that pretty much meets expectations is edinburgh  but even then nowadays it s overrun with tacky tourist giftshops another friend of mine who lived in france for several years as a kid said she took a trip to paris and said it was really dirty and full of litter and overall unpleasant  she didn t make it sound like the romantic  gothic city i have in my head  but she might have been viewing it through a different lense  she doesn t really care for old architecture or anything like that  i know it will be touristy to some degree  of course it will  but i m not sure the extent or how much of paris is actually lovely old buildings and streets and how much is office buildings and tescos  was anyone dissapointed by paris  i m hopefully going to be travelling europe solo next year and want to spend a lot of time seeing old castles  and i don t know if paris is something i should just skip and leave as a nice fantasy in my head because now i m really worried it will dissapoint me ,0

my  1 travel advice  wake up early,i really don t like being in crowds  and i m guessing most of you don t either   the easiest way to avoid crowds is just to wake up early   you can have a very leisurely morning breakfast  go for a nice long walk alone in a very picturesque neighborhood or park  go see some usually crowded sights  and then have an early lunch when restaurants aren t busy and the food is freshest  i m also self conscious when eating alone in most busy restaurants  but i don t care at all when there s hardly anyone else eating   i just saw a post in travel where someone said it s impossible to avoid pictures with ridiculous crowds at the great wall of china   well  i just woke up early  and walked nearly the entire public section of mutianyu very leisurely before anyone else showed up except a couple vendors setting up for the day   ,0
phone plans while traveling abroad ,hi everyone i had a quick question about picking a phone plan when i take my trip  i expect to be gone about a year and a half  so obviously i ll need a phone with data my two options are below 1  google fi   i have enough people interested that i can get the family plan and pay  45 month for unlimited data  talk  and text  data is all i care about though pros  i get to keep my same number without having to port it over to google voice  nearly worldwide coverage  no need to get a new sim card every time i switch to another country  unlimited datacons  it s not very popular yet and i can t seem to find reviews from travelers  price  while decent  is a bit highpared to developing countries  i ll be traveling mostly in latin america  so i m sure i can find cheaper plans option 2  use my unlocked phone and stick a sim card in with a new plan every time i go to another country  i d import my number to google voice so as long as i have data  i ll be able to talk and text with people back home without a hassle pros  potentially cheaper  more options for service providerscons  it will be a hassle to switch sim cards every time i enter a new country  i m not sure if unlimited data plans really exist in latin america i m honestly leaning towards option one due to sheer convenience  but want to know if anyone here has experience with the service also  the cost of an unlimited data plan with local carriers would be a factor into my decision  anyone have any sort of data for an unlimited plan in  say  mexico  maybe on claro o movistar thank you all so much ,0
suggestions for road trip from chicago  27m ,hi all  it looks like i ll be working from home for several more months  mypany is saying until january at the earliest  since i can work from anywhere  i m thinking that i can travel and work remotely instead of staying at home in chicago  any suggestions on where i should go i m thinking of going on a road trip  returning to chicago after around 2 3 weeks  i ll still work m f for the usual 8 hours  though i would be open to taking occasional pto to go sightseeing or drive to my next destination  most of my sightseeing activities will be in the evenings or weekends  i do enjoy visiting museums  but a lot of them are closed due to covid  and i find that they re not always open in the evening  having said that  i do enjoy sightseeing in metro areas and eating out at different restaurants  a lot of the northeastern states have imposed quarantine requirements  so i ll probably avoid those  international borders are still closed to tourists  so i definitely won t be driving into canada or mexico have any of you done this recently  any suggestions ,0
why do so many people on workaway only accept female volunteers ,i don t wanna sound some like incel here but it s kinda ridiculous how many hosts state they want female only for jobs that aren t even historically seen as being feminine  one to work at reception in a hostel was what led me to write this post  on top of this  there seems to be a large number of male hosts whose review section is exclusively younger women i can totally understand in some cases where a single woman may not want some random bloke living in her home but more often than not this isn t the case  i just feel as though i m paying the same price for a lesser product ,0

trip report   2 weeks  mostly  solo traveling around costa rica,i have just finished 16 days travelling around the beautiful country of costa rica  here is my trip report on what i did  and some tips for anyone planning something similar in the future   part 1   playa guiones the first section of my trip was spent in the nicoya peninsula in nw costa rica  i stayed in the pretty sweet little town of playa guiones  it had some decent restaurants and is great if you like surfing  there aren t any hostels here to speak of  so airbnb it was  the main reason i was here was to see the  turtles in ostional  it was a pretty awesome experience  the olive ridley turtlese on the beach  en mass  to nest a few times every year  to see the number of turtles on this one beach at 5am was a pretty special experience  interestingly  the turtles are pretty solitary creatures out at sea and onlye onto the beach to lay their eggs  before returning to life alone   note on turtles best to visit early in the morning to have the best chance of seeing them  the cost to get in was approx   20 which goes towards the conservation of these turtles  it is one of only 2 places in the world that this event happens so if you re in the area  and it is happening  i really rend it   part 2   santa teresa next  i visited the small town of santa teresa on the southern coast of the peninsula  unfortunately  there are no buses from the north south of the peninsula  the only option from playa guiones is pg   nicoya   puntarenas   ferry to paquera   bus to cobano   bus to santa teresa  should take you about 14 hours to do what could be a 3 hour drive  in st  i stayed in the super nice  luz de luna  the place is run by a really cool belgian guy and has these amazing little huts overlooking a great jungle garden  seeing monkeys in the evening was pretty sweet  here i didn t do a huge amount except explore the local area  there are atvs that you can rent in the main town and there are loads of tide pools along the coast which are pretty cool to swim in  again  this is a good place if you enjoy surfing   or yoga   part 3   puerto viejo de talamanca i then did a very long trip from santa teresa to puerto viejo de limon  on the caribbean coast  i spent a night in san jos  just to break up the journey  this was by far my favourite part of the whole couple of weeks  i really liked the caribbean food  way spicier than what i was getting on the pacific coast  and there was a lot more going on  i stayed in the pretty awesome  rocking j s hostel  thanks to many rendations on here for that  the hammocks were super cheap  5 p n  and the staff were super chill  the location is great   30 second walk to the beach  here  i mainly ate loads of awesome caribbean chicken and fish   went to the amazing  gandoca manzanillo wildlife refuge  where i saw loads of toucans  macaws  sloths   loads more monkeys  to get there  i hired a bicycle from rocking j s and cycled the 13 or so km  apart from that  i also did quite a bit of snorkelling in the sea off rocking j s and met some pretty cool people if anyone has any questions  let me know  they re normally my favourite thing to read on reddit travel subs so hope some of you enjoyed this one  i haven t yet worked out how much it all cost but  probably  quite a lot  costa rica is frustratingly expensive ,0
would anybody be interested in virtual travel related hangouts ,i know i m one of many who would love to go on a trip right now  but due to obvious reasons  and also school  am not  but my most favorite part of my trip was meeting people from all over  and thankfully that s something we can do from home  would anybody be interested in virtual hangouts where we can just share travel stories and talk about where we re from  where we ve gone  and about the places we wanna go once this is all over  some background about me  i m a 23 year old woman in st  louis  missouri  i ve only been on one solo trip and it was for 6 weeks to southeast asia  everybody i met was so wonderful and it was amazing meeting people who were likeminded in that they decided to up and go to a whole foreign country by themselves  i love talking about travel related things but don t have any friends who are as interested as i am  so i d love to meet you guys  i m thinking maybe we could start a discord server or maybe zoom meetings every now and then  let me know what you guys think edit  i made a discord  i m not sure if i can send links in a post or not  but just in case  i won t  i m gonna spam for a minute andent the link on everyent on here so far  which might be annoying  but i don t wanna miss anyone and it s faster than messaging them directly  so find the link in theents or shoot me a message  ahhh so happy so many people were down for this  i m excited to meet you guys ,0

extravert or introvert as a solo traveller ,i have long struggled to decide whether i feel more introvert or extravert and usually tell people i m an extraverted introvert  or an introverted extravert but recently i feel more and more that i probably am an introvert at heart  and one of my main pieces of evidence for this is my desire to travel solo for extended periods of time so this got me to wondering if you all  my fellow lone travellers  also identify as such  or if there are some of you amongst us who indeed consider themselves extraverted  and if so  do you ever struggle to travel alone or do you genuinely enjoy it ,0

what is something nice you have done for another  traveler or local  while traveling abroad ,i saw a post not too long ago about people being helped while on there travels and it got me thinking the other way around and paying it forward  so i ll go first when i was in italy and vernazza with my bro  we were hiking up to the top to catch the sunset on the town  iconic pic  and on our return we helped an elderly lady  it was getting very dark and she could get her door closed and lock it  we used our lights and tried for like 10min  i was able to understand little and used my spanish  some words overlap i think  and then held her hand and walked her down to town  she thanked us and we went on our way  i would hope someone would assist my grandma if she needed help  sometimes it is the small things that we think are insignificant that add up and matter  came across a good quote i saw   amp x200b when people talk about traveling to the past  they worry about radically changing the present by doing something insignificant  but barely anyone in the present really thinks that they can radically changer the future by doing something small ,0

i am very pessimistic right now ,i really was hopeful about next year and years after next about traveling and doing my own thing but i feel like it will be least likely due to covid and just other things going on in this country  i had my mind set on visiting my first foreign country which is south korea and to either work or study there but my family is telling me that it is not possible to go alone as a woman because its not safe to go outside the country  should i listen to them edit i just want to point out that i wanted to travel to said country and then think about living somewhere else but much later on but i do not think it will be possible in theing years due to covid  also i have  been asked if my family controls my life and they dont control most of my life  since i am a very small woman  they dont care if i go by myself out in public like to the store work  or just taking a walk but they dont think i could be safe traveling both in and outside my country which is the us  sorry for the long edit ,0

where did your wanderluste from ,during covid i m taking some time to reflect why i am getting so crazy being cooped up in 1 place  where did all that wanderluste from  is my desire to travel only driven by social media and blogs  i would love to hear where yourse from after some reflections i realise a lot of mine just came from my nature and childhood experience  since 7 yrs old   mid 90s  i often travel with my sport team to other provinces topete  air travel was not popular back then  so we mainly travel by train  and in case you didn t already know  train travelling through vietnam is one of the best rides in the whole world  the scenery always excited me  and i couldn t stop dreaming of jumping out of train alone to experience the landscape  to climb down the cliffs to touch the ocean  to walk among the endless lush forests and hills  to sample all the weird dishes by the vendors at every station in every province my dad also had a globe and i often fantasized being in different parts of the world  and back in the 90s information and imageries were scarce  so my imagination of the world was actually very different from reality being in a new strange place always excited me more than scaring me  during middle school i sometimes cycled 20km to the border of my city and that alone gave my the thrills i guess what i m trying to say is that i can now understand that my decision to travel was largely innerself driven rather being influenced by marketing  i would also urge my fellow travellers to think about what drives you  so that you may find the experiences that truly make you happy when travelling  ,0

do a backcountry trip ,0

little ramble  story,i first started traveling 2 years ago   my first actual solo travel trip was thailand  i stayed there for 3 weeks and loved it   the food  the beaches  the chaos  and the freedom   but i didn t meet a single other traveler until my last day  i made no effort to   i didn t realize meeting people was one of the best parts about traveling   now since then i ve been on 5 other trips and my first goal when arriving is to get some good food  and meet some people at the hostel   before traveling i was sort of shy  awkward and self conscious   now i m way more outgoing  and i enjoy being around new people and learning their story  people say they want to travel to  find themselves  and i m not saying i did  that  but once i made the effort to get out of myfort zone it seriously had a impact on my life   i m super motivated now  organized and overall more successful in everyday life because of traveling ,0

trip report  playa del carmen  mexico  september ,i am sharing some current information about the quintana roo region since i am here now  also willing to answer any questions if i missed something you are curious about background  lease ran out  packed stuff into storage and decided to work remotely from here indefinitely  starting september 7th atmosphere  most locals wear masks  usually it is the foreigners that don t  having said that  there does not seem to be that much concern for covid  at least at this point pared to what i experienced in cities in the us people have their temperature checked and are given hand sanitizer before entering stores or eating at restaurants  etc as of mexican independence day  clubs were open until 2am  or later and bars have bands music playing traffic is down and there is a major shortage of parties in places like tulum  etc  tulum in general felt very empty sights activities all of the cenotes are open as far as i know  with the same precautions as stores  temperature and sanitizer  tulum and coba ruins opened last week and i think chichen itza opens today  there is a maximum capacity or visitor limit i believe scuba diving is happening and the beaches are open people the travelers i meet are mostly from north south america and europe  though i have met asian ones as well  tons of people doing the covid nomad thing flights i flew on american with a layover in miami  social distancing wasn t observed but otherwise the flights left and landed on time with no issues  the flight to miami was full and the flight to cancun maybe 65  full aodation marked down a lot  so far i ve stayed in airbnb apartments  hotels and hostel dorms hotel   wouldn t know covid existed except for front desk employees wearing masks and using hand sanitizer airbnb   hand sanitizer  masks hostel dorms   full or 50  capacity depending on the rules of the place  only real issues have been a mildew smell if anything fitness gyms have reopened and the one i am going to only requires a temperature check and a mask to enter but optional basically when working out so nobody wears one dating the first week was a bit much  polar opposite of the action i got from march to may summary if you are not very concerned about contracting covid  this is the place to be  my mental health has improved 50x and i couldn t be happier to be out of the us for now  especially with winter and elections approaching ,0

never booking with booking book directly,i had booked about two months in advance for a trip i had planned to monterrey big sur for mid september  as the date approached for the trip wildfires started to break out around the area around mid august  these fires were bad and were making air quality horrible and were getting close to the hotel we were staying at  it was counterintuitive to stay somewhere so close to the fires only to just stay indoors the whole time  or worst get stuck out there 2 3 hours away from home   although our stay was still a few weeks away  i made the decision to try to cancel the booking because there was no sign the fires would let up  they did not let up even on the date of our booking  i couldn t have known that and the hotel booking couldn t have known that either  but judging on how bad the fires were and still are  they refused to refund my money   the property we were staying at told us specifically that we had to deal with booking in order to get our refund  upon contacting them they then told us that we had to deal with the property directly in order to get our refund  this back and forth lasted for a good hour  that s not an exaggeration  an hour of back and forth trying to reason with booking  the property made it clear that on their end  they had not received any payment and that since i booked with a third party  booking  they were the ones responsible in issuing me a refund  even if the property wanted to they couldn t refund me money they hadn t received   making this very clear to the handful of representatives at booking that  assisted  me  they insisted that the property was the one responsible in issuing me my refund  you can see how infuriating it is when all they did was throw their hands up and tried to shoe me away when clearly stating to them there was no money to return on the property s behalf  they stated that because the property did not clear the transaction they had nothing to give back to me  so my question is now  current day  where did my money go  of course to booking   i am now out the money i paid for a reservation we never attended and despite filing a claim they still won the case and kept my money  stay far away from booking  i m not sure how it is getting refunded with other third party booking agencies  but definitely do not book with booking  whatever money you think you re saving it s not worth it  just book directly with the property and save yourself the frustration and financial stress of giving your money to apany whose interest is not with the customer but with their own pockets ,0
tourist and backpacker density by country,having traveled solo in a number of countries  i d say the density of tourism in a place really has an effect on your experience  it s not that more tourists is necessarily a bad thing  while i felt a place like rome was rather overcrowded  i loved the social atmosphere and ease of meeting fellow solo travelers in a tourist dense country like thailand  conversely  being in a place with few tourists can often feel more exotic and unspoilt  but can also lead to feeling bored or lonely  which countries  in your experience  had a very high density of tourists  what where some of your favorite  or least favorite  destinations where you felt like one of the only tourists there ,0

travelers of which country did you find to be the chattiest ,by chattiest i mean more inclined to approach total strangers to strike up a conversation and more easygoing receptive to be approached  i guess you could say extroverts but there are many cultures where their people are very extroverted but only with their own  i m talking about people who are outgoing and engaging with strangers regardless of their background and which were the opposite and yeah  i m asking about other tourists travelers you encountered on your travels  not locals  people on their home turf ,0
should i go solo after breakup ,update  thank you so much everyone for taking the time to respond  i ended up cancelling and the cancellation fee actually ended up being  400  not too shabby  someone mentioned that if i went alone  i would be paying an extra  1 250 for the trip  covers the ex s cost  and that sealed it for me  when the time is right  i ll save that money to go solo to a place where i ve always wanted to go alone   japan  edit  sorry  probably posted in wrong sub  my relationship just ended before our trip to an all inclusive resort in riviera maya  mexico  at the end of next month  debating whether i should still go  i would lose  500 for canceling but would get  2 000 back   500 is a lot to lose  i don t want to ask my ex to help cover the loss if i decide to cancel because i booked the trip and paid for it all as his birthday gift  i also make more than him so i wouldn t want him to pay and on top of that  he was against going in the first place  although  as time went on  he was really excited about going  in the grand scheme of things  is a  500 loss a lot versus going alone especially during these stupid covid times  i ve never before traveled alone this far from the united states and i can t find anyone else to go with me either  so thinking about going alone but not sure if i ll be depressed while there ,0

nyc solo travel  good idea ,i have a break from sept  25 30  i don t really know what to do  i mean i ve been hiking with my friends  but i miss traveling  i canceled two trips to europe this year  my first vacation was supposed to be my first solo trip in finland  amp amp  estonia and the second vacation was suppose to be in france with friends  also  i was planning to take my dad to nyc for his birthday  but since he is immunpromised  we decided it s not a great idea to take him to nyc  will take him there once we get the vaccine  anyway  i m 26 years old  male  and a nurse  so covid doesn t really scare as much and will wear the proper precaution to protect myself  amp amp  others  since i live alone  i can quarantine once i get back  i just want to go somewhere  i m from nm and the infection rate is about the same as ny  so i feel morefortable vs going to states like tx or fl  i just want to know if someone has experience solo traveling recently to nyc  or even before covid  and give advice to someone who has anxiety about solo travel  thanks ,0
what s up with , all these posts asking for ways to meet people  find group activities  etc  is there not a pandemic going on  do you just don t believe it  or are you too selfish to care  have i imagined this whole thing  am i taking crazy pills for the record i think in the u s  at least you can travel solo being relatively safe if you take the proper precautions and keep to yourself  camping  takeout  washing hands  social distancing  wearing a mask  but seeking out groups and activities  these are the people that are going to make this second wave in the fall so much worse  200k people already dead in the u s  and people in this subreddit are talking about what they should do for new years  how about stay the fuck home and keep to yourself ,0
how do you people afford to do all this traveling  ,and i mean partially money  partially time  i understand some people have amazing jobs with amazing salaries  what i find perplexing is how some can afford to take month long vacations  do your jobs give you that much pto  are many of the people in this sub that do frequent traveling self employed  is it funded through parents  maybe this sub is just more well off then average this is especially perplexes me when i see 20 something year olds do this often ,0
planning trip to central europe once covid is done,hey there  i m a 20 year old from canada  obviously right now is not the best time to travel  but once covid is done in a year or two and it is safe to travel  i d love to visit the world  i think that for my first trip i ll go to central europe  from my research these seem to be the best cities in central europe  what do y all think  berlin  budapest    prague    vienna    krakow    amsterdam  is this correct  what cities would you guys add to a trip like this  and how many days would you rend spending in each city  the big factors for me are the following  great nightlife  great places to visit during the day too  making friends  hostels are great for this i hear  is the language barrier big in those cities  i m fluent in english and in french  thats it  finally  financials are important for me too  i don t want to go to cities that are too expensive  i m just a student so maybe i ll have about 5 thousand canadian dollars for this trip  if i spend 5 days in 6 cities  that s 30 days  what do you guys think ,0

advice for long term travel this winter,hello  i m a 22 year old american man planning to travel around europe from november march  my parents are currently living in england and i ll be going to see them in november  my seasonal job allows me several months off  so i would like to stay in europe the entire time  i have the time and money to make this work and enough saved for emergencies and returning home  obviously there are quarantine mandates when entering new countries and the possibility of certain areas closing entirely if rates increase  for this reason i ll probably stay in each country i visit for 3 weeks 1 month  possibly more  does anyone have rendations for how to travel safely and ethically during this time  i d like to spend lots of time in rural areas  camping  and volunteering on farms rather than being in crowded cities and putting others and myself at risk  i also plan on living as frugally as possible during this time  not because i have to  but because i want to  for example  camping hostels work exchange for a room  dumpster diving for food  hitchhiking rather than taking planes and trains  has anyone done these things around europe in the covid era  what did you learn  if anyone has other rendations for how to bum it around europe during a pandemic  i m all ears  peace n love  y all,0
good winter sports hostels in europe   mostly skiing related ,hi guys at the end of this year  i want to go solo skiing somewhere in the alps  usually  i went with other people and we just rented or stayed in a small house somewhere  however  this time no one wants to join me so i am planning on going alone  because i do like some social interaction i am looking for good hostels that allow me to do that i tried to google but i don t think there are many hostels aimed towards this  which isn t a problem because i am free to go wherever i want and can  i know hostels are a bit of a problem in these times but i am willing to try it assuming i get some socializing out of it  but hostels that do take the corona rules into account are a big plus what i am looking for is pretty simple  close to skiing areas  or close to free transport  and a place to store my skiing gear  it would be awesome if there are other  somewhat  extreme things to do like ice climbing or snow kiting if you have tips  or just fun stories  please share   ,0

how to solo travel while in a relationship ,sharing my travel plans  after covid obviously  with my partner  amp  realizing that we have very different travel goals for the future  he doesn t like traveling for extended periods of time   has a dog so doesn t want to leave for long  while i want to do multiple multi month trips on a budget  and even live abroad for an extended period of time teaching english  it makes me sad because i don t like doing long distance relationships  but don t want to break up with someone for that reason right now during the pandemic when traveling isn t even a possibility  i was also excited thinking of traveling together  but all those hopes were dashed when he flat out said no to my mapped out trips  anyone have a relationship where one of you travels for extended periods of time and the other stays  how does that feel  how do you cope  anyone broken up with their significant other over this  how did it go  do you regret it ,0

when traveling solo and staying at a hostel is it easier to make friends being a girl or guy or does it not matter ,i ve been lurking at this sub and have recently thought about the idea of solo traveling  one of the things that s holding me back however is the thought of going somewhere and not making friends as i am pretty introverted  this is why the idea of living in a hostel is appealing as it s much easier tounicate and get to know people this however just got me thinking about whether it s easier to be a girl or guy when solo traveling being at a hostel in terms of making friends and joining other groups  now i m not naive and know the concerns woman have when traveling and also living in hostels but just in this specific case of making friends is it easier for woman ,0
 report  7 days in northern italy ,a while ago i made a post with a title like  7 10 days trip in northern italy  here s my report  be prepared  it s long  i ll start with what i saw and did  then will do a small part on my mood and mental health during th e trip  first  thank you all for the advices  i m still in the trip  but have only one day left which will be for chilling and no intense visiting also  it s italy  it s always a good idea to go to italy  my initial plan was   milan   lakeo   bergamo   lake garda   lake iseo  milan i started with 2 days in milan  i have friends there  so it was an obvious staring point  my italian friends there don t like the city  but i quite enjoyed it  i have to admit that for once  the covid situation is making things better as there are less tourists  and hotel prices are lower  i stayed at the hotel flora near the central station  55 night  not good  not bad  ok for solo  i really enjoyed the city  the architecture  the different neighbourhoods  the people  really loved it  my feet after 26km a bit less  i saw the duomo of course  which was pretty much empty  really impressing  and the galleries near it as well  i did pretty much all the da vinci museums   places  except the church with the last supper  as it was closed for the afternoon   i also did a lot of churches  parks  places  the milan university  where you can have beers every night right in front the beautiful main building  etc  i spent the last evening in the navigli area  with a beautiful sunset over the river and the colorfull bars and restaurants  i then moved to lakeo  lakeo i had booked 2 nights in bellagio  at the hotel fioroni  around 65 night  family run  really nice place  had a double room for myself with a tiny balcony  absolutely stunning view on the mountains  could see a bit of the lake on my left  just imagine  waking up  having the sunrise on the yellow houses and the lush green mountains  with an absolute silence  paradise  good breakfast too and free parking  15 minutes walk from the city center  either by following the road with view on the lake  or from inside the village  which makes you arrive on the other side of bellagio  this city village is really really great and beautiful  more tourists than in milan though  on a sunday evening  the monday was totally empty  amazing food  stunning view on the lake  for food  try the enoteca cava turaciolo  simple and good set of cheese and ham  but it s the wine that you go there for  i took a tester of 3 wines  2 reds and one white  one of the red just blew my mind  sfurzat carlo negrid  just  wow  waiter took the time to explain the origins  how to pour it properly  and we descussed a bit  all the little narrow streets are super cute  and for the instagram fans  that s where you can take a lot of the empty narrow streets pictures  the next day  i went to visito  quite nice town  about an hour drive from bellagio  they have an hydroplane club  nice and cute city center  the duomo is quite impressive as well  but that s for the walk on the pedestrian alongside the big villas that you go there  simply beautiful  makes you wish the time stops  i just stayed an one bench for 20 minutes  lookking at the opposite side of the lake  without thinking to anything  only disturbed by a chopper bringing construction material to what i guess is the future villa of a rich person  then i drove to cernobbio  equally beautiful and much more peaceful  but smaller  i also could have gone there on foot fromo  i did not stayed there too long  but still enjoyed it  and  as everywhere on lakeo  the view is just splendid  the last evening i went back to my hotel in bellagio  and i went for supper to the hotel m tropole  i wish i had not  i should have checked google before  i just saw they had the traditional fish risotto from that area  they rushed everything  i got the dish while i still had my aperitivo  then the wine  i ordered the same whine i had the day before  the surfzat  at the enoteca  they did not serve me what i ordered  i got a low grade headache inducing shitty wine  the fish on the plate was  i m pretty sure  reheated in a micro wave oven  that really took my mood down  shame because i was in a pretty good spirit by then at least  i could enjoy one of the most beautiful sunset i ve ever seen in my life   anyway  i got the fuck out of there and we t back to my hotel  prepping for the next day  which was departure day to bergamo  just for the day and spent the night in garda  on the lake of the same name  when i woke up  i did not want to go to bergamo  i was just too in harmony with the lakeo  and i wanted to see the villa del barbianello  which i could not visit before as it was closed on mondays  so i figured  let s go to varena  and take a boat trip from there  the drive was really enjoyable  loads of little cute villages  when i arrived in varenna  i was instantly charmed by the place  this is the typical lakeshore village  absolutely stunning  cute  loving   insert any adjective here  i absolutely love the place  made me think i want to spend my retirement there  as the streets are a bit narrow  not many tourists still felt like a bit more than in the other places  but it s as idealistic as you could expect  got a pizza at the bar il molo  fairly priced  and ok for quality  spirits are cheap too  the ice cream was ginormous and cheap  in the end  i did not go to the villa del barbianello  as i d prefer spending more time in varenna  but still  around 3pm i had to take the road for the 2hours drive to garda  lake garda the drive to garda  the city  was a bit less pleasant then around lakeo  but that was expected  as it s a good chunk of highway instantly  i felt like i should have started with garde theno  as the landscape is quite a downgrade  don t get me wrong  it s also really nice and beautifully  but the scenes are less grandiose than on lakeo many many more tourists there  and if the prices are much lower than on lakeo  the quality is too  the bars are more rushed  hotel is meh  i m not feeling confortable here  i want to leave  i m writing these lines  enjoying  a spritz on the harbor one think that is really nice  is the sunset  there a small cliff going down slowly to the water surface and the sun drops being it  showing you wonderful colors and a stunning view  can tplain about that at all i ve been trying to go to a restaurant two times  but it seems like they don t like solo travellers  that pissed me off more than i d care to say  because i really wanted to go there  tomorrow will be driving to lake iseo  a hotel in iseo and a short night before going to the airport around 5m toe back to my no so sweet belgium mental health first of all  i m not what we can say a very stable person  i have my moods  and they can change quite quickly  that being said  i m still quite rational or i m trying to be if you ve read what i wrote before  you ve deduced that everything was going pretty well until that first disgusting restaurant in bellagio  that started to bring my spirit down  but i spoke to friends through fb and it went ok globally  i chilled while i was visiting everything  stopped when i wanted to stop  ignored what i wanted to ignored  and just did wathever i wanted without caring for anything or anyone  this is a wonderful feeling i did not go into deep thoughts  just left a blank in my brain  looking to nature or whatever was in front of me  and to nothing else basic rule  don t look at your emails  don t look at the news  cut yourself from everything  i ve partially failed at that for the news  but did not checked my mails now  in garda  my mood is really down  i just want to be over with this place  not enjoying it at all  i went to sirmione today  but barelystayed 2h to see and go yesterday evening i just took spritz on spritz  not being drunk  but just to occupy my mind  which is not good  i told my self i d not do that today  well  i ve just finished my second one  but i ll go for food now and not take alcohol i just don t know what to think  or how to improve my frequent depressed mood  one think that cheers me up for after the trip though  is that through a friend we have inon  we ll go to a concert with a girl a fancy   my friend will be there too  but that s totally ok now the sun is slowly going down  revealing a beautiful scene  and that s cool conclusions some places were lovely  others stunning  others not so much  but overall a quite nice stay i guess i have to work a bit more on my mindset and how to improve it to enjoy more the time i spend alone  and go over micro setbacks more easily i haven t met anyone  and did not desire too  so that s cool i ve probably left things aside  so feel free to ask any questions cheers edit   here s the report for the last 1 5 days so last day i went to the lake iseo  as it was planned originally and i ve often seen online that it s sort of a hidden gem it is there an island  actually  3 islands  in the lake  one being much more massive than the others  like it is 9km circonference  it s quite lovely  and the water is really clear  haven t seen anyone swimming though  i went on the island with the ferry from sulzano  5 5  for a return ticket  takes 5 minutes to go to the other side  runs every 20 min  monte isola  the big island  is really lovely  nice colors  quite chill  again  september   covid made it quite empty of tourists  just a few here and there i did not do the whole tour of the island  nor the climb up the castle  i was following my feet  and they brought me halfway up  then wanted to go back down and have a beer  enjoy the view and the very warm weather i spent in total something like 2h there  but it s worth spending more  apparently in june and july they place some floating paths between the islands  so you don t have to take the boat  they were not installed anymore yesterday after taking the ferry back to sulzano  i went to the charming little village of iseo  where i had booked my last hotel  hotel ambra  65 night  quite nice actually  had to wake up at 4 30 to gety plane in milano  and they offered early check out and breakfast by the on duty person for the night  really appreciated iseo itself looks quite touristic  but the inside has some old style italian feelings  which i always like just spent the evening looking at the lake  got a nice  big  ham cuts as starter and a pizza as main  to properly end up my italian stay  had the pasta yesterday at the bussola restaurant in garda now  enjoying an iced coffee at the only starbucks in italy at milano malpenza airport  waiting for my flight there you go  reportplete cheers x2 ,0

moving abroad for work,so i m 25m canadian  i ve done a decent amount of traveling however i ve always wanted to have the different experience of actually living in a new country as opposed to traveling in it  maybe it s the pandemic and the thought that i won t be able to do any extensive traveling anytime soon  but it s really making me want to pull the trigger and just move to a new country and start working living there for 1 2 years  that way i can still somewhat be  traveling  but while also living somewhere new my ideal choices are ireland or new zealand  and i d prefer to work within my field  architecture construction  but i wouldn t be opposed to working any odd job until i could find something else can anyone share their experiences with moving to a new country for work  did you have the job offer first before you moved  or did you just take the plunge and move there without a job and then found one once you were there ,0

eureka springs  ar  or branson  mo ,hi   basically haven t left my house for six months   been taking quarantine very seriously   looks like i ll have to do some travel on family business   no way am i flying   so it s a road trip    branson and eureka springs are at about my halfway point for this drive   gonna grab a motel out that way   as long as i m out there  i ll poke around and see what i can see   masked up and distant of course  and nowhere near restaurants or bars    just wandering the towns for a bit in the late afternoon   evening and then maybe a bit the next morning looked on the web a bit for things going on there and have an idea what s available  but would like an insider   indie   solo traveler view   i like quality museums  good restaurants  and brewpubs  but those are off the list unless they have food drink to go   maybe looking for interesting scenery   outdoor spaces  funny roadside insanity  maybe some walking trails  history sites  and as little consumerist corporate culture as possible  leaning away from branson for that reason   given those criteria  someone talk me into or out of one town or the other  this might be only glimpse of the world for  another  six months  and given these two options  that s kinda pathetic  so i want to choose wisely ,0
happiness only real when shared ,hello fellow travelers the question is in the title  for those of you who don t know it  it s a quote from the movie  into the wild i ve had my share of experiences traveling and i miss it immensely  this is not only due to the worldwide circumstances with the covid pandemic and the measures governments are taking to prevent the spread  my last  real  solo journey was two and a half years ago when i went to the gambia for three months  as part of an internship i got to meet and work with wonderful people that i miss dearly  a colorful culture  beautiful nature and even wild parties at the senegambia beach clubs  experiences for which i will remain eternally grateful after returning to my country  i haven t really felt home anymore  my heart lies with mama africa  the reason for my title though is that i can t share this feeling with anyone back here  no one was there and while they are fully supportive of my dreams to go back  the feeling that happiness is only real when shared is starting to loom on me sure i make friends as i go along and we make memories  but when traveling solo  you don t stay in touch with everyone  experiences are fleeting and while that makes it beautiful  it also hints at the tragedy of the ever devouring nature of time and getting older so my question is really for those that made the move leaving their home country  family and friends for a lifetime of travel  how do you look back at it and how do you feel about what the title suggests i also wouldn t mind hearing stories of solo travelers who  found their pack  or  found new roots  to cheer my too young to be nostalgic ass upthanks ,0

how to reignite the spark of doing trips activities solo,hey all  i m in need of some advice from this wonderfulunity on something that s not  strictly  about solo travel  although definitely is a part of it  but also about doing more general activities alone  so i hope it s okay to post this i ve always been happy to do things solo  be it a city break  going to a gig or just taking in a museum and all that good stuff  mainly for the usual reasons  being single  unreliable friends  just feeling spontaneous etc   however  i ve recently noticed i ve been more reluctant to do these activities myself  for example  i m off work next week and i know this time last year i d have considered and done all sorts of things to fill my time  a city break in europe  have a trip round the zoo  see some of the sights i haven t seen in london yet  i m finding it really hard to get motivated to do these similar sort of things this year though  obviously covides into play  but i was mulling over a little day trip to the coast as it s meant to be a scorcher next week  but i m just struggling to find the will to do it on my own  i feel like i m experiencing a bit of solo burnout or rut  i do so much on my own and have many great experiences that i would  never have had if i didn t take the plunge to do things myself  but part of me is thinking when planning of things to do in my head  i wish i could share this experience with others  it s wearing me down a bit and making me feel quite hard on myself because as it stands  next week i ll just be sitting on the sofa all week  it s even little things like going to the local coffee shop on my own i m feeling resistance towards has anyone else ever felt like this  is there tips anyone can give of how to get out of this mental roadblock i ve set myself for some reason  it just seems very weird  obviously with the exception of covid my personal circumstances hasn t really changed in the past year that would make me flip from preferring to do things solo to the opposite  any advice tips stories would be hugely appreciated ,0

anyone have any cool covid travel stories ,id like to hear some cool solo travel stories that anyone has had during covid  heres mine back in early december i left the u s  for a 3 month journey to georgia   the country    my plan was to head to istanbul for 10 days on my way back to the u s  by the time i left georgia on march 3rd  covid was already buzzing about on the news  after a few days in istanbul  countries started announcing the closure of borders and airports  i had to make a decision on whether i would leave early and head back before turkey shut down or just ride it out  i have a small lawn care business in montana i run by myself so had to figure out if it was worth going back  i decided to put my business on hold and stay  i booked a room for 2 months in a massive 4 bedroom apartment next to galata tower  luckily for me the owners were stuck in another part of turkey and by this point all international and domestic flights were grounded  i had  the entire apartment to myself for 2 months  i met some other people living in the apartmentplex who were throwing lovely hard techno raves on the rooftopplete with lights  smoke machines and other party treats every weekend  at the end of april i met an amazing turkish girl and we ended up falling in love  it was my first time in istanbul so we explored the city and i was able to see istanbul in a way that people had never seen before  normally bustling streets were empty  tourist destinations desolate of humans but filled with the famous streets cats  in july  1 month past my visa expire date  flights started resuming  the only country accepting people flying from turkey was serbia so i decided to head there for a week to reapply for my tourist visa  despite the u s  embassy saying i wouldnt be penalized for overstaying my visa  i still had troubles getting back in  after 3 hours of talking with multiple police and walking all over the new and massive istanbul airport i was finally able to enter  the catch  i had 10 days to apply for temp residency  now  6 months from when i first arrived in turkey  im still here  my girlfriend and i have just moved into our first apartment  i wont be heading back to the u s  until march or april of next year  i know covid has caused all sorts of mess in the world but for me its been a real treat ,0

trip report 2020  from america  cozumel aug 1 30,solo travel  33m  scuba diver  working part time  the flight  there are no direct flights from any of the bay area airports to cozumel  there were some that flew to cancun  but then to get to cozumel would require a  1 hour taxi plus  1 hour ferry ride  i decided on aa because they fly straight into cozumel from dallas  i flew out of sfo  the flights between dallas and san francisco were around half full both ways  excellent  the flights between dallas and cozumel were fully booked both ways  unfortunately  aa does not block middle seats  people were generally good about wearing masks  you re allowed to take it off to eat or drink but you have to put it back on when you re done  aa did a good job of personally reminding people to put their masks back on during the flight   the trip  this was my third time in coz pared to the last two times  it felt like a ghost town  more than half the shops downtown weren t open  bars restaurants weren t blasting music   an improvement  imo  there was a curfew at around 10 pm every night  diving was spectacular  i did 20 dives in cozumel and 4 dives in the cenotes on the mainland  between playa del carmen and tulum  if you get a chance to dive the cenotes  you must do it  it s so different from diving in the ocean  the coral in cozumel looked very healthy  likely because there s much so much less activity from divers and the large cruise ships that dock in cozumel  also did a weekend trip to isla mujeres to swim with the whale sharks  it s whale shark season and they are migrating south  the trip isn t cheap  especially from cozumel  i had to stay overnight in playa del carmen because the trips leave from playa early morning  it was worth to swim with the whale sharks  but i wouldn t do it again some of my favorite restaurants  1  crazy king burrito for their shrimp burritos  2  jeanies  good wifi  good place to watch the sunset  prices are reasonable for a touristy restaurant on the water  3  coconuts  schill beach barestaurant  4  mega grocery store for their ceviche   the social scene  i was working half time and did not have time to put a lot of effort into meeting new people  my days mostly consisted of early morning dives  get back to the hotel around noon  shower  and hop online by 12 30  10 30 am in pacific time  and worked until 6pm or so with plenty of breaks in between  one of the reasons i love diving is because you can meet people fellow divers from all over the world  at minimum  there is always a german on the boat  love the germans  that wasn t the case this time  everyone was from america  which is fine  i grabbed lunch drinks a few times with fellow divers  most of the tourists i saw were age 50 and up  there weren t a lot of ways to meet people organically safety precautions   i had my temperature taken and was given hand sanitizer at the entrance of every grocery store  mall  dive shop  ferry boat entrance  and most restaurants  the larger the operation  the more likely this happened  i did not have my temperature taken at the mom and pop type places    the locals were good about wearing masks  especially in the touristy areas  it was clear that the locals were doing what they could to make visitors feel safe  considering that the island relies almost entirely on tourism  i stayed mostly in touristy areas  probably 90  of the locals i saw wore masks  there was a noticeable decline in safety precautions when i went to the super local areas  unfortunately  the tourists were less great about wearing masks  i would estimate mask adherence to be around 70  truly unfortunate  it makes me embarrassed to be an american   there are rules capping capacity at restaurants  hotels  and other  activities  like scuba diving  none of the places i visited was anywhere near full capacity  now  whether that s because everyone follows the rules in mexico or because there just simply weren t many tourists is not a judgement i ll make   i was not required to show a negative covid test  nor was there any mandatory quarantine  states in mexico are implementing their own rules  so check before you travel   costs    each dive  including equipment rental  was around 40 usd meals   i avoid the touristy restaurants when i can  cost of an entree at a casual touristy place was around 10 usd  obviously it can cost much more than that if you are looking for a fancy place  cost of 3 tacos in a taco stand is around 3 usd   hotels and flight were mostly book on points  my 2 3 star hotel was around 44 usd per night   car rental was around 35 usd per day   isla mujeres whale shark trip was 200 usd   to my fellow divers    the cozumel forum on scubaboard is pretty active and a great places to get dive specific info    to fellow travelers who plan on going to cozumel    the rules are constantly changing  so check before you go  the facebook group cozumel4you was a great resource  be safe  be responsible   to those who think i should  stay the fuck home    stay the fuck home and keep these beautiful places uncrowded for the rest of us  edit  typos  clarity,0

affordable options for aodation to break up a long road trip  usa ,i ve been really enjoying wandering around the region but the cost of motels and airbnb s at nightly rates is really starting to be an issue  i also think staying a week or more in the same place makes for a better experience in principle  without having to sublet an apartment or give up too much freedom  i guess i m on the road  till covid is over  and who knows what that means at this point i ve explored airbnb  including their new  longer stays  option which is monthly  vrbo  hipcamp  and hostels  many with dorm beds are closed  i don t know how craigslist is these days  but if there are any similar options that have a bit more of a security net in terms of vetting hosts or having someone to turn to if things go wrong occasionally there are roadside motels that turn out to have a much cheaper weekly rate but it s really hard to find out about those type of things if you haven t already wound up staying there for a few nights by chance  what does reddit suggest ,0

older travellers staying in dorms ,hi all  i hope this post finds you all well i m heading out on the road for a year long trip across europe to asia sometime next year and whilst i don t want to plan too much i do like to have an idea of the route i ll take and in particular how much the trip is going to cost me so part of the number crunching involves working out aodation costs and it looks like this will be the major cost of my trip until i hit central asia and beyond unless i stay in dorms which would bring costs down considerably thing is i have never stayed in a dorm i ve travelled to over 100 countries and consider myself well travelled but aside from the last year all my trips have been with the ex wife and now i m venturing out on my own and i can t wait but dorms so whats the opinion of dorms for the slightly more mature posters here do you still stay in them  whats the reception like for an older guy  mid 50 s  staying in a dorm amp x200b i wouldn t be staying in dorms exclusively but it makes sense if i m passing through for just a couple of days to keep the costs down i m ok with it but i have a mortal dread of rocking up at a hostal and its party central with late teen early 20 s crowd i would hate that  i m not a prude but i wouldn t now want to hang around with my 20 year old former self your thoughts ,0

montreux   what to see  top attractions,swiss riviera on the shores of lake geneva   montreux  why you need to go there  what to see and where to go in montreux and the surrounding area  as well as how to get there and where to live the pandemic disrupted my travel plans a little  but the whole rhythm of life  and that was a big blow to me  during 2019   early 2020  i traveled almost non stop  making only rare stops in kiev  i m from ukraine one of the most striking travels is the swiss alps  lake geneva and the part of france that borders switzerland  today i will tell you about montreux  a trip to this city was largely due to my local friends  thank you guys  the main attractions of montreuxmontreux is a very small city and i cannot say that it has the beauty that we are used to seeing in ancient european cities  montreux is more modern than historical  usually my main criterion for evaluating a city is whether i want to return  so you want toe back to montreux again and again  or even better   stay here for a while if time is short  just walk along lake geneva  this will be enough to fall in love with montreux  you can heighten your senses by looking at the city and the surrounding alps from the water with a glass of champagne or local dry white the main thing in montreux is the views of lake geneva and its surroundings and stories associated with famous people who have visited the city at different times   from royalty  musicians and actors to famous prisoners  chateau chillon fortressa 13th century fortress that stands on a small island in lake geneva  but actually on the shore  undoubtedly  chillon castle is the main architectural attraction of montreux it is best to look at the fortress from the water the main function of the castle of the fortress in antiquity was the family estate of the counts of savoy in the middle ages  the second function is a prison where many famous prisoners were kept location  avenue de chillon 21  veitaud   montreux  switzerland  just a few minutes drive from the city center  i walked pretty quickly  jazz festival in montreuxthe world s number one landmark event  somewhere it is abruptly even the olympic games in sports  i was both lucky and unlucky at the same time   i got to montreux on the eve of the festival  literally a week before the start and saw all the preparations and the beginning  movement  but the travel schedule did not allow me to stay the festival was called jazz in its origin   it was conceived as jazz  but after 1970  such luminaries of the rock scene as queen  frank zappa  deer purple were its active participants remember the famous smoke on the water deep purple  the song was written in memory of the event when the casino burned down in montreux in 1971 just during the performance of frank zappa  thick white smoke drifted over lake geneva  which inspired gillan to write this song miles davis  nina simone and ella fitzgerald have performed at the festival at various times  after the 1970s  non jazz artists such as pink floyd  deep purple  bb king  oscar peterson and others participated in it the festival can also be viewed free of charge from a boat or boat on lake geneva location  avenue claude nobs 5  montreux  switzerland  right on the shores of lake geneva  city promenade in montreuxthe promenade is a 3 5 km long pedestrian road  from the ch teau de chillon to clarence  there are many flowers along the promenade  so the best time to walk is in spring  each view from the boardwalk is a postcard  especially in calm weather  when the reflections of the castle and mountain peaks are especially beautiful location  along lake geneva  montreux  switzerland  queen studioin montreux  the studio of the queen group was located   montreux mountain  7 albums of the group were recorded here  after freddie s death  a sculpture of a musician was installed on the montreux quay location  casino barri rede montreux  ruedutheatre 9  montreux  switzerland  gorge du chauderonin the old town is the beginning of the hiking trail along the gorge du chauderon  the gorge is carved by the river la baye de montreux  which flows into lake geneva  the trail leading to and from montreux is clearly marked location  old town  montreux  switzerland  lamp trail les pl iadesa non trail path in les pl iades  which is called a lamppost for the fact that there are lanterns along it that illuminate the path the lantern trail is the main winter attraction in montreux  i knew about her  so i included this attraction in the list it is better to walk along the lamppost path in winter  when the light of the lanterns is reflected in the snowdrifts  giving it a slight mysticism how to get there  to get on the trail you need to take the train from montreux train station to les pl iades station  we leave and follow the signs along the trail illuminated by lanterns  better to rent snowshoes  end your walk with a swiss fondue tasting at les pl iades address  les pl iades

the wine cellars where you can taste everything that is produced from local grapes do you know why swiss wine is not sold in your country  because the swiss drink almost everything they produce  so say the swiss themselves  if anything  but at home  in kiev  i did not see a lot of swiss wine the lavaux vineyards are 830 hectares between lausanne and montreux  most use the lavaux express or lavaux panoramic special trains  but it is better to walk along the trails along the vineyards location  lavaux vineyard terraces  puidu  switzerland  daffodil trailthis attraction is also in our bookmarks if we get to montreux in the spring  there are many flower trails in the surrounding mountains  the tourist office of the city has maps with marked trails  or use any cartographic service   there are routes there too  walk on lake genevai left this activity for dessert  the views from lake geneva are not at all like what we see from the shore  it is ideal tobine both walks  water and walking  be sure to take a boat trip to the lake geneva conservation area   there is a lot of wildlife  birds and aquatic life on lake geneva  you can rent any small boat   from a water catamaran or canoe to a boat  you can take a ticket for a pleasure boat  but the privacy of the moment is violated  you will have to ride with a crowd of tourists i was lucky    i admired montreux on a private motor boat  conclusionmontreux definitely has a lot to see and have fun for the solo tourist  if you are from europe  especially eastern europe  i strongly rend that you familiarize yourself in your free time this is my first such major post  i will be glad to hear your criticism and suggestions  thanks for your attention pleasant journey  friends  p s  a few words about travel insuranceyou do not need insurance to enter switzerland  but for your own confidence and wallet safety it is a must  treatment in switzerland is very expensive  besides  insurance saves you from having to look for a clinic or run for medicines  you never know what can happen  so take care of everything in advance and your journey will go smoothly ,0

cooking while traveling in a camper van ,i m looking for advice on cooking while i am out camping in colorado for a week  i am traveling in a camper van thates equipped with a single burner gas stove and a frying pan  i m fairly certain there is a fire pan in effect in the state of colorado so i don t think i will be able to use an open fire for cooking  i will be staying in various campgrounds  i ll eat pretty much anything my main concerns are whether or not the food will store well for the 7 days i am traveling and whether or not they will leave waste  smells that will attract wildlife  the last thing i want is to wake up to a bear trying to get in the van or hanging out around the site i will have a cooler and i can probably find places to get ice fairly easy so that should help with storage  but i don t want a lot of strong smells since the van is a rental and there are wild life concerns i imagine most campsites will have areas where i can properly dispose of any waste like cooking grease or things of that nature but i would like to be sure before i do ,0

psychological benefits of solo traveling,question to all those solo travelers  whats your story about starting solo traveling and what did you gain from it mentally ,0
this is exactly why i travel solo,i always travel alone because either friends don t have enough money or the time  i traveled a week ago to cancun with my supposedly best friend and it was horrible  i wanted to kill her the first day  she got super drunk  vomited everywhere and embarrassed me every single day  i wasn t able to enjoy my vacation at all  she wanted to constantly eat when i just wanted to chill  be by the pool and look at the ocean  ugh honestly i wish i didnt go with her  we are not talking anymore and this ruined our friendship  im definitely going back solo traveling again  i can do what i want when i want to edit  what i shared with you guys was something small  we talked prior to the trip and she is awful atunicating so i would literally have to read her eyes to know what was happening  i would want to be alone with other people i met but she will be following me all the time  there was a lot of drama which i hate  fights with other people among other things  i know we are both at fault so you guys can stop insulting me  the purpose of this post was to say why i travel solo nothing else  i do get drunk but i dont need anyone to take care of me thats the difference  i m doing self quarantine for the people that are so concerned  thank you for the advice  i will keep it in mind,0
7 10 days solo trip in nothern italy,so i want to lay off some pressure by going solo for a week   10 days in northern italy in mid september  i think probably 7 to 17 sept  or something like that  i d like to see milano  i have a friend there  so mandatory  bologna and venice  bergamo looks nice too  i d also like to see a bit the dolomites and the lakeo or garda  but i fear it might be too far or too much  it s not necessary to arrive and leave from the same airport  for travel there  i plan on using mainly trains  as i ve read that the connections should be fairly ok  renting a car is a possibility  for aodations  i m not picky  but i d like to avoid dormitories and not bankrupt myself with 4 5 stars hotels   any rendations  for or against  such an itinerary  any tip is weed  i ll post a report when ie back ,0

what sparked your interest to travel ,i m sure everyone has a moment where they knew they were meant to travel and explore these moments are special and definitely keeps us ignited  personally  when i was a child  i used to love riding the airplane  sitting at the window  and gazing at sky  it was magical  i remember the day before every flight i couldn t sleep because of how excited i used to be to reach the airport and explore the  very  expensive shops there  ride on a plane and think to myself what should i eat this time i love bread and butter  and most importantly just opening the window and getting lost in the view even now  i am 19 f  and trying my best to have a side hustle  save up money  learn languages  and go abroad for couple of years  i used to envy my friends who travel to study abroad   i still do lol so yeah i think it came naturally to me   and tbh  i can see why  traveling very much suits my personality  love to learn  explore  try new stuff that are not very  suitable  for me lol what is your spark ,0

missing ireland,i ll get right into it  i haven t really traveled this year  my last travel was a cruise to mexico in dec 2019 with my gf and my god i regret cruises  nothing against them they just aren t my thing  anyways  i woke up in one of those depressed moods today and in attempt for a pick me up i decided to pick up my favored drinks from when i studied abroad in ireland  guinness and carlsberg  my two favorite beers while i was there  as i sip away i am reminded of great nights with great friends and freedom  i don t know if anyone else feels the same but  there is such a genuine sense of freedom and happiness when i traveled abroad  thousands of miles from anyone who knows you and you can just be yourself and live such a genuine life  when i studied abroad i went without knowing a single person and the ability to just live is something i have missed every single day since  the ability to not worry about any expectations or any responsibilities except for the ones i chose  for me ireland was what hooked me on solo travel and i miss it so much at this moment  more than i am proud to admit  probably why i am here talking on reddit  i don t know if its just me or if its something inherent with your early 20 s where you are just going through some kind of quarter life crisis but idk  does anyone else feel this way  what countries or places hold this place in your soul  i find myself wanting to go back more and more and i think when covid gets out of our way a return to ireland might be the first on my list ,0
for people who travel long term  6 months  how often do you have days doing absolutely nothing ,i m trying to picture what my schedule will be like and i m imagining that i will have a lot of days where i simply do nothing  by nothing  i mean things like walking around  drinking coffee  eating street food  maybe visiting museums  but not anything costly no tours  no trips out how often do you stay in walking distance of you hostel and how much do you usually spend on those days ,0
is social travel dead ,curious to hear from anyone who s traveled in the last couple of months and was actually able to socialize while doing it  considering taking a big leap  but even though i do enjoy solo time quite a bit  i m not sure i could handle not socializing at all due to covid  anyone have first hand recent trip reports where you were able to connect with locals or fellow travellers while abroad ,0
has anyone ever traveled somewhere  and fell in love so much you moved ,i d traveled to japan three times while living in korea   the first time i was with my girlfriend  and i had a blast   the second times i went solo  visa run  but it was still pleasant   in fact  the more i thought about it  the more i had a quiet appreciation for it   i thought it might be nice to live there for a year or two   not sure if i d live there longer  but i would for sure live there for a period of twelve to twenty four months i was wondering if anyone had visited a place before  and then thought  what the hell   i ll move here ,0
trip report  rome   milan,hi all   i just got back from a week in italy  where i spent 4 days in rome and a day in milan  i ended up flying into milan from london and then catching a train to rome  this was due to flight prices and availability as a result of the last minute nature of my trip  getting through security in both airports was quick and painless  i suspect this is because there are fewer travellers   aon theme on this trip  on arrival in milan  i had to fill out a piece of paper listing the details of the trip  e g  address of aodation etc  for covid  i took the malpensa express into the city centre of milan  which takes around an hour from there  i took a  frecciarossa express  train down to rome  this took around 3 hours  it was afortable journey down where there were many empty seats  i had all four seats and a table for myself  you are asked to wear a mask for the whole journey  they provided a pack  gloves  mask  sanitiser  water etc  on the train  rome  aodationi stayed in an air bnb in  trastevere  for the duration of the trip  the restaurants were operating and there was some nightlife  people hanging around  buskers etc  it took about 15 30 mins to get into the city centre on foot  depending on where i was trying to get to  generally  public transport was not that convenient from where i stayed  i did get two ubers when i was worried i was going to be late  i e  the first tour and the train back to milan if i went again  i think i would try to stay in monti  currently  you can get some good deals aodation wise  weatherthe weather in rome is very warm  it reached mid thirties  celsius  every day by noon  this meant i was always wearing short and a t shirt  it also meant i was drenched in sweat from all the walking  it stayed warm late into the night  thankfully  i had ac in my flat  there are also mosquitoes  so don t make the mistake of leaving the windows open    sightsi did two paid walking tours on two separate days  colosseum  roman forum and palatine hill  the vatican  sistine chapel and st peter s basilicathere were about 10 15 people on both tours  all the sights were pretty light on tourists and there wasn t much of a wait to get into any of the sights  as an anecdotalparison  our tour guide said usually there would be 40 tour groups at the meeting spot before our vatican tour  we were the only tour group there  as a result  it was an amazing experience being able to see the sights in suchfort  all the sights were open from what i understand i normally do the free walking tours  with the tipping at the end  but the paid ones came with tickets to get into the sights and a very informative guide in my case  thepany i did them with is  city wonders  foodiesi love to cook eat and it s always a big part of my holidays  fyi  every restaurant requires you to wear a mask upon entering the restaurant here are the places i went to and can rend  roscioli salumeria con cucina    everything  for lunch or dinner      i had the carbonara  but this place is a must in my opinion  i wished i had more time to go a second time     call ahead and book as it is popular  solo travellers can get a spot at the bar      it is the only place that was a little pricy but well worth it  bonci pizzarium    pizza  and deep fried breaded balls with fillings inside      best to do this the same day you go the vatican as it s that side of town      it s more a hole in the wall takeaway joint but there are some stand up tables outside  otaleg    gelato    very nice flavours of ice cream or sorbets  great relief in the heat      it s in  trastevere  so maybe tie it in with a meal from around there  e g  pizza from  da poeta  da bucatino   cacio e pepe  rich and creamy      i would say the food was good  but there wasn t much around the area that i saw  i ended up in the area after exploring i had good food at a few other places randomly with travellers i met and they were delicious but maybe not worthy to go out of the way for generally  i think everyone should try the 4 classic pasta dishes when in rome    cacio e pepe   carbonara   amatriciana  and  alla gricia  the wine was also amazing  although i am not much in the way of a wine connoisseur    milani ended up with half a day as there was a delay on the train back from rome  i stayed at a hotel next to the milano centrale train station for convenience as i had to get to the airport for an early flight the next day i went for a walk to see the cathedral    duomo  it is impressive even without going inside  i didn t seem much else as the weather turned aside from that  i just had dinner at  ratana  which was amazing  great food and wine  i had the  milanese risotto with veal  and for desert the  watermelon granita  both were amazing  slightly pricy but worth it as my final meal in italy hope this helps someone ,0

in a tricky situation need help please,bought a roundtrip flight on priceline and used part of it already but need to reschedule my return flight for 42 days later  i was on the phone with priceline yesterday for almost 3 hours and they told me i can get a  500 credit for my unused portion of my ticket to reschedule the flight  the problem is  theyre trying to charge me  1500 to reschedule  so  1000 due after my  500 credit  i went to the priceline website to look for the same date route and its only  750 to buy a brand new oneway ticket  so at most they shouldnt be charging me more than  400  so then i thought maybe i just got a bitter rep  and called again and this time i got a drunk priceline rep working from home and  nope  still  1500  so then i called the airlinepany to see if they could change it  nope  they could change my reservation but couldnt process the actual ticketing and told me i need to contact priceline to make changes  priceline is trying to cheat me out of more than  500  i even told the priceline rep why would i pay  1000 to reschedule my flight when i can just buy a one way with the exact same route from your priceline website for only  750  and the rep said our website is negotiated prices  we re only authorized to give you retail prices  so then i went on google flights and even still the price for that route was  930 still lower than the  1500 priceline is trying to charge me  i wouldnt mind the 930  but to charge  1500 which is 100  higher than their own website prices and higher than retail price is just absurd  my return flight that i need to reschedule is in 4 days and im running out of time and no where to turn to  ive spent almost 5 hours the past 2 days talking to endless reps and this is my first time traveling international and have not much options at this point edit  i didnt mention that i was originally quoted  973 minus 500 credit to change my flight but call got disconnected with priceline rep  and when i called back within the hour  they said price is now  1500 and when i told them how in the world did the price change  100  within 30 mins for a ticket scheduled 1 5 months later  they said prices are always fluctuating  then i said fine give me another route  and the rep quoted me the same   1500 the type of ticket i have was a flexible economy ticket so it allows no hassle rescheduling as long as i pay the difference in the ticket price however the only issue is that only priceline is authorized to change my ticket and im not authorized to do so with the airline directly ,0

story time  dropping phone in river in japan ,last year i went on my first solo trip in japan  i had the time of my life  i spent 23 days in total  i went to tokyo  14days  kyoto  3days  osaka  3 days  and nikko  3 days anyway it was my first day in nikko   i was staying a pretty awesome hostel called nikko earth hostel  it was right on a river  incredible spot really  i was sharing some sake with some friends i met at the hostel  sitting on the rocks right in front of the river  i had my phone in my pocket  and all the sudden it slides out of my pocket and slides off the rocks into the river  i instinctively jumped in with all my clothes in to try to recover it  it was dark  and i could not find it  being that it would ve been broken anyway it didn t matter much keep in mind it s my first solo trip in a foreign country  let alone one with such a intricate transportation system  my phone was how i navigated the entire trip  so i was freaking out for the first day  especially because i had to somehow navigate my way all the way from the mountains in nikko  to my terminal in narita  with no help  it was definitely an experience  especially because i got sick after jumping in the river  and i couldn t hear out of my left ear at all  so i had to try extra hard to hear the train announce the stations and such i managed to make it to my terminal  and it was honestly a great and empowering experience that i was able to do this all on my own  it added another element to my trip  not constantly looking at my phone for directions  i just wanted to share lol  edit  this is the hostel i was staying at if anyone is curious   nikko earth hostel ,0

resources for travel in switzerland ,not a single trip report  but more of a collection of experience and lessons from many trips  i don t think i have posted this here before  it might be useful in this very long planning period  most of my travel here as day or week long trips has been solo travel  this is probably as safe and easy a solo destination as you are going to get  people hiking or biking across the country by themselves isonplace  eating isn t a group thing like in some countries  and other than maybe a few activities that require a booking with a minimal group size you won t find yourself excluded from anything  i have never had any problems  though as a white male it might be easier for me to avoid them  i can t speak for other demographics the only real factor for me regarding solo travel here has been that if you really want to meet other travelers then it will be much easier at a hostel in a more popular area  ie interlaken luzern zermatt  than if you go off to other forms of aodation in the lesser known regions  there are hostels all over the country  but many  especially the yhas  tend to attract domestic swiss tourists of various ages rather than an international scene  the swiss are not going to embrace you like a family member  but are friendly in their own way  i have never had a problem getting help  even without a mutual language  sharing tables at relaxed places like mountain restaurants is quite standard  once all the empty ones are partially occupied  and sometimes they will be very chatty in a way that still surprises me sometimes  speaking the local language makes it much easier to get talking with people  but english often works everywhere  too well given that i still have issues getting people to talk to me in german sometimes disclaimer  i am in no way linked to  get paid by  or benefit from anything i do on here in any way whatsoever  sadly nobody has even tried to bribe me with gifts or luxury hotel stays  this

the local languages will have far more options    i live in the german speaking area so i am very heavily biased to the sights and culture there just through my daily experience  i am a little insufferable at always wanting to be different  so i tend to be a bit harsher on populafamous places than unknown ones  you should try and mentally correct for that my own guides   my own sub   ali on

adapters   not alwayspatible  if you have an eu plug it might not fit into a swiss socket  but newer ones should do  roughly speaking when the two prongs are 4mm or less in diameter  and 14mm apart they should work in both the eu and switzerland  cable cars typically stop running at around 5pm  but can be until 10pm or so if it is servicing a village like m rren  this is especially deceptive in summer when it stays light until much later  check when the last run is  the internet is full of stories of people who found themselves with a long walk down in the dark   internet   practical many of these also have a phone app version which is worth having general   my switzerland  the official and very extensive tourism website  just about any information you could possibly need about anything is on here   wikivoyage  a bit hit and miss  the overview and coverage for places like z rich is fantastic  but many places are lacking in useful or any info    local tourist areas all have their own websites  usually in both summer and winter versions  giving you info on  conditions  what is open   ideas for what to do  etc  eg   jungfrau region   zermatt   appenzell  and so on transport  you can get regional travel passes which cover all transport and cable cars in specific areas  eg  the  jungfrau region  or the  tell pass  around luzern  likewise there are endless  passes for museums etc in each region     sbb  the website  and also app  for the train network covering buses  boats  and cable cars too  timetables  ticket info  and pass info  it is sometimes better to look up the timetable for seasonal things like cable cars and boats on their own websites  eg   bls boats on brienzersee  or  cable cars in the aletsch region  as when they don t run the sbb just gives a vague  can t find the connection  notice  they do various  travel passes  though it is best to carefully calculate your planned routes or figure out if it is worth it it is worth looking for the off peak  super saver  tickets which limit you to a certain train but can cut the price in half  and if you have the half tax this cuts the price again  to as much as 75  off    aodation  official aodation  which should include airbnb  will offer a guest card in many tourist areas including free discounted local transport and activities  typically this is just in the town village and places 10 20 minutes away  eg for interlaken    but in the beautiful and underrated canton of ticino  it covers the entire canton      aside from the standard options for finding rooms you might also want to look into other options such as   are not on booking etc and you will have to find them by trawling around on google maps  this could help if you really want to stay in a certain area but everything is booked out  but many of them have a very basic setup so you might need to phone up or fill in a form on their website  another option that might be worth considering is the  swiss hotel card    a 99chf per year subscription that offers half priced hotel rooms  this is limited to participating hotels and doesn t apply during the high season  but could easily pay for itself with just a single night or weekend  i have yet to try this  but the range of locations looks like it could be quite good for domestic travellers    for more rural hut and farm based aodation    is the best starting point  camping  standard campsites    wild camping isplex  the best way to sum it up is  prohibited but tolerated under conditions   this sac page has the most official guidelines    there are some pointers for the ideal situation  the more you follow the better  above the treeline  with theunity   landowner s permission   not in a protected area    single tent  set up as the sun goes down and dismantle at dawn  no fire noise disturbance litter  wild camping has increased in popularity in recent years   iconic spots like seealpsee are having problems with numbers    so try and pick a less known spot weather  for weather there is  search ch  which also includes a few webcams and ski info in winter  or  meteoswiss  which has a useful country map  there are lots of high resolution webcams  check official websites for resorts and cable cars  eg   jungfrau region    or  roundshot    for the best  useful webcams can also be found at  webcamforinsiders    and  swisswebcams   maps   switzerland mobility  detailed map showing all official routes for hiking biking skating  with lots of short and long suggested routes  if you sign up for the  paid  pro version then you can plan routes on the map with detailed height information and pretty good time estimates   for example     map geo admin ch   mobile app   swisstopo  the official govt map is amazing  quick to load and use on desktop or mobile  you can toggle useful overlays like hiking paths  in some ways better than mobility above as the levels are shown and the contrast makes it much clearer  and just about anything else from geological features to ski runs  you can even switch to historic versions of the map going back to the mid 1800s and watch the country grow  it will even convert any section you like to pdf for easy saving and printing  all for free  when actually out and about i tend to use  maps me  on my phone which has rather good coverage of the footpath system and addresses businesses  that said it does have some big gaps in some areas  i wouldn t use it for advanced routes  but to check my position and where a certain side path might take me it is mostly very useful  the directions feature sometimes gives good advice and sometimes decides that a perfectly good bit of path can t be used and that you should take a 3 hour detour  the time calculator does not take height change into account  so do not trust that either internet   culture   swissinfo ch  swiss news and topics in english   thelocal ch  is more of the same   newlyswissed  is yet more swiss news with a focus on cultural tips for those adjusting to switzerland  though it can be somewhat fluffy click bait  actually it is mostly pretty crap really  beer  there are apparently more breweries per person in switzerland than anywhere else in the world  the impressive one man website  bov ch  maps and is working hard to review them all  music to get you in the mood  many of the bigger swiss artists like  anna rossinelli  and  stefanie heinzmann  sing in english  understandable with a slightly bigger potential audience  but there are a surprising number that sing in swiss german  in no particular order of name or genre   bligg     where else can you see someone rapping and posing on a z rich skyscraper   kunz   nemo   lo und leduc   dabu fantastic   z ri west   baschi   patent ochsner   marc sway   de luca   m sl m   hedgehog   subzonic   span   mani matter   steff la cheffe  and  dodo  having written all that i then just found  this big youtube playlist  or if you want to go really swiss you can go fully native and crash through into the world of  folk schlager   at this point you are out swissing most of the swiss who would run up a mountain to avoid that   this however may be the peak of awful campy self aware swissness   my apologies to every swiss person who was just reminded about the existence of that  however  this    may top that to be the most amazingly bad swiss thing ever  if you speak any of the national languages then the  swiss broadcasting corporation    has plenty to offer in each  for example with german there is the srf is who do a mix of high german and swiss german telly and radio   srf play  is their on demand tv radio website and app  they are very good at putting their full shows onto youtube    the main srf youtube channel  has quite a bit of content  and there are other  specialised official channels too  radio podcasts are on  the srf website  and on spotify  and probably other places too  for swiss german check srf1  especially the regionaljournal channels  and srf3  and for the hardcore the h rspiel channel often has full plays in swiss german   i rather like the srf archive for the historical videos which can normally be enjoyed without the language books  swiss watching   diccon bewes  2010  switzerland seen through british eyes  a very readable and enjoyable introduction to the history  people  politics and areas of the country by someone who has lived there for years  ideal reading as a traveller  there are some over generalisations but given the scope and size it mostly does a good job  if you read anything about switzerland make it this   he also has a google talk video which is basically a condensed version of the book    slow train to switzerland   diccon bewes  2013  the author retraces the first thomas cook tour of switzerland and shows how much has changed since then and by the rise of trains and tourism  a very interesting read for the history and travel ideas    around switzerland in 80 maps   diccon bewes  2015 yet another diccon book  though this is much more history and culture than travel based  at a large 33x23cm it isn t travel friendly either  but it is beautifully done with a range of well reproduced images and interesting information  it is accessible and interesting to everyone  but i would say this book is most enjoyable to those who already know the swiss landscape  history and culture to some extent already  the  tedx talk  that he does on the subject is rather good  the  bergli publisher  which diccon is part of  have quite a few light hearted books about swiss culture and switzerland  how the english made the alps   jim ring  2000  a history of how the development of tourism  climbing  and winter sports played a major role in the development of the alps  not just switzerland  but it is a major focus of the book  a tramp abroad   mark twain  1880   free ebook  satirical and absurd account of his travels in europe  the swiss part is often hilarious  as above is interesting to see just how much the country has changed since then  several places such as  weggis rigi  and  zermatt riffelberg  have theme walks in the approximate places where he walked himself  a tramp in this sense is to walk  not the homeless person as most people other than the kiwis might assume  sherlock holmes   the final problem   arthur conan doyle  1893   free ebook  a quick and easy read of holmes   final  adventure ending at the reichenbach falls by meiringen  he oversells the waterfall somewhat though i must say    the magic mountain   thomas mann  1924  inspired by and set in a davos mountain health retreat  noent as have yet to read it  heidi   johanna spyri  1881   free ebook  the classic kids book which seems to be something of clich  and sales device these days  for a start you can visit a fake heidi house in heidi village  it is only partly happy alpine adventures  and often rather painfully moralistic  read until she is put on a train to frankfurt and that should be enough  william tell   friedrich schiller  1804   free ebook  performed every year in interlaken amongst other places  frankly it is really blood boring   the whole thing can be summed up that the swiss are good christian brothers  and the austrians are utter wankers  bill bryson passes through in his 1991 book  neither here nor there  while still mostly a good read  being almost 30 years old the info is rather outdated in parts  the country has be much more lively since then for a start  la place de la concorde suisse   john mcphee  1984  a very out dated but in some ways interesting read looking at swiss military thinking and culture back in the 80s  the attitudes and situation are very different now over 30 years later  this is only really worth it if you really want to learn about that bit of swiss history  it alsoits the cardinal sin of having numerous bits of french scattered about the book but with no translation provided  which is really bloody annoying if your german is good then  von casanova bis churchill   barbara piatti  2016  a series of articles about famous visitors to switzerland   the publisher emons does local krimis  if you like a nice murder or two to go with your hiking spots  the quality is good enough but the writing is not going to win any literature awards ,0

hidden gems in the netherlands ,hey everyone  i  19f  recently moved to amsterdam and love traveling around the country on my own whenever i have time  i ve already visited amsterdam  obviously  leiden  rotterdam  utrecht  delft  den haag  katwijk and noordwijk aan zee and breda  do you have tips and suggestions for places  especially less well known ones  that are a must see or just worth visiting in general  i m interested in seeing scenic areas  good party spots and experiencing different parts of dutch culture it would be preferred to be able to travel there by train or bus from amsterdam since i don t have a car  i usually go by foot but if a bike is needed in the area that is also possible  my budget is low  basically as low as possible  i would only be paying for the train bus tickets and some food drinks  if the place is further away i would consider renting an airbnb or staying at a friend s place  if i happen to know someone in the area i ve seen nice pictures of giethoorn  does anyone have experience visiting there ,0
is there a website to search boat and ferry trips  similar to searching for flights ,as the title suggests  i like to incorporate water transportation  boat  ferry  etc  into my travels  whether it is between countries  ex  ferry from south korea to vladivostok  russia  or within a country  thai islands  sometimes these options are more expensive and take longer than a flight covering the same distance  but i like to explore ideas anyway  usually to find these i have to search specific departure and arrival destinations or zoom in on google maps with public transport turned out  ferry services appear as a dashed line  or i find out about them while reading about an area  are there any websites that collect information about these routes and schedules from all over the world  or am i stuck with rome2rio searches if anyone has tips on traveling by water or routes to check out  that s cool too  cheers edit  not looking to book any tickets ahead of time  just trying to get an idea of options around the world  looks like i will have to continue relying on my current methods  though edit  a lot of great info here  this turned into a great resource  although i keep getting recs for rome2rio  which is already in my post ,0

where are the best spas  amp  thermal baths in the world ,i noticed that people on this subreddit always ask about the best hostels  best food  best bars  best nightlife  best museums  etc  but no one ever talks about the best spas in the world i think travel  amp  relaxation go hand in hand so i always try to visit some spas wherever i visit  yes  i know  as solo travellers and backpackers sometimes we try to save every penny on the cheapest flights and hostels but it s ok to splurge on yourself too  one of the most famous countries for this is hungary  szechenyi baths  gellert baths  etc  are really famous and the architecture there is just gorgeous  but what other countries have amazing spas and baths  one of my cousins visited an outdoor spa in bali  indonesia near the mountains and it was the most gorgeous thing i ve ever seen  where do you rend ,0

any tips on best routes for solo female travelling in subsaharan africa  public transport advice ,i am planning a 5 week trip next year  or later  post covid  and would like to see 2 3 countries  i love seeing nature  experience music and local culture travelling as a solo female i have questions about safety and about accessibility from my research the safest countries seem to be tanzania  uganda  ruanda  malawi  zambia and botsuana  namibia maybe ethiopia  would love to hear experiences of others who have been there and some route suggestions or other destinations to consider  as i can t see all in one trip i d either go for an eastern or a more southern route namibia for example has stunning landscapes and wildlife but seems to only make sense with renting a car as a group of friends or go with a group tour  as it s apparently not possible to reach the destinations on public transport i looked into overland tours which seem quite affordable and worthwile considering the cost of renting a car or booking safaris on your own  on the other hand i am more of an independent traveller and worry that their tight itinerary would stress me out and prevent me from hanging out with locals i meet and doing fun little detours  how hard or easy do you think it would be to do such a trip relying on public transport  i realize each country might differ  so i d be grateful for advice on any ,0

places you have visited and would not return ,for me it is cambodia  beautiful country but i had the worst time  the outright prostitution in phnom penh made me feel ufortable in ways i ve never felt in thailand  the girls looked so much younger  poorer and vulnerable than any of the girls i ve seen in thailand  i m a woman in my 20s so was made to feel extremely unsafe by the men from europe  russia  north america who were mostly overweight  balding and over 50  i had a feeling these were bad men who probably havee over for ease of access to sex with underage girls  they were criminals and made me feel sick and constantly scared  a few of them madeents towards me whilst i was alone  i could only understand the english ones but they were insulting  i feel so sorry for these poor cambodian girls  i also travelled to sihanoukville which was a dump  i only stayed a night as a jumping off place for the islands but that was more than enough  same dodgy atmosphere men with underage cambodian girls  apparently this was a lovely beach town a few years back but nothing of the sort now  litter everywhere  rabid dogs  shady characters  constant building  disgusting water  had a quick walk then straight back to the hotel before i got mugged  the islands werent bad  had a much better time on koh rong and koh toch than i did on the mainland but imho there are beautiful islands all over sea so i wouldnt see a reason to visit them again  lastly siem reap  again dodgy characters  less so and more travellers but still the feeling of ufortable every time i see a white man with a tiny cambodian girl  angkor wat was incredible  watching the sunrise over the temples was surreal and probably the highlight of my trip  however i ve seen it now and dont think i d need to see it again look forward to ur stories  ,0
solo travel has really be solo travel,i wanted to travel the world growing up  like most kids do to some extent  5 years ago  when i first got the chance to start doing that regularly  i had no idea how to travel and meet people while traveling  that didn t stop me from booking solo trips to anywhere my passport would allow whenever i got skiplagged notifications about flight price drops  i d visit places where i didn t speak the language  stay at budget hotels without any other travelers and especially travelers my age  i d walk around foreign cities in places like panama and japan  knocking out places marked on google maps  i would go days without having real face to face conversations aside from the occasional google translate assisted conversations with uber drivers  these were exciting times because i was visiting places that i had only read about in history books and i was literally living my dreams  but being a very social person who thrives off meeting people and making new friends  it was also always a bit weird  entire short trips felt like meditative experiences as i had a lot of time to spend with myself and my thoughts  i think they helped me grow tremendously as a person  eventually  i found out about hostels pub crawls free walking tours cs events and how easy it is to make friends with fellow travelers through any of those  and i never looked back  traveling and backpacking became very social endeavors  meeting people at the hostels and going out for a drink every night with fellow backpackers became a daily part of traveling  i am that guy that literally goes out every night when traveling  even if i cannot drink more than a beer because i have to wake up for a 6 am day trip  in some ways i didn t grow as much from these trips  but this was just more fun and i had no intention of going back to the solo ways now  the pandemic has brought things back to how they used to be  i just came back from a 2 week trip through all the major hawaiian islands  and this felt a lot like my first few trips to central america  sometimes i was the only guest at the hostel  i was driving around all day around the islands  almost always alone  it was surreal going to popular hikes and state national parks and often being literally the only one there except for park rangers  at the same time it got lonely  some days i woulde back around sunset knowing i wouldn t meet another person till i visit a coffee shop the next morning  just like the first trips  i had a lot of time to spend with my thoughts  i probably had more moments of deep reflection in the 5 days in maui than i did in the 4 weeks in stockholm last year  at the same time  i don t think i did anything as fun euphoric as meeting a group of awesome french guys at a techno party in zagreb and heading with them to slovenia the next day  i guess ideally i would have a bit of both during my travels  i feel like i can tplain because traveling  even like this  is the most fun thing i can think of doing right now  i will absolutely keep doing it to the extent it s safe until this pandemic ends  it s still a great time  but i also have to say i can t wait for things to get back to how they used to be with packed hostels and late nights  felt like these thoughts belong here and others may relateedit  to anyone concerned about me not following hawaii s quarantine restrictions for visitors  i live in oahu  inter island travel was allowed and considered safe during my trip  state national parks have been open to the extent they can be while enforcing social distancing measures  all indoor buildings  visitor centers and certain hikes have remained closed  even the cars i drove were picked up via non contact methods with turo where the keys were left in disinfected lock boxes attached with the window   if you can t tell from the title or the entire post  my interaction level with other humans on this trip was on par with that of tom hanks s in cast away,0
have you ever been to a country deemed as  dangerous  by most  what was it like ,i have been looking into more and more people s stories about places they ve visited alone that pretty much everyone would think they were crazy for going there or that they would probably die by doing so  but those travellers always seem to have pretty good experiences and generally love those places  this has made me feel start questioning just how much are those countries actually dangerous  i honestly feel like if you just avoid the absolute  no go  areas  have someon sense and respect the culture  you should be fine  but  i wanted to hear more from you ,0

airbnb in japan,how have your experiences been with airbnb i found an affordable one that i like  i reserved it with the ability to get a 100  refund close to the date i m traveling  if that happens  the host replied and then a co host i didn t see on the original listing replied  the cohost is a super host and the main host is new to airbnb but has two reviews from guests that seem legit and have been on the site for a while  i guess what s weird is that the co host seems to have properties that used to have listings but now are either different or they no longer have them  not sure  but some reviews mention a ghibli themed stay that i don t see there considering that the place i m staying is booked for 2 weeks in shibuya  i m kind of concerned with miniskirt laws  they have a hotel and businesses license listed but i have no way of verifying  not sure if laws have changed slightly since most articles about it are from 2018  i d like to think that airbnb does some basic screening but i honestly can t be sure i m traveling solo and would hate for something to happen  i ve considered staying in hostels but i m kind of on the fence about my desire to be around strangers for my every hour of my time abroad  i have adhd and will have to change my meds just to go on this trip  i d like to have a place to return to that isn t overstimulating but with some actual floor space and that doesn t cost an arm and a leg  i have unfortunately had some reservations rejected because this is my first time using airbnb  any advice  is this normal  has anyone experienced something like this edit  i promise i ve searched this sub plenty in the last few days about airbnb but much of what i ve found about minpaku is old and this question is specific edit 2  thank you everyone  your feedback has been incredibly helpful and reassuring  i will stick with this and see how it goes later this year if it even goes at all edit 3  i m mulling this over further but this feedback had been super helpful and i hope it helps others in the future as well ,1

best way to get to wajima,i posted my tentative itinerary for a fall trip mid to late november  a while back and i m tweaking it based on feedback i got  we will be in japan on my husband birthday so i want to do something special with him  it will be our third trip and he s expressed wanting to go to the go nagai wonderland museum in wajima but he feelt like it s too far so he didn t say anything when i planned before  there seems to be some interesting things in the area so i think we can make it worth it i m trying to figure out what s the best way to get to wajima since it s not a usual touristy spot and we ve never been to that prefecture  we will be spending 2 weeks in japan  most of the time in kansai  based in kyoto and a couple of days in tokyo  we ll probably be getting a jr pass if it s worth it overall  it should cover the trip to kanazawa from either city from what i ve found  should we  go from kyoto to wajima by public transportation all the way  and stay in kanazawa or any other neat odation in the area accessible by public transport  go from kyoto to kanazawa by train  spend a night then rent a car the next day to drive to wajima and back and sight see along the way  go from tokyo to wajima on a domestic flight from haneda to the noto peninsula airport  to avoid the 5  hour train bus rides  go from tokyo to kanazawa   wajima by public transportation any feedback is appreciated  i can also add more details if needed ,1

2 week itinerary in japan with a father  amp  his 16 year old son ,this assumes travel is safe this year i m flying my son out to japan once winter break from school starts  i ll already be there  he ll be in japan december 16 december 30  we will be using takkyubin services for every leg of our journey  when ites to food  money is no issue  i plan to eat at a good mix of inexpensive eateries as well as bib gourmand  amp  michelin starred restaurants so anything between fastfood curry gyudon to 500 dollar kaiseki meals as i d love to hear your rendations on those as well day 1  arrive   kix airport  check in to hotel in namba  ramen as a first meal and some takoyaki to share before going to sleep  days 2 3  spend the next 2 days focusing on food with no real strict plans  i want to be super flexible these next 2 days in case my son feels jetlagged or exhausted  though i doubt it  especially because we ll probably walk around a bunch when we head to kyoto  assuming we ve already had ramen and takoyaki probably aim to eat okonomiyaki  kushikatsu  kaiten sushi  have to set the bar in the event we have a proper sushi omakase experience  yakiniku  exploring namba  shinsekai  dotonburi   amp x200b kyoto  activities in bold are must dos  while unbolded ones are optional and dependent on our mood  time  etc  it s difficult to pack all of the highlights of kyoto into the next 4 days without feeling rushed and i also want to be considerate of my son who might easily get templed out  there really is no way of telling so i m trying to piece together what i think is fairly balanced and flexible and visiting temples with a lot of variety so the experiences won t all start to blend together   amp x200b day 4  arashiyama all day  i actually plan to book one night here in arashiyama and the next 3 nights in gion with the alternative being all 4 nights in gion  my reason for this is 2 fold  1 i project this to be the last night of hanatorou so i want to be in the area late  amp  2  i d like to be able to wake up early in the morning and walk right on over to the bamboo grove to enjoy it without crowds  what are your thoughts  maybe moving around too much morning  amp  afternoon  pick up rental bikes then visit  daikakuji temple   otagi nenbutsu ji temple   jojakko ji temple  and gioji temple  okochi sansho villa  drop off rental bikes then have an early dinner evening  hanatorou from 5 00 8 30   togetsukyo bridge  bamboo garden  tenryuji temple  kimono forest amp x200b day 5  nishiki market  manga museum   sanjusangendo  tofukuji  fushimi inari taisha   hopefully arrive  1 1 5 hours before sunset  would love to see this shrine with less crowds   absorbing the atmosphere of the area both with sunlight and at night when the lamps illuminate the torii  spend the evening exploring pontocho alley  gion  shirakawa  hanging by the river  also thinking of making a reservation to experience some expensive kyo kaiseki   amp x200b day 6  super flexible day  omi jingu shrine  30 60 minutes from kyoto city center  my son really wants to see this shrine because he saw it in an anime  kyoani store in neighboring uji  visiting himeji or nara   really playing this day by ear but if it were up to me  i d like to bring him to kuramadera  yoshiminedera  kokedera moss temple  maybe enkoji  not sure how it d look in autumn   sunset at shogunzuka amp x200b day 7   kiyomizudera   nanzenji   kodai ji   kennin ji  eikando  honen in  chion in   ginkaku ji  for sunset   amp x200b days 5 7 can be flip flopped around  i m just trying to avoid back to back days with heavy walking with what i proposed   i omitted kinkakuji because i think it s overrated   amp x200b day 8  have fun picking out eki ben  shinkansen to tokyo and check into aodations in shibuya  explore harajuku omotesando shibuya  i think this would be a fun perfect first day for a teenager to feel the city s energy and a nice contrast to kyoto   amp x200b day 9  christmas eve  going all out with reserved lunch and dinner  thinking of teppanyaki  omakase sushi  tempura  checking out isetan and looking for cake and trying out the expensive fruit  maybe exploring a christmas village amp x200b day 10  christmas day  odaiba all day  teamlabs borderless at opening  joypolis  fireworks  it ll be on a saturday in december so i think there are fireworks  can anybody confirm amp x200b day 11  ghibli museum  kichijoji  shinjuku amp x200b day 12  kamakura  by now  we d definitely need to return to nature  we may have visited shinjuku gyoen by this point or strolled around the park near the ghibli museum  but i think kamakura would be a nice divergence away from city life  i d absolutely love to go to nikko  but i assume it s not as nice toward the end of december  in the evening  maybe stop by yokohama  this would be december 27 so i m hoping the eateries in kamakura will still be open amp x200b day 13  make a food pilgrimage to menya itto or tomita  visit atami onsen or kusatsu onsen and spend the evening  i would really love my son to experience staying at a ryokan while being served meals in the room  also want him to experience an onsen  but he may be a little shy being naked around other people so i d like to find a room with private onsen  now  i realize i could have booked a ryokan in kyoto but that would have involved moving around a bit too much in a few number of days   i might have considered booking a ryokan in arashiyama as well  but the dinner provided would interfere with our plans to explore during hanatorou so i figured it d have toe somewhere while we re in tokyo  should i do something different amp x200b day 14  return to tokyo  visit wherever else we feel like visiting  ikebukuro shinjuku shibuya for souvenirs and anime goods  i don t think akihabara is worth it  but might a 16 year old still want to go  i m hoping nakano broadway is plenty   amp x200b day 15  december 30th  i m hopin there is still stuff open for us to do  relax until my son s flight  i plan to hang with him at haneda for a few hours before his flight   amp x200b are there any activities worth planning for in osaka is our pace reasonable in kyoto  are there temples that i absolutely missed  provided they are near the areas we ll already be in ,1
recieved gifts after eating at a small restaurant ,i have not ever gotten a gift when eating at a restaurant and i am unsure what the reason is here  no other restaurant in japan has ever given me a gift after eating the owner followed us out to give it the restaurant was great  we stood out as foreigners not close to a tourist area  but i was able to order and have conversations in japanese  we did say we wanted to try several things  and we entered because the smell was fantastic the other guests there were really interested in our opinions about the food and japan in general  and it was a lot of fun after we payed and left  the owner rushed out and thanked us  gave us gifts and seemed happy but we had a great time and the gifts are very appreciated  but i am unsure if i should do something  or if the owner felt like something was wrong i get worried because the restaurant does not have anything online  so i don t think they are looking for a good review no other place i ve ever been to in japan has done this don t know how to respond or whether i should gift giving practices in japan is something i still find extremelyplicated and i still get worried when friends give me gifts ,1
5 days in kyoto  what to skip ,planning to visit kyoto in the fall with my wife  we re looking for a mix of fun and relaxation  here s my tentative  to do  list  anything else i m missing  which options should i skip or is overrated   visit a temple or two    we re not big on temples or palaces  if you had to choose one or two  what would they be   fushimi inari shrine   hike through torii gates    does it get very crowded   shop at nishiki market    is this something that you need to spread out in multiple visits to get the full experience   monkey park iwatayama    do monkeys randomly run up to you   hot springs    are there private hot springs for a couple   wander through the gion district    sites say  wander  but what can you actually do there  also  can you rent a kimono yukata for photo ops   arashiyama bamboo grove    does it get very crowded   fushimi sake district    are there free tours w  free samples  lol  and in english too   toei kyoto studio park    seems cheesy in a good way  but is it though please no  loud nightlife  we are pretty lowkey  chill  quiet lounges or small pubs suit us best  museums  we ve done so many museums during our travels  we prefer to avoid  places to  people watch  shopping malls  been there  done that  super tall towers  from the space needle to taipei 101  the views are nice  but surely there s gotta be more interesting stuff ,1

reevaluating our cancelled march 2020 trip to southern japan for october 2021,in march 2020 i was about to go on a long planned trip with a friend  focused on kyushu and southern honshu  we had to cancel it due to the lockdown a few days before we would have departed  this was our basic itinerary  arrive in fukuoka  2 days fukuoka  2 days nagasaki  general sightseeing  maybe arita  onsen  shimabara  3 days kagoshima  sakurajima  sand onsen  maybe sidetrips  3 days hiroshima  peace park  side trip to miyajima  1 day onomichi  2 days doing the shimanami kaido cyclepath  2 days kyoto  already been there  mainly wanted to see the miyako odori  3 days tokyo  ghibli museum  showing my friend tokyo  who hasn t been there before  flying back from tokyonow that it looks like there is an end to the pandemic in sight  and since we expect to be vaccinated by mid 2021  we re reconsidering doing the trip in autumn  october  of 2021  we re considering already booking some hotels  with free cancellation  soon  as they still seem to be quite cheap to book right now  our itinerary was created for spring  with following the cherry blossoms in mind  is there anything you think we should change considering the change in season  are there any events or festivals around autumn in southern japan that we shouldn t miss we re also considering extending the trip by maybe a week or so  including a side trip to yakushima  are there any destinations along the way where you would rend spending another day  we re mainly interested in traditional culture  but also natural sights  more obscure suggestions are definitely wee   as long as they re reachable by train ,1

how bad is the humidity in japan during the summer ,hello  i was planning a solo trip to japan sometime in 2022 for 2 or 3 weeks most likely either in the summer or winter  but i m not sure which weather conditions are better  i would ideally like to go in the fall  but i ll probably be busy attending university during that time  since we usually have a fall semester from last week of august to a week before christmas in december  and then a spring semester from end of january to end of may  so  realistically i only have a break from june to august and january to be able to visit my focus is on summer  but i heard the humidity is pretty bad  i ve grown up and i m used to living in the low deserts  summers where i live  get up to 120 f  48 c  or even up to 128 f  53 c  every year  but i ve only ever experienced dry heat  and it s really rare for it to be humid  so  i m not exactly sure how bad the humidity is  since i ve never really experienced it before  what should i wear as a female  or what should i bring to prepare myself just in case i choose to go in summer usually dry heat where i live is just scorching pain  so it s more advised to wear long sleeves or long pants over shorts from my experience to avoid getting burned or staying indoors for the most part  since it s easy to get dehydrated if i were to go in the winter  having grown up in a desert  i ve never seen snow  and the coldest it s ever gotten was around 50 f  10 c  so this might not seem as cold to those who grew up around snow  but this is pretty chilly to me lol i m also worried about typhoons  because i ve never experienced them before  so i m not too sure what to do in those situations  i m not too sure on what to wear around snow if i do go in winter some itineraries on my trip involve a lot walking   not in order   is this doable to walk around outside in summer or winter  i m also going to use a jr pass  hiking either on mount takao or mount koya  hiking up fushimi inari shrine in kyoto  hiking the kurama dera mountain temple trail  the arashiyama forest and the surrounding shrines and temples around there like the otagi nenbutsu ji temple  kimono forest  etc   a day hike  visiting other temples and shrines  tokyo disneysea or disneyland  universal studios japan in osaka  an aquarium and ferris wheel in kyoto or osaka  tama zoo  saw that it was pretty big  didn t want to support small zoos like ueno zoo  gardens like imperial east gardens and meijiro garden  using the  osaka amazing pass  to visit attractions like osaka castle and hozugawa kudari or hozu river boat rides  riding the sagano scenic railway  kyoto   hot springs onsens  hopefully view fireflies  walking to a lot of sightseeing attractions  hoping to also visit a festival if i can  kamakura enoshima island beach  day trip  nikko  day trip  nara  day trip   if i have time  hiroshima miyajima island  akihabara and pok mon center  full shopping day   i m a big anime  manga  and video game nerd lol  harajuku shibuya  fashion and item shopping day   i don t mind that harajuku is a bit overrated  i ve always wanted to go at least once ,1

ramen streets,i travel to tokyo fairly regularly  2x year    last visit was this february right before global shutdowns  i normally stay right by shinagawa station  which was great because of the convenience of shinatatsu ramen street   fantastic for a late night supper after dinner and drinking  i heard recently that the area has undergone quite a change due to construction  renovations    the ramen street and the food basement of the wings department store closed down so  curious to hear what some other collections of ramen shops exist  besides the one in tokyo station edit  appreciate the responses about other cities  but i was thinking within tokyo ,1
things to do in yamanashi on new year s eve   new year s day ,hi everyone  i was just wondering what there is to do in yamanashi on  new year s eve and new year s day  i m assuming most things will be  closed  and i want to avoid restaurants  amp  bars due to covid   any  ideas  i have a car and can drive so transportation is no problem ,1

is hiking the nakasendo trail  from kyoto to tokyo  ill advised in the summer  july august ,hey guys  a few months ago i read this article by a guy who basically walked all the way from kyoto to tokyo  without trains transport etc  i ve been fascinated by the concept ever since  that said  in the article he mentioned cherry blossoms  so i think that he did it in march   here s the article for anyone interested   i was wondering  would this be possible to do during the summer  i work as a teacher  so summer is when i get the most days off  i d hope to stay overnight at hotels on the road while trekking  but i keep reading about the heat in the summer  i live in the uae so at some level i feel like   okay  so what  but i ve never been to japan so i m very likely underestimating it  is hiking walking at all possible in the summer   kyoto to tokyo i m also wondering the logistics of this  as the entire walk would take a good 4 5 weeks or so  would i be needing to book like 30 hotels in advance for every night  would i be able to waltz in  and find a place  or should i be carrying a sleeping bag with me  if anybody has any other suggestion as a long distance hiking trail that would allow me to both enjoy nature culture  i d appreciate it i d be solo travelling  male  25  i would appreciate some insight into this  thank you ,1

planning a solo two week dream trip to japan   rendations for a few things please ,i ve got a major milestoneing up in 2021  and to celebrate i m going to spend two weeks in japan on my own  probably going in 2022  if i m being honest   but the celebration will be booking my dream holiday  for background  i m a white british woman in my 30s who speaks about three japanese words  but is eager to learn a few japanese phrases and try them out   i m also happy with google translate  i ve never travelled solo to another country before  i was therefore hoping for a bit of advice on a few things  i know about the jr pass  etc  as i ve been reading around the sub  i m particularly excited about the food  so experiencing as many different japanese foods as possible is one of my main priorities  i m looking to avoid western experiences  but happy with touristy things   my budget is tbc  but in my head i was thinking  2000 2500 for the whole trip  which is around  2650 3350 usd atm  is this a realistic budget  considering flights from the uk are usually around  1000 for a return journey   i m spending two weeks in japan  i definitely want a full week with kyoto as my base  and will go to various places from there as well  osaka  maybe hiroshima  i don t want to move around bases too much  so i m looking at another full week somewhere else  maybe  the obvious place is tokyo  but i m not a massive fan of big  busy cities  for example  i hate london  but other uk cities are fine  however  i also want somewhere where i can travel around easily  there s things to do  and most importantly  lots of japanese food to eat  i ve been thinking maybe ishikawa  do you have any rendations   i ve noticed i can get package holidays including a hotel for the same price as the flight themselves  so basically free hotel  this idea doesn t thrill me  as i would really love a two location holiday  but it looks like it would be saving me something like  500  the hotels look like quite western styles  which i gather is a bit rubbish sometimes  what alternatives are there  i know about ryoken  too expensive  airbnbs  tempting  i ve used them in the past and love them  and hostels  never used one  not a big fan of the idea of a shared room  and i need somewhere secure to leave my suitcase and belongings  what do you rend for a solo female traveller ,1
2nd trip november 2021 for koyo and seeing the japanese alps,this will be our  married couple in our 30 s  second trip to japan  our dates are nov 10   nov 28  we primarily enjoy searching out less known attractions and did this to some success in kyoto on our last go around  our goal this time is to see the fall colors in japan  which is why we put the alps first in our journey  leaving kyoto and tokyo for the end  and explore regions we didn t get to see last time  we have strong interest in food   drink  japanese culture  and avoiding crowds  we generally are early risers who are able to be on the go for the entire day  we don t typically spend much time in our hotel  we like to have a good plan for the day  but we don t overdo it so that we are not rushed and can explore things that catch our interest along the way  looking for advice on if this is a sensible route and if we are spending too much time in takayama  wondering if anyone has suggestions or advice for our first half  which is the most travel heavy and new to us  would also ask if there are decent spots for another onsen dip along our route after we leave the alps  yes  shirakawago is missing from the itinerary  we are going to see the hida no sato folk village near takayama as a substitute because we just aren t too interested in crowded bus travel and the over touristy vibe we get from shirakawago  we instead plan to take the hida wide view from takayama to toyama to take in the views   amp x200b nov 10  arrive in narita at 3pm and head into tokyo to recover nov 11  tokyo   another relax  recover  explore daynov 12   tokyo  gt  nagano city  the plan is to spend the day in tokyo and head to nagano either in the evening or afternoon  our main attraction to nagano is the togakushi shrine  which we will be doing early in the morning the next day  i understand the jigokudani monkey part has hit or miss monkey sightings during this time of year  either way  given the difficulty of access and lack of interest we are not sure it is worth it  nov 13  nagano   matsumoto  we plan to get up quite early and have a friend who will be driving us from the city to the togakushi shrine path  we are very excited  we understand this hike take a few hours    interested in exploring obuse afterwards if time allows  possibly jigokudani if we make excellent time  evening train to matsumoto to enjoy castle at night and dinner  nov 14  matsumoto   hirayu onsen  we will be staying in a onsen ryokan this night  our matsumoto interests  in order  are going exploring the castle  taking a sake brewery tour  the matsumoto city museum of art  and the wasabi farm  we are notitted to doing all of these activities as we understand that the bus to hirayu takes 1 5 hours and we would like to reach our ryokan before nightfall  nov 15  hirayu onsen   takayama  breakfast at the ryokan and the the 1 hour bus to takayama  arriving before noon  alternatively  we may head to takayama in the evening after visiting kamikochi  coincidentally  this is the last day of the season at kamikochi before it closes for the winter  we are not sure if it will be  worth it  at the time of year as we understand it will be quite cold and the fall colors fallen  however  we are enticed by the idea of being there  and on the last day to boot nov 16  takayama  we will have most of the previous day  if we do not opt for kamikochi  along with this day for the following interests  hida folk village  sake brewery tour  morning market  higashiyama temple walk  perhaps biking to furukawa if it is not frigid  nov 17  takayma   kanazawa  we will be taking the hida wide view train to toyama and then hopping on the shinkansen to kanazawa  we have not decided when to head to kanazawa   early if we feel we happy with takayama  later if not  nov 18  kanazawa  kanazawa is less fleshed out  we want to take a slower pace and enjoy the area  of course kenroku en  the modern art mustum  nagamachi  omicho market  kanazawa castle  we understand that kanazawa has an interesting bar scene due to the university presence  we are also interested in kanazawa sushi given it s proximity to the sea and that we will be there in the winter crab season  nov 19  kanazawa    fukui    osaka  this day we will either spend in kanazawa and head straight to osaka  or try to visit some sights in fukui  specifically  eiheji temple  hakusan heisenji  and the dinosaur museum  being by far the least important  ever since seeing hakusan heisenji i have wanted to visit  unfortunately  it is not that easy to access  the plan would be to leave kanazawa in the morning  visit eiheji  then head down to katsuyama city to see heisenji and the dino museum  then we would head back to fukui station and head to osaka  we understand this would be a long day and we would just head straight to hotel in osaka  nov 20  osaka  do whatever we want  dpress  eat  maybe go to the suntory distillery  nov 21  osaka   kyoto  day to either bop around osaka  maybe head to kyoto  or do a side trip like uji  nov 22  kyoto  hope to wander around kyoto and find lesser known  less crowded  spots to enjoy the city  interested in uji  kurama kibune  ohara as well  nov 23  kyoto  same as above nov 24  kyoto   tokyo  shinkansen to tokyo nov 25  tokyo  enjoy tokyo  nov 26  tokyo  see above nov 27  tokyo  see above nov 28  tokyo   fly home thanks everyone ,1

other than expense  are there any major drawbacks to structuring travel around shinkansen access ,as we all know  shinkansen are expensive but they are fast and travel through major destinations of japan different types of shinkansen stop at more stations  giving you accuracy  technically if you had unlimited shinkansen access it would be easy to travel a lot of destinations in japan quite easily in particular if you stayed at takasaki  saitama  fukushima  or morioka  you d have a chance to access travel on shinkansen in three directions i can imagine some drawbacks would be  that there s so much to do and that is accessible in japan  that you can travel by local transit to experience japan anyways it seems like such a convenient option  are there any other major drawbacks edit  concern from a resident  but applicable to tourists,1

my bad experience with japan rail pass  beware before buying from them,prior to this pandemic  i bought a jr pass from japan rail pass  unfortunately the pandemic happened and i had to reschedule all my plans  so i called them and the agent said that i had two options  get a refund and losing 15  of the total amount or getting a new one by paying only 5  of the total  i decided for the later one  but i had to send it back to them until the end of july in june i went to the post offices in brazil and they weren t allowing me to send anything abroad  i then send and e mail to japan rail pass explaining the situation  the agent  this time a new one  didn t quite understand  i explained the situation  another agent picked up the conversation but told me it was ok  i could send as soon as possible and he understood that we re going through though times every month after that  i went to the post offices to mail them my jr pass and would immediately e mail them saying that i still wasn t able to send it back  i would get an reply saying it was ok  every time from a different agent two days ago  november  i finally managed to send my jr pass  so i called them and spoke to rosana  i don t know if she s a normal agent  the boss or something  but she was extremely rude with me  she kept raising her voice and telling me i didn t understand the situation  she also said that i could only get a refund by paying 15  because i wasn t able to send it back to them until the end of july  i calmly explained the whole situation again  then and only then she agreed that there was the possibility of paying 5  for a new one  but she just said  well  that s not my problem  you didn t send it back in time she also said that i should ve read the e mails they sent to their customers  which i received none i tried to speak nicely to her  i explained the whole situation  explained that i wasn t able to send it back to them because the post offices weren t allowing it  but it didn t matter so  before you buy from  japan rail pass  consider other options  even though they were the cheapest option  their customer service is all messed up  every time i sent an e mail  i would talk to a different agent  although it was all in the same mail thread  i had to explain over and over again just so you know  15  is around u 120  which is equal to r 650 00  the min  wage is r 1k  so it s a lot welp  that s it  idk if anybody has any suggestion on where to go from here aside getting a new jr pass from somewhere else  but that s my story  beware when you buy from these guys ,1

oimachi alleyways,hello  how realistic would it be for me a person with less than a zero understanding of japanese culture and language to travel to tokyo for 14 days only to explore the oimachi alleyways  relevant contextual background here is that i became interested in the aesthetics of tokyo the art  architecture ercial design  the overall  vibe  of being immersed in the place  thus  there isn t one  attraction  so to speak  that i would want to see  i quite honestly believe i would be as interested in the car park at nakano station as i would be exploring don quijote or shibuya station  both as interesting in their own right  i hope what i haveunicated is that the culture and aesthetics fascinate me in general  i suppose my question might be better broken into itsponent parts  would there be enough alleyways in oimachi to necessarily require 14 days  presuming  of course  i suppose that i would be moving slowly  read  old  and  myplete non understanding of japanese culture notwithstanding  exploring shops and eating to a certain extent along the way would this be safe  i question whether i would be an easy mark for someone who could use my lack of awareness against me if this idea i have proposed is bonkers  does anyone have an itinerary for someone who would like to explore tokyo on foot ,1

can deaf people drive in japan ,so i m deaf and considering visiting japan next summer  assuming all goes well with the virus  i plan on visiting tsushima island  hooked by ghost of tsushima  but the website rends that i rent a car  but i remember hearing that japan doesn t allow deaf people to drive  is this still true  on another note  can i even rent a car in the first place  i have a us license  but will this enable me to rent a car  assuming japan now allows deaf people to drive edit  i really didn t expect this to attract so much attention  i thank all of you for the wonderful help  i m getting more and more excited for my trip to japan  and for future redditors who happen across this post  yes deaf people can drive in japan  we ll need to get an idp  an international driving permit  and buy an aurally impaired sticker in japan  a magnet with a green circle and a yellow butterfly inside  and put it on the back of whichever vehicle we re driving ,1
trip report  november 2019,i didn t get around to this right after my trip a year ago  i figured i would post now as there have not been many recent trip reports  it was my wife s  38f  first trip to japan  i  42m  had previously traveled there on business  so i was excited to go as a tourist and have my wife travel with me friday  november 1   flight and arrival to tokyo flew on united via denver  used miles  this was the first time i went into the united club in denver  i thought it would be nicer  it was just a small buffet of snacks and chili and some places to sit  left in favor of just waiting near our gate anyway meal on the plane was not very good  tough over salted chicken with thick sauce  other than that  flight was ok saturday  november 2   tokyo arrived at narita late afternoon local time  picked up pocket wifi  took train to tokyo station  and a cab to hotel moxy  made this hotel choice due to having marriott points which went the furthest here  room was real nice  if a bit small  expected for tokyo  neighborhood was a red light district  but didn t seem unsafe  saw some drunk japanese salarymen  and the bar area of the hotel was full of all blacks fans  which i learned is the new zealand national rugby team  ate some flatbread  had some drinks  and enjoyed not being on a plane while the rugby fans watched the rugby world cup championship game  which was held in tokyo that night sunday  november 3   tokyo ate breakfast buffet at hotel   took jr to yoyogi station and walked to meiji jingu i was aware that there would be a festival  and it was the culture day holiday   we made sure we arrived early  jet lag also helped with that  but i didn t realize the importance of the exact day until we got there   this was the 100th anniversary of the dedication of the shrine   we really enjoyed the walk through the inner garden  so i would definitely rend doing that   there s also a really nice gift shop walked to harajuku  my wife bough morefortable shoes at a skechers   we proceeded to takeshita dori  browsed the shops  bought some things   we ate lunch at a gyu katsu restaurant which had 6 ways to dip the breaded beef into different sauces  rubs  or egg yolk   we then took a cab to shinjuku  which i called using the japan taxi app   we looked for some type of bar where we could have a drink mid afternoon  but everywhere to get a drink seemed to be closed   i guess day drinking isn t a thing   we didn t look too hard   we settled for coffee and then took a train back to our hotel we tried a few restaurants around our hotel which looked mostly empty  but we were refused   perhaps they did have reservations later   we walked back to our hotel and got a rendation  then walked over to fillet bar  located near kinshicho station  the server grilled our yakiniku beef on a small grill on our table  it was excellent  and the restaurant had a decent selection of wine  and was reasonably priced   our server told us she didn t like japanese food herself  and prefers to eat american and french food   she rended a french restaurant for us to try the next night monday  november 4   tokyo breakfast at hotel again   today was an observed holiday  culture day  so most japanese were off of work   we met a tour guide  tours by locals  at iidabashi station and proceeded to koishikawa korakuen gardens  the imperial palace gardens  naritasan fukagawa fud d    a buddhist temple with a fire ceremony  and then senso ji   we had gyu katsu for lunch again since we liked it so much the day before  i highly rend the koishikawa korakuen gardens  it s a beautiful japanese garden near the tokyo dome  the fire ceremony was cool  but it was still sitting through a religious ceremony where we didn t understand the language  we left after the fire ceremony portion  senso ji is must do for your first trip to tokyo  it was the best place for souvenirs  and the temple is just iconic  i also rend stopping by the tourist information center near the asakusa metro stop  it has a small viewing tower from which you can view senso ji and asakusa  and it s free took the subway back to iidabashi station and walked to kugurazaka  tokyo s little france or little europe neighborhood   there was piped in french music and french bakeries and french and other european restaurants  but other than that seemed like a normal part of tokyo  a good break from the more touristy areas   we did find a wine bar for day drinking   ate dinner at bistro le parisien   good french restaurant    tuesday  november 5   tokyo last breakfast at hotel   took subway to ueno park  walked around  walked through a district of kitchen supply shops  and a lot of music shops   don t remember if we made it back to a subway or just walked  got over to jinbocho  browsed the book shops  mostly the ones with english language books   ramen for lunch   subway over to shinjuku  and toured the samurai museum   although really touristy  the samurai museum was fun and worth checking out   we had yaki niku in shinjuku for dinner and then saw the robot restaurant show   do not plan to eat at the robot restaurant   show was wild   wednesday  november 6   iwakuni checked out of hotel   hotel moxy had very friendly and helpful staff  but decor was trying a little too hard   especially inon areas   we woke up super early this morning and flew ana to iwakuni   i got this flight included for what our miles covered with no additional fee   some fairly new united program at the time  i believe   would have flown to hiroshima  but it wasn t available  so i got the next closest airport   we saw the kintai bridge  and walked around an area with old samurai residences  several parks  temples  a japanese garden  and then took a tram up a small mountain to iwakuni castle   this was a neat day we would not have done except for how the flight worked out   we then took a train to hiroshima and a cab to ana crowne plaza  booked with ihg points thursday  november 7   hiroshima started the day at shukkeien garden  this fairly small garden was absolutely beautiful  with many different japanese garden elements worked in   if you are in hiroshima  i really rend fitting this in   it s really a gem   after a nice walk through the garden  we walked over to hiroshima castle   there was a spot in the castle where you could dress like a samurai and take a photo   we then saw the atomic dome  walked through the peace garden  and went to the peace memorial museum   definitely worth doing  but be prepared to be upset   feel just awful emotionally   we walked around through the peace garden some more  then made our way to okonomimura  which i very highly rend   it s a building of several  4 or 5  floors of about 8 to 10 okonomiyaki stalls   there s a big sign near the elevator as you enter with some english language descriptions of the type of okonomiyaki sold by each shop   we picked one  and it was great   cooked right in front of you and served right away   delicious and like nothing else   friday  november 8   miyajima we took a train to miyajima and the jr ferry to the island   ate some oysters   saw a lot of tame deer walking around town   torii gate was under scaffolding  unfortunately   got an idea of what it would look like anyway   toured the itsukushima shrine and daishoin temple   saw hundreds of cute little buddha statues all wearing knit caps   thought about climbing mt  misen   decided to have some beer at the miyajima brewery instead   headed back to hiroshima earlier than anticipated   got a little rest before going out for shabu shabu    saturday  november 9   himeji   kobe checked out of the hotel and took a shinkansen train to himeji   toured himeji castle and koko en garden   definitely rend  making it to himeji to see this castle if you can   we also enjoyed walking through the garden   had ramen for lunch   took a train to kobe   got tired of hauling our luggage around   if i did this again  i would have forwarded our luggage from hiroshima to kobe using a service rather than carry it ourselves  incl  storage locker at himeji  etc   got to kobe and checked in to the ana crowne plaza kobe for one night  ate kobe beef and propeller restaurant   very  very good  and much less expensive than i was thinking it would be   sunday  november 10   kobe had breakfast at our hotel  then walked just out of our hotel  and just past the shinkansen station  and right out of the city and into a trail up a mountain   just a short hike and it felt like you were miles away from the city   saw several beautiful waterfalls   turned around  walked back and got a cab to meriken hatoba for lunch  this kobe beef was beyond excellent   chef spoke to us and posed for a photo with us   also  not nearly as expensive as i anticipated   cab driver didn t understand our destination and dropped us off at meriken park  but it wasn t far  so we walked and weren t late   we walked around china town after lunch   then we picked up our bags from the hotel and took a train to kameoka via kyoto   we had booked a two night homestay in kameoka for something a little bit different   these were among only a few nights for which we did not use hotel points   our host cooked us dinner   included tuna   it was very good   monday  november 11   kameoka in the morning  we did a seven temples walk through a much more rural area than the rest of trip  if i remember right  kameoka means  turtle field   we had ramen for lunch   my wife bought several vintage kimonos at a shop in town for a fraction of what you would pay in tourist shops in kyoto or tokyo  we then did the hozugawa river boat ride on the oi river  which starts in kameoka   at first  we were a bit underwhelmed  but quickly you get into much better scenery   the guys running the boat spoke only japanese  but i don t think we missed much not understanding their banter   we enjoyed the scenery   towards the end  another boat docks with yours  and you can buy food and drinks  but it s right at the very end   it let us off in arashiyama  kyoto  in a prime spot to walk through the bamboo forest   i enjoyed that more than i thought i would   it was not too crowded   we took a train back to kameoka   our host cooked us sukiyaki for dinner   tuesday  november 12   kyoto we said good bye to our homestay  took the train to kyoto  and dropped our luggage off at our hotel  a traditional ryokan in central kyoto   we purchased a 48 hour pass to a hop on   hop off bus   we walked over to nijo castle and went on a one hour guided tour  in english   i do rend doing the guided tour here as we learned a lot that we otherwise would not have   we took our bus over to near kinkaku ji   we had reservations for a traditional japanese tea ceremony  which we very much enjoyed   we then toured kinkaku ji  headed back to our hotel  and walked over to gion and found an italian restaurant for dinner   it was very good  but we were the only diners    wednesday  november 13   kyoto saw daijiin  sanjen in  and obai in temples   took the bus on nearly the full circuit this day   also did a guided tour of nanzen ji temple and other temples in that area   fall colors were beautiful   our guide told us one of the gardens in one of the temples we saw was almost empty most of the year  but people specifically came to that one just for when the leaves are red   had pork tonkatsu for dinner    thursday  november 14   kyoto started the day at ginkakuchi  higashiyama jisho  and then took the philosopher s path south  past the temples we saw the previous day  got on the bus and headed to kiyomizu dera and rengeoin sanjusangen temple   picked up our luggage at our hotel  in hindsight luggage forwarding service would have saved us the trip  and took a shinkansen to tokyo   saw a lot of temples in kyoto over 3 days   nearly all with beautiful gardens   a bit of temple overload  but it s a trip to japan   i was ready for a change of pace and heading back to tokyo  but i was quickly realizing that we were almost done with our trip   arrived in tokyo and checked in to the intercontinental tokyo bay   used ihg points   friday  november 15   tokyo headed to odaiba   had time to shop at the hello kitty store before our ticketed time at teamlab borderless   enjoyed teamlab borderless  but to be honest  it was a little underwhelming with all the hype it gets   it s still worth doing   did some shopping around odaiba   had dinner at an amazing teppanyaki restaurant in ginza that i cannot locate any longer   we had more kobe beef   much more expensive than in kobe  but excellent   one of the best meals i ve ever had   saturday  november 16   tokyo last day in japan   went back to senso ji and bought lots of souvenirs at the shops   bought a lot of kit kats of unusual flavors   had some ramen   took a train to narita and flew to denver   immediately had mexican food at the denver airport  i hope to get back to japan someday   i had a couple business trips and trips to see family within the us in late 2019  but i had no idea that i wouldn t leave my metro area in all of 2020   memorable trip   glad we did this in 2019 ,1

help choosing a spring or fall festival ,i ve been looking up the different festivals but i m kinda stuck on it  i wanna try and go in the spring or fall since i don t handle heat well   i get headaches very easily   looking them up tho  i don t know which is best to go to  some of the big ones look fun but i m autistic so huge crowds can cause a bit of panic and loud sounds set off my headaches as well  i was going to base my trip for a date that could match a festival   no year planned out yet though   but i wanted to ask too are the festivals worth it  from what i ve seen they look fun  i m just worried i ll struggle with it due to sensory issues and social anxiety  it s something i ve wanted to try for years so maybe if anyone has any advice or experience with spring fall festivals and what ones are fun but maybe not too huge  or are they harder to track time wise then if they are smaller  i m sorry  i hope i ve provided enough info ,1

bicycles renting options in and around kyoto for 1 3 weeks,hi all i am looking for places options to rent a preferably touring bicycle in and around kyoto or osaka  ideally i want to go on a bicycle tour for a couple of weeks  from kyoto to hiroshima  my questions are   are there any places which rent out bicycles for touring for couple of weeks without it getting more expensive than buying a 2nd hand bike    if these places can have different drop off points  rent from a kyoto   drop off at hiroshima  then that s a huge bonus too  or should i just buy a used bike instead and sell it to a used bike shop when i am done   for both of these options what should my budget look like to do it cheaply but not too ufortably if you have done touring bikepacking or cycling trips around this area please share your experiences from your trips or any hot tips about how to do it the when of the trip is still undecided but if things start resembling normalcy then september november  2021 thanks ,1

 challenge  traveling all 47 prefecture in 1 month,in the near future  i m thinking of trying to visit each of the 47 japanese prefectures within one month  i will of course probably spend time in multiple prefectures in one day and may treat some with more attention and others with less  the question i want to ask here is     which cities should i stop in the prefecture     which prefectures should i spend more time in     what traveling method can i make it very affordable and i guess i should probably add more info such as when i m making this trip  or what would i be interested in seeing for the trip  or quite frankly a question for me is why i m making this trip  well for now just ignore that  because i want to hearents and suggestions from  you  what places did you like  what places did you want wish to go  what place was the most memorable or horrible  i want to hear your stories on which places to visit and why amp x200b for specific information about the trip  here it is   it ll most likely be after this covid 19 situation  hoping for summer 2021  and will probably start somewhere from the kanto region  ig tokyo because it connects to anywhere  some possibilities i have are fly from tokyo to hokkaido okinawa and going south north from there  along with flights  i will most likely use the jr pass for cheaper prices and would probably spend half the trip like a homeless man and not stay at a hotel  this might be a bad idea  there s also some prefectures where i have my mind visiting such as kanazawa  ishikawa or amakusa  kumamoto  but this can change because i bet some people here would have better locations than mine  i hope  for destinations in the prefectures  i really don t mind if it s a bustling city or a historic town filled with shrines and temples  or even a countryside village where normal tourists wouldn t even go to   if it s a destination that you ve been to interests you and have a good story about it  let me know amp x200b update wow  i did not think this post would get this much attention on this subreddit  reading theents  i understand this is a bad idea bc 1  i won t be able to experience all the places in japan properly2  waste of time and waster of money3  traveling in the summer is  yeah few things i do want to clarify is that i m a japanese american student  i can speak japanese  i ve been to japan multiple times throughout the past years from kyushu to tohoku  and while i did say i m interested in going to seeing destinations  i will most likely give less importance to cities prefectures i ve already been to such as tokyo  kanagawa  saitama  chiba  ibaraki  tochigi  fukushima  gunma  nagano  toyama  ishikawa  gifu  aichi  osaka  kyoto  nara  wakayama  miyagi  fukuoka  oita  and miyazaki  when ites to this travel  i understand more than likely  50  of this trip will be spent on traveling  which i m fairly happy with that  who doesn t love spending hours onboard japanese trains  when ites to eating food and taking a break  i really don t mind if i spend 90  of this journey eating tsunamayo   at some convenience stores  i did that during most of my 2019 summer  lol  and while from an outside standpoint  this idea is pretty dumb  personally  i ll be treating this trip as a way to aplish my grandparent s goal of traveling across the country now based on theents  the moston advice was  don t do this trip in the first place  fair enough  but i think i m too deadset on making this trip one way or another that i probably won t think about stopping  logistics wise  i should probably plan this once i get my driver s license and also maybe not during summer where the weather is awful  it s hot and moist  and there s going to be lots of tourists japanese folks on break  as other people have pointed out  i should more or less stay at a hotel or as one specifically said a capsule hotel which is cheap  i should probably scratch my trip happening in summer 2021 cause it ll be a hard stretch  based on how much i have right now  another big thing that people brought up was  what s the point of traveling to each prefecture if i can t even spend half of them relaxing and thoroughly experiencing what they have to offer   now i could spend a year in japan  or maybe even a decade exploring what the country s riches have to offer  but that amount of money you would need to invest up for a trip like that would be enormous  let alone for a month long trip  my logic was that i should try to do a cross country trip  in the shortest amount of time possible  which based on theents would probably be better for two months all in all  though  thank you to everyone who looked at this question and anyone who will look at it in the future for your inputs and advice  for the people who said don t do this trip  i ll try to think about it  but i can t guarantee you all i won t do it though  for the people who gave some names of cities and prefectures  i ll give more research about those places  for the people who gave criticism about logistics  much obliged  i ll try to plan out this trip differently  again thank you all for theents  and now  time to do some replying  d   another update   why is this getting so much attention   i noticed lots ofents on why not to do this trip or why this trip is a bad idea  but for new people who want to add on to this thread  instead of more  don t do it s  can you add suggestions on what would u do  even if you can t do this within a month s time span  how would u tackle traveling across the 47 prefectures in general    another thing is i don t think anyone here has actually traveled 47 prefectures  or if they did  but not within again that said month period  how long did it take  or did you just travel all the prefectures by coincidence  more feedback is appreciated ,1

sightseeing cities with trams  trolleys  etc ,i would like to see cities through above ground transport  preferably open air trams  trolleys  etc  i understand not every city has this  i am deciding between the cities to the north of tokyo  and the cities south of hiroshima  is one region better than another for above ground open air transport  ,1
fall foliage questions,hey all still tentatively planning for a 14 20 day trip  probably not til 2022 at this rate  with my family  and i wanted to get some feedback on fall colors in japan  we re probably going to start in osaka before moving to kyoto for at least a week  if not more  then on to hakone for some r and r  before ending in tokyo  i d really like to make sure i catch some good fall colors while i m there  as here in florida  we basically go straight from summer to the dead of winter  i think this means i ll have the best chance of seeing good colors if we leave around nov  20th and keep moving east  at least according to this year s various fall foliage forecasts  but i d like some particulars i couldn t find much info in english online about 1  how is  peak foliage season  defined for  say  kyoto  is that when the leaves are at their most vivid and populous  what would kyoto look like before then  mostly fall ish but with specks of green 2  how long  approximately  does the  peak  last for  are we going to have to hustle through kyoto if we wanna see fall colors in hakone  or are we good for a week and a half or so if we wanna take our time 3  my fall color highlights hotspots are  himeji castle  kiyomizudera s nighttime fall illumination  and an outdoor onsen in the sengokuhara district in hakone  any immediate red flags that crop up with my desired dates  like  is himeji far enough from kyoto that the leaves will be gone by the time they ve peaked in kyoto ,1
rendations for stops on the route kyoto  gt  sendai  gt  tokyo during sakura season ,i am currently applying for a visa to work in kyoto for eight weeks starting february 2021  if possible  i d like to travel afterwards for two weeks  from march 27th to april 10th one place i d love to visit during this time would be the kitsune mura in miyagi prefecture  so a four day stay in sendai would be a fitting option  additionally  i d like to end my vacation with a five day stay in tokyo from where i will fly back home  there are a lot of things i d like to do during the remaining days  like staying at an onsen town or visiting the izu shaboten zoo close to mount fuji  but i don t know how well these activities fit in the schedule and route  so i wanted to ask  do you have any rendations for places to visit on this route  i am not really that fit  so i would like to avoid especially strenuous hiking biking trails  but i am willing to hike a bit for nice views like waterfalls or volcanic valleys  since my driving license is not valid in japan  it would be best if all locations are accessible by train  i have a rough budget of 200 000 jpy  not including the flight i hope my post doesn t violate rules 2 and 3  so please tell me if i should provide additional details  any input is appreciated  and i am looking forward to yourents ,1

optimizing nikko multi day trip,leaving for nikko on the night of 10 22 anding back 10 26  which gives 3 full days and part of monday for some laid back  sightseeing  i m sure it s a bit unpredictable with goto and covid but i m trying to arrange it to avoid traffic jams as we ll be taking buses around the area  along these lines 1  since our round trip is for 5 days  i m planning to get the  premium nikko kinugawa tobu free pass  anyone have experience with this pass in particular or rendations on how to maximize its value 2  our hotel is fairly close to central nikko so i m leaning towards doing the temple sights on saturday  since we can get to them early  and doing okuniko stuff on friday to avoid the bus traffic  anyone have any past experiences with this during this time of year  i know to expect some delays for buses  but are these on the order of minutes or hours 3  i haven t seen anything indicating major closures or changes because of covid  but what things can you imagine being betteworse under the current situation ,1
accessibility planing,hello  my name is david  my brother and i areplanning on going to japan sometime in mid spring  however  we have some added challenges because i am in a wheelchair  our main plan is to go to okinawa to visit family for a few days  next we are going to tokyo to visit the main islands  i have read that there seems to be a lot of handicap accessible modes of transportation  that being the train and possibly rentable cars on the main islands  however does this extend to okinawa  i would prefer to take my power chair  it is larger though it can do more  the only downside is that it weighs about 300 pounds  my other option would be to bring scooter  a lighter 3 wheeled chair that the elderly often use  it is light enough to be picked up  and is thinner than the power chair to go through tight passageways  although  the scooter has a harder time going over rough terrain  and is unable to raise me up so that i might see people at eye level  whereas the power chair can  my main inquiry is this  is mainland japan accessible for power chairs  is okinawa accessible for power chairs  and if so could i bring my power chair or would it be better to bring my scooter ,1

overnight onsen day between tokyo and osaka touring  kinosaki or hakone ,hello all we re in the early stages of planning a 2 week vacation for autumn 2021  tentative  the current plan is to spend roughly one week in tokyo and one week in the osaka area  we d love to have a  relaxation day  in between at an onsen ryokan kinosaki appeals to us because it looks like a more  all inclusive  experience with the ryokans offering an included onsen pass for all the hot springs in the town  plus the area itself looks lovely  but hakone also looks very nice  if a bit more spread out  it s also less out of the way than kinosaki and has more to do  although we don t know how much we ll be taking advantage  since the plan is to veg out what are your experiences with both of these towns  or is there a dark horse third choice we should look into  thanks for your help ,1

is there a place to put your stuff while visiting fuji national park ,me and some friends are planning an itinerary and after we re done in tokyo we want to take the shinkasen to kyoto  however we wanted to stop in fuji hakone izu national park and do a little bit of hiking around along the way they re wanting to visit the fuji five lakes which is a bit further away from the tokaido shinkasen than the hakone area  but what i was wanting to know is if there is somewhere you could store your luggage while you re in the park i ve heard of people visiting the park on their way to kyoto  but where would you put your stuff  otherwise it seems like it would be a day trip from tokyo and then you would go to kyoto the next day ,1

wondering about salespeople scammers in odawara,i went on holiday to a japan last november with my bf  and on my way from hakone to tokyo stopped off at odawara to see the castle  worth saying we are white and had a suitcase with us  so we were obviously tourists while we were there  we were approached three separate times   once at the castle  once at the seafront and once at the train station   by pairs of women  each time two women approached us holding a tablet asking if we coulde with them somewhere because they wanted to talk to us  we don t speak any japanese and none of them spoke that great english so we weren t sure on the details of what they were asking realise it was probably people selling a sightseeing trip or similar  but it was such a specific set up and it only ever happened in odawara  anyone know what this was  and if it son ,1

garage sales in japan ,i live in a part of western europe where village wide garage sales are frequent and some century old flea markets still operate  it s always fun to rummage through the clutter and find something unique for a few bucks  i m a vintage vinyl records and video games collector  so i try to go as often as i can my question is  is there a similar tradition in japan  of course there are plenty of high profile record stores and game shops in tokyo  but it s not as fun   and not as cheap   as garage sales  if there are  i d also like to know if it is considered acceptable to bargain in such situations  it s a given that buyers will try and negotiate where i live  but it might not be the case in japan thanks ,1
ryokans without onsens ,hi  everyone  i m dreaming of my next japan trip in the next few years and looking to forgo my shoestring travel ways and splurge on a nice  traditional ryokan for 1 2 nights  the catch is that  due to an old injury  onsens and submerging in hot water hurts a lot  i learned that the hard way at my last onsen trip  perhaps there are bargains to be had in onsen less ryokans  can anyone rend ryokans that are really unique or a great value  that would be worth it for me  bonus points if they serve amazing meals and can be accessed by public transit location doesn t really matter the plan is to take the train all the way up the country for a few months to see scenery and small towns   i imagine being in a small town in the mountains is a better value than in tokyo edit  it would be for my husband and me  so 2 people  it seems that most ryokans cost around  150 250 per person  so  300 500 night  is that right ,1

dewa sanzan alternatives ,i m interested in doing the hike through dewa sanzan  but i d also like to visit japan for hanami  or possibly in winter  when 2 of the mountains would be closed  the hike through the forest on haguro san looks like a fairytale  but it s also pretty far out of my itinerary  lots of train changes  just to visit one mountain  does anyone know areas that look similar to haguro san  especially the cedar forest  where i could do a day hike that may be more accessible ,1
old trip report   may june 2016   24 days,part 1so i was going through old emails and pictures and found detailed writeups that i sent a friend of mine during our 2016 japan trip  my friend had never been to japan and knew nothing about it  so  i ll edit  condense them for clarity  as i got into some pretty basic explanations that i m sure a lot of you have figured out already  don t think too hard about the dates timeline  as i condensed and sometimes didn t have time to tell friend about things until a few days later  so the emails backtrack to previous days a few times  we were planning on going again this year or next year with our toddler  but alas  pandemic    covid 19 having slowed down content on this subreddit  i figured some people would still find this a fun read we did a 4 person trip  myself  my husband  b  my sister  s  and her boyfriend  k  for 24 days  sharing aodations and fair bit of food transport costs  depending on what we were doing     we ended up realizing that increasing convenience orfort generally didn t cost a lot more than the cheapest options  so we often paid an extra  5 8  night to get a business hotel instead of a hostel   we also opted for the

  tokyo no email report  as i was too tired flew into narita  negotiated our way to the skyliner without tooooo much difficulty  and met up with my sister and her bf at hotel horidome villa   prettyfy little business hotel  and we had two adjacent rooms  we were a bit tall for the beds  b is 5 11  and k is 6 1  but it wasn t the end of the world   my husband could almost span the room with his arms    used the tokyo subway tickets that came included with our keisei skyliner tickets to get around    first experience of japanese 7 11 and ended up bringing an entire bag full of snacks back to our hotel room to try  which we ate while watching iprehensible japanese tv  then fell asleep day 2  tokyo    first email we walked around for nearly 8 hours and holy crap  i am looking forward to soaking in the tub in our room  despite the bathroom being so tiny  the tub is actually big enough to aodate my thighs  which is more than can be said for the one back home    i m not a skinny person due to jet lag  we fell asleep around 8pm last night and i woke up at 4 am    b  always sleeps longer than i do  so i basically read for 2 hours  waiting for him to wake up   then we went to the gym  we have an anytime membership  and they weren t kidding  you literally can use it anywhere in the world  there s an anytime fitness about 6 blocks from our hotel     we walk in  and about 4 old japanese men who were on the machines just stop and stare at us as we walked past them they try to be surreptitious about it  but it s a constant thing    i make a point of catching their eyes  and they quickly look away  then try to sneak another look  and then get embarrassed because i m still watching them with raised eyebrows     me and k got the worst of it later in the day  because i was wearing a red dress  and k has visible tattoos the red dress thing was a surprise  because i had no idea that japanese people really only wear like 5 colours when out in public here in tokyo   black  navy  white  pale blue or beige    the school uniforms tend to be one of these colours and most men wear black or navy business suits of varying formality literally  every person we saw who was wearing a different colour turned out to not be japanese   either we ended up hearing them speak a different language  or they were obviously tourists     i knew i was already going to stand out  having red hair  but this was a bit ridiculous first thing in the morning  we went out to a breakfast place that served american food  bubby s   despite being advertised as a family restaurant  the mug s drank coffee out of had a caption of  f king fresh  on it   it took us quite awhile to find it and after that  we decided that 7 11 breakfasts were the way to go  both convenience and cost wise k also had a hilarious mishap in the morning while snapchatting with his mom  which i will copy paste his own words note to self  be careful of the angles when snapchatting pictures of yourself in a japanese robe with a beer  a few degrees can change a photo from g to 18a justwantedacoolangle   sorrymom after breakfast  we went down to shibuya  which is where the giant 6 way cross walk is that you often see in pictures of tokyo    since we had been up so ridiculously early  we had missed most of the morning crowds up until this point  but once we hit shibuya  rush hour was in full swing  people were 7 9 rows deep on the metro platforms and it was sea of dudes in business suits    people didn t quite have to be pushed onto the trains by white gloved attendants  but it was a close thing   gaijin perimeter was in full effect though  and people avoided standing near us a lot of the time   we wandered around shibuya for about an hour  venturing off the main shopping street into the twisty back alleyways    at one point  we found about 12 love hotels in three blocks we also found what i like to call  the saddest playground in tokyo  featuring  ptsd panda  and mr  tiger after the huge crowds in shibuya  i was aching for some quiet  so we headed to the  imperial palace gardens  however  we made a wrong turn  and went half way around the grounds in the wrong direction  so we didn t get to see the public gardens  by the time we realized our mistake  we had been walking for 25 mins and were at the opposite end of thepound it wasn t a loss though  because the exterior of the palace grounds is still really cool    i only got a couple pictures of the walls and guard towers  but it was eerie how perfectly manicured all the plants and grass were    we wouldn t put it past the japanese imperial household to clip the grass by hand  you know  it had that kind of feel to it    we don t know if it was the case  but everything was utterly perfect looking after the imperial gardens  we came back to our hotel room and i passed out for about two hours   it was only like 3 pm  but we d been walking around since 8am  plus i had done a run  so my feet were killing me after my  utterly delicious and much needed  nap  we went to the tokyo skytree  we got there right at sunset and it was gorgeous    it was really crazy to see how far the city extended   literaly  buildings as far as the eye could see  it was an overcast day  so the mountains that surround tokyo were not visible one thing that surprised me about tokyo is it s not as dense as i thought  it would be  everything ispact and small  but it s rare for a building to be over 12 stories   6 8 stories was more likely  except for some of the government buildings and just right around the main metro stations  it was more just endless amounts of urban sprawl     i ve had tokyo described to me as a  dirty great city  and that seems to be the truth   it s just a huge city that goes on for miles and miles    but because the metro system here is so extensive  you can cross it in like 40 mins  no problem  the metro system is super easy to get around   i barely remember any of my japanese lessons  but didn t really need them however  i did make one embarrassing flub   i mixed up the words for  this is  and  where is     kore  is this is and  doko  is  where is    so i confused several station attendants when asking for directions   imagine a foreigner marching up to you and saying  this is the ginza line  instead of  where is the ginza line      i asked three station attendants and a police officer this before i figured out my mistake and they all gave me looks like i was crazy day 3   4  tokyo   kyoto ok  i m awake now  slept 11 hours  jesus christ    i have walked more in the last three days than i have walked in months  good lord i forgot to tell you about a funny part of the  tokyo skytree    they have a fucking window cleaner musical    they have a performance of window cleaners projected onto the windows   the actors  thankfully  are not outside the 900 ft tower  where they sing and clean the windows in a synchronized fashion  then all march onto the floor with a brass band  i wish i was joking  i couldn t understand a word of it though  so i have no idea what they were singing about exactly after that we went downstairs and explored the mall underneath the skytree for a few hours   it was actually a lot of fun and we found a  store pletely devoted to cheese   best  cheesecake  i ve ever had as for yesterday  we got up and and took the metro out to shinjuku  where our friend s hotel was   we were meeting up with some friends from china remember how for day 2  i said that we hadn t quite gotten to the point where white gloved station attendants were pushing people onto trains  well  i had my first experience with it yesterday    the train was packed  we squeezed on  and about ten people got on behind us   there was an awkward pause as you realize the doors weren t going to close unless something was done    i was already half buried under b s armpit  with my opposite arm and purse buried between two tall  for japanese  business men  with another dude glued to my back   then the shove came and i was knocked into the two business guys  i wasn t even holding onto anything  the crush of people held me upright for about five stops  which was all kinds of no fun  because you can guess at the sort of momentum that the train drivers have to deal with when braking and accelerating with a packed train like that  everyone got pushed around and elbows in places that you don t want elbows as the train stopped and started when we got to shinjuku  it was pretty different from where our hotel was  we re in nihonbashi  lots of wide avenues and modern development  the suited japanese businessmen were still everywhere    our friends  were staying in the shinjuku washington  and they reported that their hotel room  despite being much newer  was no bigger than ours we wandered around shinjuku looking for breakfast  and our friends  both being chinese  and thus indistinguishable from the japanese  were shocked at our gaijin perimeter abilities  the crowds parted in front of b like sailboats dodging out of the way of a tanker  and giving him the same sort of wide berth  to the point where some people were stepping out onto the street we found a ramen place called ichiran which had decent ratings  it was also very much the sort of place that drunk people would stumble into during their walk of shame  everything was designed so that you could have minimal interaction with other human beings   you ordered your ramen from a ticket machine  and then there was four bar style rows  each with a little cubby that shut you off from your neighbour  though the cubby walls could be folded away   you pushed the ticket through a small bamboo screen and you were handed back a preference sheet that you ticked off   how spicy  how rich  what type of noodles  what veggies  and you returned it through the screen  minutes later  a bowl of ramen ordered to your preferences would be pushed through the screen     you could literally aplish all of this without saying a single word and the server was never visible   at most  you saw their hands through the screen   perfect for anyone with social anxiety after that  we headed out on the jr lines to  tokyo disneysea    you heard that right  disneysea  not disneyland  they are adjacent park  but the major difference is that disneysea serves booze  not that we had any  booze was not immune to disney prices   on a purely artsy level  disneysea was awesome   everything was gorgeously and meticulously decorated    while walking through  king triton s castle as opposed to the sleeping beauty s castle that you d find in the regular disney parks  we noticed that every single tile in every single mosaic was in fact engraved with pictures of ariel  flounder and prince eric  not the same picture either   different poses and positions   there was a huge steampunk flavour to the park too     everything was pretty to look at and the amount of detail was insane it was crowded though and the rides were ok  we only went on about 6 of them  but they were fun  again  more just from the artsy side of it  i would say it was worth what we paid  but only just barely    i will say this though  when set free from the uniform requirements of black  navy and beige  normcore  colours  according to my sister  that s the name that s used for that type of fashion  japanese people seem to have terrible taste in clothing    lots of mixed neons and plaid   i also got an extremely awkward sunburn  because i under estimated how far the neckline of my dress went down and didn t put on sunscreen that far down       it itches  the sun here does not play around  we had to buy 50spf  sunscreen  which is everywhere  thank goodness we got home and passed out super quick last night  this morning  we woke up early and packed up our room  because we were heading to kyoto today   so  eight hours later  we are now in kyoto kyoto is crazy different from tokyo big difference    the japanese business suited business man haspletely disappeared    now there s people walking around in actual kimonos  we saw no kimonos in tokyo  none     oh  and people are wearing colours  actual colours we booked out of our hotel around 10am and dragged our suitcases over to tokyo station  which was around 20 minutes away on foot  not bad at all  but it was a hot day    also  the bank of japan headquarters looks like a fortress and there is one office building just before the station that is entirely covered in roses   we re talking a 6 storey building pletely covered in roses  it was pretty cool tokyo station is just nuts  there are 24 platforms  both local and shinkansen trains  it is a white tiled rabbit warren    b and k s gaijin perimeter was invaluable when we were rushing through the crowds to catch our train there was also a mall beneath the station  and much of it was devoted to different stores that featured a particular character    japan has a tendency to make a cutesy character mascot for everything  literally everything every prefecture  every city  has a character mascot  most of the bigpanies have them    some of them  like domo kun have gotten extremely popular  others  like snoopy  have been taken  bastardized  and then grown into something that bypasses all of their origins    there were  of course  stores dedicated to these two guys  and several others as well  my favourite was the studio ghibli store  obviously there was alot of specialized food places  of varying quality  including a standing sushi bar   the shinkansen train was really new experience for me  i ve been on really fast trains before   i ve been on the tgv trains in france  but i was really too young to remember much about it     however  shinkansen bullet trains are pretty ridiculous  in a very cool way first  they re extremely long   about 16 cars  of course  our reserved seats were in the very last car  so we had to hike down the platforms with our bags  about 200 m and it was very very crowded they re arranged pretty much like an airplane  with overhead and under seat storage and similar seats and once you actually get going  you don t really process how fast you re going  unless the train passes really close to something      most of the scenery passes much like it would if you were in a car  but when something passed by at less than 5 m  it was literally so blurred that you could not distinguish what it was    several trains passed us on the adjacent track and you could not even distinguish the windows   the japanese countryside is really neat    everything is really dense  and then there s wild countryside    they don t really do  suburbia  in the sense that north america does  there was very clear demarcations between human habitation  farmland and wilderness  and you didn t see much overlap    the mountains here are gorgeous  but wayyyy smaller than the ones back home  they seem gentler too  but it s hard to say  because i don t know what japanese hiking habits are we went by mount fuji too  upon reaching kyoto  it was much hotter and much more casual  as i mentioned earlier  the business suits have disappeared and everything is older and feels more organic  so to speak the townhouse were are staying in is extremely old and has tatami flooring  and we re sleeping on futons as well  there s a supermarket 1 block away and we had a lot of fun attempting to decipher what the hell different foods were  sometimes my ability to read some kanji helped  but most of it is a mystery  because japan tends to favour cutesy drawings over pictures of products on their packaging     also  vegetables and fruit are very very photogenic here  apparently  japanese people are willing to pay a lot of money to eat  perfect  looking foods  the carrots we bought were fat  bright orange and perfectly shaped  that was the only option  same goes for every other veggie we could find we also had a super awkward moment when we discovered that japanese supermarkets do not give you bags  b and i bought a basket worth of food  then discovered that we had no way to carry it home easily   so we opted for the most ridiculous route  and carried it all back to the apartment balanced in our arms  people were openly smirking at us  but oh well  how were we supposed to know   p super tired today  so we re having a night in  s  k and b have been drinking the super cheap alcohol that you can buy in the supermarket   we ll be going to bed soon  because we re boring like that  amp x200b day 5  kyoto we rented bikes foruting around kyoto  kyoto is full of contradictions  the locals bike everywhere it seems  except on the actual designated bike lanes  but you would not believe the glares we get when we ring our little bike bells to get wandering japanese obasans  old women  out of our way  because they re in the middle of the bike path   there s also signs everywhere that tell you where not to park your bikes   only to have half a dozen bikes parked in front of them we rode up and down both sides of the kamo river  which is in the middle of kyoto   and there were a bunch of hawks and cranes up and down the river  the hawks were fighting quite low to the ground and nearly buzzed b at one point  later on  we saw them steal a sandwich out of a girl s hand   she burst into tears and i don t blame her   i worked with birds and that still looked terrifying   i should also note that it s fucking hot out   the airbnb we are renting has 2 bedrooms but only one of the bedrooms has a c    so all four of us are crammed into one room on futons because the other room is enough to make anyone melt    we ve been using the other room as a  dressing room  and keeping all our bags in there day 6  kyoto so i have a massive case of bike butt right now as in  i ve been on a bike for more than 20 hours in the last three days  and i have a seat shaped bruise on my ass  i wish i was joking still by far the best way to get around kyoto  and the cheapest   we only paid about  45 for a two week rental  but jeez  you pay for it in other ways   p i m going to be sitting funny for a few days today was a lot of fun   we went out to arashiyama  biked to nijo jr station from our airbnb   about 22 mins  then used jr pass  which is a district on the far side of kyoto from where we are staying  we re in gion  which is the famous geisha district   did you ever hear of the book movie memoirs of a geisha  that s where it s set    arashiyama is a gorgeous area  with steep mountains and these really beautiful gorges  it started raining like crazy  so we didn t go on the scenic train like we had been planning to  but we visited the monkey park  which was a lot of fun japan only has one species of monkey   the japanese macaque  they re not very big   they d be about knee height on you  but they have red faces and red butts   they re the ones you see in pictures sitting in the hot springs  the ones at this particular park are a part of a study group and there s about 130 of them    the monkey park is also a 20 minute hike up a mountain  so it has a gorgeous view of the entirety of kyoto   from the opposite perspective than the one we had at kiyomizu dera  which i will tell you about in a bit we hiked up to the top of the mountain  the monkeys were mostly just laying around and  chilling out  some were grooming each other  and a lot of the younger ones were running around playing  they re right underfoot  you weren t allowed to touch them or crouch down to look at them  it s a dominance thing apparently  but they were super chill around humans and only avoided direct contact one of the cool things you could do up here was feed them    y100 yen got you a bag of apples or nuts and you could feed them at a designated feeding station  where they ll take the food right out of your hand they would crowd around and i got really lucky  because the macaque that came up to me to take the apples was a  mother with a very young baby    he was so tiny  about 7 inches long  and was clinging to her belly and nursing as she ate the apples   pletely adorable  i also got pictures of her letting him  wander  around and  explore  later   we came down from the monkey park and mostly just browsed the tourist shops  because the weather was so bad and sat in the the covered  foot bath  at one end of the high street kiyomizu dera is about 35 minutes south of our airbnb by bike  and it was a pretty cool ride until the very end   we managed about a quarter of the hill on our bikes  then had to walk up the rest of the way   the temple up is a narrow street lined with shops and there s tour buses everywhere  so walking ended up being safer   we really enjoyed wandering around the temple   it was crowded  but not claustrophobic and the view over kyoto was gorgeous   there s tons of little side paths and little grottos that are sort of lurking around the main temple and  pagoda  so you can spend quite a while just wandering  we checked out the shops on the way back down the hill and it was super nice amp x200b kyoto we got up super early and went to the  aoi matsuri festival   15 minutes bike ride from our airbnb  i m not entirely sure on the origins for this one  it s one of the oldest ongoing  festivals  in japan   about 1100 years  but it s very sombre  it s a processional from the kyoto imperial palace up to a temple about three kilometres upriver  and apparently it was originally done to appease the gods after a series of disasters at that point   all the costumes are modeled after the heian era  about 900 years ago  and everyone carries hollyhock branches and the processional attendants carry an unmarried woman who was chosen as  saio dai  through out the procession  basically a priestess who leads the appeasement rituals generally  the saio dai has to wear 12 layers of robes  it was about 27 c yesterday  i m surprised she didn t melt it was interesting to watch from an anthropological standpoint  everyone was wearing shoes made of reeds  but there was nothing to really engross the casual observer and we couldn t understand the chanting or the loudspeaker announcements at all   we left after about 40 minutes  as there was precious little shade the funniest thing we saw was that someone in a security guard uniform was basically in charge of making sure the processional s horses peed into a garbage bag instead of onto the parade route afterwards  we biked around several of the temples just north of our apartment   a lot of them are world heritage sites  and very beautiful  but kyoto is very much a place where there is a temple on every block  so you have to be picky about the ones you go to  they were all beautiful and serene  but there weren t many differences between them   after that  we biked down to kyoto station to get some ramen from the ramen alley  35 min bike ride straight down the river pathway  then across     in the station  up on the 10th floor  there is a section with 12 little ramen shops  each with a different style of ramen    s and k went to a ramen place elsewhere in kyoto and ended up getting ramen that was wayyy to spicy for them  so they were in a lot of  ah  difort this morning   we ve been taking it easy the last few days  as we haven t been getting much sleep  the person we re renting an apartment from didn t really give us good futons  so we ve been pretty much laying on the hard tatami  thankfully  the problem was sorted today and i hope tonight we can get a good sleep amp x200b kyoto so  since i ve always wanted to try on a kimono  but lacked the funds to get one of my own  they cost about  5000 minimum  due to the amount of embroidery they often have  we went to a kimono studio most of the people walking around kyoto are wearing yukata instead of kimono  most good yukata will still set you back about  200 though   but we ended up getting nice cotton ones from a cool 2nd hand shop in downtown kyoto   we still use them as our summer bath robes so i was looking for places to rent them from  there s plenty  but i also discovered a place that will dress one up in a full kimono  as well as put on all the traditional geisha makeup  my sister wanted to try this too  so off we went the day before yesterday    it s a little three story studio several blocks south of where we were staying  that called itself the  maiko experience  despite the good reviews  i thought it might be touristy  but the clientele was about 50  japanese as well    several older japanese ladies were in the make up and dressing rooms with us turns out that being belted into a proper kimono is not something you can do yourself  i had some vague ideas that you needed help to do it properly  but it s often a two or three person job   we were put into makeup first  traditional maiko make up is where they paint your skin and neckpletely white  with the exception of a small area at the back of your neck  because apparently it s erotic to have a small bit of skin showing through layers of white paint    the white makeup feels pretty much like paint but they basically buff you non stop with a powder puff to get it to smooth out and cover everything  including the entirety of our lips the eye makeup wasn t too different from what some people would do   red pink shading around the outer eyes and black kohl liner  which shows up quite dramatically against the white face paint     what was weird to me is that she spent several minutes painting my eyebrows red  then overlaying it with black kohl     the effect was very interesting though  and one i saw it properly after she was finished  i figured out what she was going for   it makes for a far deeper and more subtle look than just putting black would have done  just black would have made me look like i had huge black caterpillar eyebrows    adding the red blended the whole thing with the eye makeup and added a lot of depth  which is a weirdent to make about eyebrows     the lips were the most annoying part  if you ve ever seen pictures of traditional geisha makeup  you ll notice that they often only paint one of their lips fully  usually the bottom  and only a little line or a half done on the upper    this is because if you actually painted your entire lips with a white face  you d end up looking like a ridiculous clown i don t have resting bitch face or anything  but my default expression is definitely not a close lipped smile  which is what the make up artist required to apply the lip paint    i had trouble keeping a close lipped smile while concentrating on keeping everything else still and  in her very meek japanese way  i could tell she was annoyed with me  because every time i concentrated on keeping still  my mouth would return to a neutral position    either way  it came out crooked and it caused a flurry among the hairdressers later when they noticed it and swooped in to fix it they don t torture you by doing your hair in the geisha hairstyles  which were usually expected to last for days  so they have a half wig that theyb your hair over and paint black after that  you pick what kimono you want to wear  i went with  pink  my sister chose blue   and  you get strapped into them i m not even joking  it s like getting trussed up into a corset     there s about three layers of underwear  and while my sister had no problems  her shape being more similar to the typical japanese woman  i could tell my boobs were giving the dressers trouble  lots of untying and rearranging of padding  before being tugged tight again  apparently they try to make you cylindrical shaped before they even put the kimono on    no buttons or anything   everything is held in place by cotton cords    still pretty merciless on the breathing though after satisfying themselves with the undergarments  and they are not sexy undergarments   we moved onto the kimono kimonose in one standard length  and the dresser folds them up to match your height  so this caused another problem  because all the padding they had put underneath to even me out had to be rearranged so that i didn t look pregnant when they folded up the kimono layers     by the end of it  you are trussed up so tightly that you are forced to have good posture and can t really even bend at the waist too good   all bending over is done with the knees however  that s half the pleasure of wearing corsets anyways  your back is forced to be straight  which alleviates a lot of aches  so it wasn t that bad we were taken for a couple studio pictures  then given ten minutes to take our own pictures  b noted that he barely recognized us through the make up and we took a couple  funny  shots  as funny as you can get with your movement restricted like that   while wearing okobo sandals  which you should google  they re as hard to balance on as they look   after washing off all the make up  also a lengthy process  we had a pretty quiet day in  as we have been going full speed for the last several days yesterday  we went down to osaka  we were late starting out  so we didn t get to do as much as we wanted  but we took the shinkansen down and went to the kaiyukan aquarium  which was extremely impressive  it s a 7 story structure  and all the tanks are layers so that as you walk down through the aquarium  you re encounter the same tanks  but at different depths   there s also a massive  9 m x 34 m x 40m  pacific ocean tank  that takes up the majority of the middle of the building  it s about 4 storeys high and actually contains a whale shark  the only one in captivity    half of the walkways have windows that open out onto this tank  so you could look at it from different perspectives  we also got to watch several feedings  though as per usual  everything is in japanese  so we have no idea what the trainers are actually saying after the aquarium  there s a giant ferris wheel thing that s 112m tall next to it  so we went on that  which gave us a pretty cool view of the city    osaka is much denser than tokyo  with taller buildings  but spread over less of an area  it had way more of a  crowded dirty city  vibe too  we might go back to check out osaka castle kinosaki onsen    days 9 10 good lord  did i ever get massaged into submission  and not even by anything alive  our  hotel  room in kinosaki had a rather frightening but extremely effective massage chair  as it  it was so effective that you had to make sure the massaging bits didn t push you right out of the chair before it was finished turning you into mashed potatoes   it was an impulsive trip   we didn t even know kinosaki onsen existed until we were in kyoto a few days  and decided to spend an overnight here   we left our suitcases at our airbnb in kyoto and just took a small bag each with toiletries and a change of clothes   it was worth keeping the kyoto airbnb  because it meant we didn t have to haul heavy bags around when we were exploring also  kinosaki is probably the my favourite spot of our vacation so far  not only did we have amazinglyfortable beds  there was seven different onsens  hot spring baths  within walking distance of our hotel   i know you re a loving connoseur of hot water  so this place would be heaven for you  basically  this was a town devoted to multitude of ways that you can douse yourself in hot water   do you want it hot enough to turn you into a tomato  check    whirlpool jets  check    outdoor hot pools set under a tumbling waterfall  check    stone benches to sit on with hot water running down the backs  check    outdoor hot pools in rock lined grottos  check  steam rooms  check   free and unlimited access to seven onsens that offer these diversions  check     generally  your onsen fees are included in your hotel cost plus  the hotels provide you with  yukata   light kimono  to wear while wandering around the village  and you can move freely between onsen while they re open  it s extremelyfortable and makes everyone look colourful we had a lot of fun with it  and like all japanese bathhouses  nudity is a given     other than that  my sister and i got stared at a lot there  sort of like how it was in tokyo   lots of side eye and awkward looking away when i caught their eye     the best example was when they started laughing at something i did by accident a bit of background   when you go into the bathing area in the onsen  you re only allowed to bring one teeny towel to  cool  yourself with  you re also not supposed to leave it laying around  so most people just fold it up and set it on top of their heads  there s variations of course  but generally  it s just sitting there not being used to this  i would usually forget it was there and drop it in the water whenever i tilted my head     after this happening three times  i ve finally managed to keep the awareness of keeeping my head level down to a science  then i started sneezing randomly while sitting on the side of the bath   violent huge ahhhchooos  shit  there goes my towel  i snatch for it  fumble  and manage to catch it just before it hits the water  all of the ladies in the tub burst out laughing     they re not laughing at me maliciously  it did look pretty funny    but i was in a corner  not really in the middle of anything  they were all watching anyways k and b had a very different experience   basically any tub they sat in  all the japanese guys got up and moved to the other tub amp x200b see part 2 below,1
hot air balloon in kanto area,hi everyone  wanted to ask for some rendations for hot air balloon experience in kanto area  i have heard of one in saitama  2h  for 15 000  and in hakuba  5mins for 3 000  is there anyone who has tried either one of them  or any other spot would also be good ,1
yokocho  ok for families ,i apologize in advance if this is a dumb question  we re looking to visit japan for the first time in june  i m not familiar with the yokocho scene   i was hoping to go to some for lunch during our trip but was wondering if it s generally frowned upon for families to do this  is it safe or too seedy  will they serve children  are these looked at more as bars or equally as hole in the wall food stalls  specifically i was wondering about omoide  shinjuku  nonbei  shibuya  gansen  sapporo  daimon  hakodate  and hozenji  osaka  yokocho  if these are bad ideas for families  is there another type of eating option i could look for where we could maybe find the same type of  traditional  atmosphere  i d like to avoid chains and western options  if possible ,1
shukkeien v s  kokoen,hello all  i m fleshing out a trip for november of 2021  my original  short october 2020 trip was scrapped due to everything and i now find myself with more time to plan a much longer trip  this specific question may seem odd but hear me out  which garden would you prefer to visit  shukkeien or kokoen  i have 2ish hours set aside on my himeji hiroshima day for a garden visit  am doing a second day for miyajima hiroshima  half a day is too short for hiroshima for me  i can t figure out which one would be better to visit so would love opinions from people who have been to both  as far as i can see so far shukkeien pros    larger  convenience of getting to hiroshima earlier  less crowded   for koyo viewing pictures amp x200b kokoen pros    photos with himeji castle in background  if finished early  can possibly explore inside the castle  better koyo viewing spot amp x200b these assumptions might be totally wrong  i don t know  there is also the option of doing kokoen during the day and then shukkeien at night apparently   would it be a shame to miss it during the day  thank you for your advice ,1
tokyo shrine rendations for 13 day trip including kansai,hello folks my fianc e and i had been planning a trip to japan  i m currently in ireland  she s in thailand  yay long distance relationships  and we have usually met in person twice a year  video chat does wonders to curtail loneliness  we had initially planned something like 8ish days to visit osaka  kyoto and nara  but that trip is being pushed back to next year if travelling is safe  currently we have a switzerland trip planned if it ends around july  or an october trip to japan if the former is not open by then  this is for 2021 we re looking to go by end octobestart november  first part  we plan to land in tokyo and explore from there  the only thing planned at the moment is akihabara  because of anime  duh  she s loved inuyasha for a long time  i also got her into aot  and i ve been a long time anime fan  and me surprising her with a trip to a department store so i can get some mikagi ichigo strawberries  actually  does anyone know what time of year they are available  would they be there octoberish  other than that  we re looking at stuff like shrines  temples and gardens  possibly castles if there are any in or close to tokyo  not too too interested in museums or anything of the sort  food s definitely a target for us too  naturally  what are some good shrines to visit  i researched online but i don t really recognize any of the names  next  a night stay in hakone at a ryokan for a private onsen  we want to check out the national park too for some activities or hiking   possibly a second night  unsure  our plan is already set for there  third part  osaka and kyoto  we already have plans for temple and shrine visits  fushimi inari  kiyomizu dera  bamboo forest  yes  i know  the tourist traps  as well as universal studios  possibly a trip to the kaiyukan aquarium in osaka too  we d leave the country from osaka as well my question is  how long to spend in each region  i think a night or two in hakone is set in stone  and we re leaning towards spending more time in kansai region than in tokyo  we re thinking maybe 4 nights for tokyo  and 6 for the kansai region if it gives you an idea  our previous switzerland trip was interlaken  grindelwald  zurich and lucerne  we like the landscapes  a bit of hiking  and the old towns in cities  in switzerland at least i can speak the language  that s not the case in japan though so we probably wouldn t go to more remote places  thank you for any suggestions ,1

kyoto activities for 6 year old,hi all we re planning a weekend trip to kyoto and looking for fun non temple garden activities for a 6 year old  we re aware of the railway museum  the zoo and the aquarium  a huge outdoor playground would be ideal  found   on that topic  but if there s some other nice outdoor activity in around kyoto  would love to know too thank you ,1
suggested prefectures cities to cost efficientlybine with tokyo ,hi everyone  my best friend and i are planning for a two week autumn trip to japan when travel is possible again  and we re looking for ideas on cities and places  to pair with tokyo  for context  we are both  30yo and we have both been to japan multiple times  kansai  kanto  chubu  kyushu for me  kansai  kanto  hokkaido for my friend  we both like exploring districts  visiting temples and museums  and are also both casual anime fans  we also generally travel on a mid range budget tokyo is pretty much set as we want to see halloween at disneyland  return to ghibli museum  and return to ikebukuro  we ll probably spend 5 7 days there and take the usual yokohama side trip and maybe a fuji san side trip now we re looking into possible places to pair with tokyo area that s cost efficient  meaning can be visited with some regional pass that isn t the nationwide jr pass  now i d love to return to chubu  my favorite region  especially if the ghibli amusement park opens by then  but i think it s a different jrpany operating there so a regional pass may not be possible  it seems that there s a pass that connects tokyo to tohoku  but is it worth a full week  maybe more or less even  what are some highlights for you guys who have been there thanks ,1
looking for activities in osaka,i am planning an itinerary for my solo trip in japan  year not defined  probably spring season  the trip consists of the probablyon tokyo osaka kyoto route  but i am rather interested in other lesser known activities in osaka specifically  what i already have  umeda sky building  osaka s aquarium  amp  ferris wheel  osaka castle  central osaka  like dotonbori  etc the last item is meant to cover the walk around and explore the city s core  but i wanted to know if you can rend anything inside the city  or even a bit further away  not too much though  ps  unless there s something special about it  universal studios is kind of out for me ,1

shimanami kaido  midway hostel rendations  and a couple bus questions ,i recently learned about the shimanami kaido and would love to do it  i unfortunately learned too late to do it over this long weekend  everything i could find was booked  even the bikes  so i m planning forward for a future weekend i m not a big biker at all so my idea is to do the trip over two days   that way i can take my time and really enjoy the views  that means though that i ll need to find a place to stay on the way  ideally it d be great if i could just find a place on the fly depending on how far i go  but with my luck everything would be booked  so i need to try to find some place near the midway point  anyone have any rendations   i d prefer cheap but if a place was really fantastic i d be open to hear about it also  to  hopefully  ease my mind could anyone tell me how hard it would be  if i got too tired or it got too late  to catch a bus on the intervening islands back to onomichi  from what i ve been able to find  the last bus  from imabari  looks to be around 7 30 pm thanks ,1

 serious question  certain tattoos and japan,i will start this post saying i know that most baths hot springs do not allow tattoos  but here we go  i also didn t want to put all my personal stuff in the title onto the post i  34f  love traveling to japan  like  a lot  i go every couple years and it s always a good time and i always go to onsens to relax  i never really thought about the tattoo ban because i have none  however  i am having a double mastectomy soon and was wondering if 3d nipple tattoos would be banned  i m already scared enough at the prospect of going to them with scarring since even if i get a reconstruction i know there will be marks  but the thought of not being able to go into onsen makes me feel so sad also  has anyone gone to japan after having a double mastectomy thank you for reading   edit  thank you so much for the answers everyone  i m so happy that i posted here  this put me at ease because now i know at the end of the tunnel there s a trip to a hot spring waiting for me ,1
three weeks in hokkaido for winter,i know it s super early to be making plans but i was hoping to go to hokkaido in january 2022 with friends  for a segment of the trip  was thinking around 2 weeks  we were going to drive around to shiretoko and then back taking stops along the way at other national parks and sites  in particular one of my friends studies ecology so i was hoping to be able to see the various wildlife such as cranes and eagles  however said friend also needs to return to ta courses so he can t be here for february  has anybody had experience with the wilderness of hokkaido in january toent if it s still great even if it s not peak season  also if this is a good idea  it s kind of hard for me to find information on such a trip in general especially for the winter  the two drivers have experience driving in the snow  chicago  for what it s worth ,1

itinerary check  end of march to start of april 2021   osaka,hello  i would like to ask for your opinion on my itinerary for spring 2021  i ve been to japan three times  tokyo  nagoya  fukuoka  and it ll be my first time in osaka  this time  i ll be travelling with my family  my parents are both over 50 and they find it difficult to walk for long lengths at a time  given that they ve gotten so used to bringing their cars everywhere  no joke  they d use it to drive to a neighbor s house that s basically a 5 minute walk away  although they re willing to lug it out during our annual overseas family trips  especially in areas where cabs and uber are expensive and we have to rely on public transportation  i want to make sure they re asfortable as possible  this means that as much as the itinerary allows  i try to give them breaks and pauses in between walks  meanwhile  my siblings have a penchant for wanting to take it slow during trips  unless it s for the non negotiable theme park visit and the rare group tours  they re rarely willing to wake up earlier than 9 am  this means that we usually get out and moving to tour around at around 10 or 11 am now  we decided to make namba our base because first  my parents don t enjoy making transfers to and from the airport  actually  they would much prefer shorteno transferutes going anywhere  this is also why we opted to stay in osaka  its public transportation is just more convenient than kyoto  given that there is a direct line between namba and kix  it seems like a good choice  second  we all enjoy shopping   especially at night  for some strange reason  this means that having dotonbori  shinsaibashi  and multiple malls within reach will be enjoyable for us tldr  we don t mind the hustle and bustle of the city but we also enjoy slow trips with that  here s the itinerary day 0  arrive in osaka  we land around 8 pm so i m expecting to be in the city around 10 pm  given that we re staying around namba  we ll probably explore the surrounding areas that are still alive at night  like dotonbori day 1  10 am   breakfast at kuromon market11 am   osaka museum of history1 pm   lunch2 pm   osaka castle  ride the gozabune  6 pm   wait for sakura illumination7 pm   shinsaibashi dotonboriday 2 whole day  universal studios japan  non negotiable  day 3 10 am   travel to nara note  we re just going to see the deers and walk around to see the temples a bit  we don t plan on staying too long  my family isn t too interested in seeing temples here  given that we have a key temples kyoto tour in theing days  also  if made to choose  we d all rather go to palaces and museums than visit temples 11 am   arrive in nara1 pm   return to osaka below is with amazing pass  2 pm   museum of housing and living3 30 pm   tenjinbashisuji5 pm   umeda sky6 pm   koji tenku art museum7 pm   dinner in malls around umeda station  pokemon center osakaday 4 8 am to 6 pm   kyoto temples group tour arashiyama  fushimi inari taisha  kiyomizu dera  kinkaku ji  rest in hotel7 pm   denden townday 5 10 30 am   leave hotel  a little later topensate for the early day before 11 30 am   arrive in kobe12 pm   have lunch at kobe beef restaurant1 30 pm   kitano ijinkan  as sherlock fans  we want to see the english house 3 pm   nunobiki herb garden  my dad has a green thumb so i put this in our itinerary with him in mind 5 pm   return to osaka6 pm   shinsekaiday 6 10 am   cup noodles museum  we want to try the noodles making class  which is 90 minutes long  also  my siblings love cup noodles  it s their penchant  unhealthy midnight snack 1 pm   return to namba  free shopping time in surrounding malls9 pm   flight outmany thanks in advance  also  if you have tips on directutes  that would be great  especially going to the cup noodles museum  since that would take 2 transfers by train  additional note  my siblings and i went for a spring trip to nagoya last year  and i observed that because of the weather  they re not the mostfortable facing the cold at night  wee from a city where it s summer all year round  in fact  during our trip last year  we would be back in our hotel by 8 9 pm and would only go out for convenience store runs  i also took that into consideration when i made this itinerary  also  before anyone asks  yes  we have taken the pandemic in consideration  we have high hopes but will be fine even if entry is still not allowed by then  we ll just rebook to autumn or winter 2021 if that s the case  given that all our flights and hotels are rebookable  it just gives us joy having something to look forward to so please don t rain on my parade byenting something along the lines of  you probably won t be able to go anyway because of coronavirus  i know that already   ,1

kanto 10 ish day itinerary  would love to hear thoughts and opinions,the trip is not scheduled  i m still planning   this will likely be next year or the year after thanks to the pandemic  but i plan on going once it is reasonably safe to do so and japan allows for tourism from the united states  goalsthis is a little bit of a nostalgia trip because i used to live in fussa  so you ll see that i have a bit of time scheduled to stay in tachikawa   i am hoping to make this trip in the fall when we go  so the colors on the mountains will likely be beautiful and the temperature should be nice my wife  who i met and married later in life  has never been to japan but loves anime  gardens  museums  and food we have an official rule that if i take her to a country with castles  she must see one   hence odawara being on this list    i know there are castles elsewhere in the country that are higher on people s lists    should i be looking at a day trip to one elsewhere i could potentially make the trip up to 14 days  with a definite day trip to kamakura    anything else i should strongly consider adding to the list  we could honestly just pick a station on the yamanote line and wander for the 2 extra days and be quite happy  hotels and foodwe are planning on utilizing business hotels except for splurging on a traditional inn in hakone   i may also splurge on a nicer room in tachikawa because the tachikawa grand always looked so cool   has anyone ever stayed there for food we re planning on convenience stores and quick meals for breakfast and lunch  and finding sit down restaurants in the evenings  runningi plan on running several days when i wake up while i m in japan   most likely laps around yoyogi park while i am staying in shinjuku  but possibly around the imperial palace   while in tachikawa i would likely run along the tama river or pay to run in showa kinen park   i am very open to suggestions because i mostly ran on my air force base  and not because i wanted to  itinerary  day 1  tokyo  arrive in tokyo  get to hotel in shinjuku for 3 nights  better place for hotel  deal with the jet lag and get settled  day 2  tokyo   ueno   tokyo national museum  shopping in ameya yokocho   akihabara   lunch  shopping  gawking   shinjuku   dinner and drinks in yokocho omoide  wandering  day 3  tokyo   harajuku   meiji jingu and yoyogi park  lunch   shinigawa   sengakuji temple and museum  shibuya   dinner and wandering  shopping  day 4  tachikawa   check out of shinjuku hotel and take the ome line to my old stomping grounds  hotel in tachikawa  showa memorial gardens  shop  drinks at county clare irish pub  an old haunt  day 5  fussa  walk around my old neighborhood  coco ichibanya for lunch  walk down what we affectionately called bar row to see if any of the old bars are still named the same  shop a little bit  if we are still there by dinner time  find one of my old favorite restaurants  if they still exist  day 6   mt  takao  climb mountain by less used path  specifically the biwa waterfall trail  and see shrine bying down the paved path  grab some tororo soba for lunch   could i fit in something else here   perhaps visiting ome or hachioji for wandering and eating  day 7   mt  mitake  moves based on sake tour availability  mitake station   gyokudo art museum  walk to sawai station via gorge path  sawai station   sake brewery english tour 1130 twice a week  get some lunch if needed  back to mitake station via train  cable car or hike to top station on mount mitake  hike to musashi mitake shrine  head back to shinjuku for one more night  dinner  day 8  tokyo  odawara  shinjuku   gyoen national garden  train to odawara  odawara   odawara castle and gardens  travel to hakone  stay in ryokan  day 9  hakone   ropeway  pirate cruise  hakone checkpoint  hakone shrine  open air museum   i am really open to advice because hakone seems like it has an abundance of choices   my wife would really like to see mt  fuji so that is her only requirement  get back to tokyo  day 10  fly home  fit something in if there is time      tokyo edo museum  fly back to us  possible additional day between odawara and hakone   kamakura   temples  shrines  and the beach,1
airbnb joining the go to travel campaign,i have been eagerly anticipating this and glad to see an albeit vague announcement from airbnb i contacted airbnb japan for details but i m not expecting too much too soon   anyone hear anything else    unlike the hotels  i am expecting to have to spend way too long translating and filling various forms in the application refund process to take advantage  but whatever ,1

packed  late autumn  tokyo   tohoku solo trip rendations,hi all   with quarantine  i ve been planning a solo trip to japan for fun   i m aiming for about a two week trip with about 5 6 days around tokyo and the rest elsewhere  although i don t know where to go from there day 1  early morning arrival at haneda  down to fujisawa enoshima  and then back up to yokohama to meet up with a friend  with whom i ll be stayingday 2  morning in yokohama  then a train up to marunouchi spending the rest of the day with both the imperial palace and ginza  wrapping up at a hostelday 3  early morning at tsukiji  then slowly making my way north through akihabara and ueno  finishing up at asakusa and staying at a 9 hours capsule hotelday 4  another early start  heading to okutama station via shinjuku  hiking mt  nokogiri  odake  and mitake  finallying back to unwind at a sento in shinjuku and staying at a business hotelday 5  a more relaxed day spent around western tokyo  from shinjuku to shibuya and enjoying the parks and shopping in between  finishing up at 9 hours shinjukuare there any other tokyo neighborhoods that i should include  and does the above week sound too strenuous  beyond the first five days  i plan not on heading west to kyoto hiroshima but instead north into tohoku for a bit of a nature fix   it s a bit unusual but i m into bleak  cloudy climates  watching youtube videos of cape soya with its gray waves and rolling fields really resonated with me   any rendations would be wee ,1
my 3 weeks in japan in the fall,hi i went to japan in the fall 2 years ago and with fall approaching  albeit underpletely different circumstances i thought it might be useful for those planning their trips in the future i went to japan with 5 of my friends  4 spent 2 weeks there and i spent an additional week with another friend  we paid about  900 round trip from iad airport to narita airport the first day we arrived at the airport and took the train to our airbnb in the middle of tokyo  on the way we passed by some tight streets with a bunch of izakayas and restaurants  we decided to have our first dinner in one of them day 2  halloween   disney world sea  we had been trying to figure out when the best time to go to disney  after this day it would be christmas themed  on this day it would have the halloween decorations and from our experience they were pretty limited  however  the special thing about halloween is that it is one of the few days where guests are allowed to dress up as disney characters in the park  the experience felt like a giant convention  but despite this special day it was not unreasonably busy and by taking advantage of fast pass we didn t have to wait much for anything  be warned that they were on the paper fast pass when we visited in 2018 day 3   meiji shrine festival  one of the best things that you can do on a vacation is find some special event and be a part of it  to me the interesting part of the temple this took place at  is that although you are in the middle of the city it feels like a nature sanctuary  the actual festival activities were pretty sparse and it looked like probably a good deal of the activities and food wouldn t start till later   travel to kyoto  traveling to kyoto was an experience in itself  we took the shinkansen which most people tell every tourist to buy the jr rail pass  most of the people in my group did so but when i planned my trip i found since i was taking the bus and other forms of travel that weren t covered that i wasn t actually going to be saving any money   adachi  honestly i don t remember much about this place  i remember one of the first nights in kyoto we tried to randomly go into several restaurants and got denied in a way that we think was prejudice  basically as we entered a few establishments they began to greet us but once they saw my pakistani friend they began to suggest the place was full  we tested this a few times and even one time he called a restaurant in japanese  he asked if they were full or he needed a reservation  they told him no  that we could just walk in  so immediately we walked to the restaurant and as soon as they saw him they immediately told us that they were full when it was very obvious they weren t   day 4   nijo castle  the location for this place is superb  you really don t need to go out of your way to get to it and it s one of the best temples in kyoto  many of them you don t see exquisite interiors so this place has both good indoor and outdoor scenery  for this place they have guided tours or audio tours  i usually never do audio tours but i was pleasantly surprised how it added to the experience  we did go out of order a few times which confused us while listening to the audio   bike throughout kyoto  with metro and public transportation not the best in kyoto and bike infrastructure being prevalent it soon became my preferred form of travel  biking through a city also provides an excellent way to experience it  you can take time to stop at anything that piques your interest  my rendation would be to find a bike shop close to your hotel and airbnb  rent it for several days so you don t have to return it every afternoon and don t think about getting around any other way   kinkaku ji temple you basically get to see a golden temple from a distance  your route is pretty strict and there isn t much to do here  it is a nice view but you aren t going to get that much out of it  if you are already close by it might be worth going  or if you have really nothing else to do but kill time it s fine to do   menbaka fire ramen  you go to this place for the entertainment value with all the fire and hot oil  the food is fine  but not really the purpose  get drinks and have some fun with friends day 5   kiyomizu dera  i rode my bike to this temple through some narrow roads weaving between the pedestrians while tailing the cars and motorbikes  when i got to the top there was no officially dedicated bike parking  i therefore took a risk attaching it to a random piece of metal hoping that i wouldn t get a ticket or boot  i then continued forward to the top of the temple area which held a tall red spire  there wasn t any obvious thing to look and see at the top but a person was offering entrance into this dark tunnel for a few yen  i was intrigued  paid and went below  what i found was an oddly spiritual experience of a dark tunnel where you could not see anything before you  there were people around that you could and sometimes bump into  we all walked in a line  feeling the walls as our guides  slowly we moved till we found the only source of light to be a small beaming from the roof and lighting a large stone in the center  the path moved me close to the stone and i  like many others before me  touched the stone  which illuminated my fingers  from this  there wasn t much to do besides the most fun racing down the hill  chasing cars and weaving through pedestrians   vietnamese komugon kyoto  in the dc area most vietnamese are either pho or banh mi  i believe the cooking style was more south vietnamese and had flavors that i hadn t experienced before  the soups felt more curry based  similar to some thai soups  this was one of the better places i went to on a whim day 6   fushimi inari taisha  these are the famous endless red gates that you hike through  the scale and sheer number is impressive  the hike itself wasn t terribly difficult  with options along the way to purchase refreshments or souvenirs  after reaching the top you can relax and enjoy the view  the way back down intersects the way up so you usually don t gain much on the descent but it s significantly faster so not a big deal  a friend and i found an alternative descent which looked like an unmarked path down the side of the mountain which we would later find was a fire route  what we found was a fantastic view of a mountain of giant beautiful fallen trees  some of the best shots were taken there and was an incredible experience not knowing where the trail led or how we would get back home   travel to osaka  we had a choice to stay in osaka orute from kyoto every time  we initially didn t have too much planned in osaka so we chose toute with it not being too long   ichiran  this is a very popular ramen shop with an extended line out of the building  you get placed in individually isolated seats  i managed to sit next to one friend  while the rest of the group got split up  the overall experience is a little unique since they deliver the ramen directly to you from the kitchen  however  the ramen quality didn t blow me away and didn t necessarily feel worth the long wait  i for sure had far better ramen experiences in japan with less waiting and equivalent pricing   dontonbori  a landmark high rise shopping building with themed floors for various items  when you are in there you basically feel like you can find anything there day 7   round one stadium arcade  a fun multi level arcade that you can easily kill some hours with your friends  they have a bunch of interesting cutesy   weird photo booths that you can capture the experience with your friends   hozenji sampei  kind of a late night drunk food place  i think you ought to get a bit drunk to enjoy it though day 8   kurama hot spring  this seemed like an isolated mountain retreat in a beautiful hot spring  it did take some time to get away but felt underwhelming in the bath and view aspect   travel to takayama  for this i took a bus from kyoto to takayama which was a several hour ride with 1 stop in the middle   takayama  this is a beautiful little mountain town that you can traverse pretty quickly by foot  you can view nice streams and trees with a few picture ess moments day 9   7 eleven  this place and family mart became the de facto morning breakfast place  i couldn t tell you how many egg salad and pork cutlet sandwiches i have had   konji ryokan  there are a bunch of ryokan s at the bottom of the mountain  this particular one i was basically the only guest  there was an indoor tiled bath  outside was an outdoor natural spring  i actually enjoyed this far more than the kurama hot spring  i did spend from 2pm to the end of the day in this town relaxing  i thought i would be very tired from the bus ride but what i actually found is that i had too much energy and really wanted to do something  i didn t end up doing anything besides try to orient myself in the tiny village and find food  since i can t read japanese and google maps did not show proper restaurant locations i found myself accidentally entering someone s home on occasion before following a group of people into a building and hoping that it was a restaurant  i did try tounicate to a shop clerk and ask here where there was a restaurant but i think she thought i was asking her if her store was a restaurant  she then responded by giving me the standard japanese x which means no day 10   shinhotaka ropeway  this is a gondola of sorts that provides great views of the japanese alps     hike the japanese alps  the gondola takes you to a giant visitor center with a gift shop  from here you have a bunch of trails and routes to go  if you start walking  there is a hiker registration area where you basically list where you are going  how many are in your group  and how long you intend to be gone  the purpose is to make sure that if something happens they can make sure all the people are accounted for  near this place  a japanese grandmother saw me as a lone and clueless foreigner who might get lost without direction  i think her impression was not far off from reality and therefore she assigned some random college kids to guide me  i joined them on the initial hike which brought us to a hut at the top of the mountain  one of which i had been trying to book leading up to the trip but they didn t have online registration and my phone calls were not going through  these guys helped me book a stay at the hut and we went on our way  i decided to do so because it had been said that sundown was around 4pm and if i was to take the rope way everyday  i would probably not be able to reach the more remote areas and there is a cutoff time for rope way and i didn t want to be stranded at the top of the mountain  the main hike i did  which was me booking it most of the way waspletely down the mountain to taisho pond and back up to the nishiho hut   nishiho hut  a bit expensive but very convenient if you want to continue hiking and relax at the top of the mountain  when i was there it was not particularly busy  there are only a few rooms and so normally you sleep in the group on a japanese futon around other people  i was alone in my room and could move around alone very easily  food was included in the stay and it was filling  hearty and brought much needed sustenance after a night of hiking  the only real problem i had with the place was the absolute lack of running water available to the guests  i d understand if it was rationed but after using the bathroom you couldn t wash your hands  after the meal there was no water to freely drink and washing up was no option  by the end of the day of hiking and sweating i really wanted to wash my face  the way i did manage was by buying the overpriced bottled water from the vending machine and using it to drink and wash my face day 11  without having taken a proper shower and feeling properly icky i decided to head back down to konji ryokan after breakfast to relax and freshen up day 12   bus to nagoya  the plan to go to nagoya was an afterthought  i had assumed since it was the 3rd largest city in japan that it must have quite a bit going on  i think it can easily be avoided to avoid ill feelings to yourself  i can t actually think of anything particular that we did besides trying to go to some random clubs that were underwhelming and spending time roaming random city parks at night  at this point in the trip it felt great to finally meet up with another trip mate and we spent the time catching up on our separate adventures  instead of going to the mountains with me  he spent his time going to hiroshima and fukuoka meeting with japanese locals  doing airbnb experiences and partying with random japanese guys  while i was relaxing in the mountains he told me about the crazy clubs in osaka he went to and all the fun things he did   hostel wasabi  this was my first hostel experience and whenparing the price to my friend  it wasn t substantially cheaper than his airbnb aodations which he had privacy and ac  this hostel you basically have to walk on tiptoes  you are constantly surrounded by people and the lack of ac makes the nights a bit more difficult to sleep day 13   noritake garden  this is a quaint small garden and fountains  surrounded by beautiful trees and a backdrop of a brick style industrial building day 14   akihabara  i didn t originally plan to go to akihabara but i found that it was just fun hanging out with a buddy and chill here  go into random stores and see all the anime stuff on sale  go into random arcades and just waste tons of time day 15   maach ecute  such an interesting shopping area made from an old train station  the shops themselves were fairly interested  we spent a good deal of time listening to music from a very upscale audiopany   hitachino brewing lab  located in maach ecute with a great view of the area and a wonderful place to relax  the beer sampler was so good  every beer tasted so good day 16  basically spent the day going to random record stores and spent the day in shibuyaday 17   sushi ya  probably the best restaurant i went to in japan and probably the best sushi restaurant i ve ever been to  we managed to get into this restaurant last minute  the other restaurants like sushi sauto and sushi kanesaka often require months of reservations or can only be made by going through specific channels such as by booking it directly through an expensive hotel day 18   hey taito  we were leaving japan this day so we chose the last activity to do was to hit this arcade in akihabara again there are a few things that i want to share that are not captured in the itinerary  thrift stores in japan are next level and i d rend spending a good bit of time searching and snagging deals on very unique pieces  between day 11 and 12 i found myself in shirakawago as a stop on my way to nagoya and spent the day going through the unesco world heritage site  there isn t exactly much to do besides walk through the town  relax and climb to the top of a mountain and see the town from a view  i d rend it as a several hour event if it s on your way if you want to see a map based view of the trip with an hourly breakdown  check out my itinerary here ,1
philosopher s path  walk or bike,i know the philosopher s path can actually be a decent walk  which is fine  buting from gion nishiki market  i was thinking about riding a bike up there my only concerns are 1  crowds along the path  i will be there during sakura 2  there are parts i d prefer to walk and enjoy  and not bike through or past  even walking the bike  i think there are sections that i couldn t fully do unless i left the bike somewhere i was thinking maybe biking to nyakuoji bridge  and then walking up and back  looks like it s 1 mile from the bridge to ginkakuji  so it would be 2 miles to walk there and back  not bad at all does this sound like something that splits the different between saving time with bikes but enjoy the slow walk of the path thanks in advance edit  time of year added for context,1
sept 2019 trip report with food rendations  2 weeks in tokyo  akita  kakunodate  hirosaki  sapporo  noboribetsu  hakodate,as i m currently planning our next trip to japan for 2021 and loving everyone s rendations  i thought i d post a report from our 2019 trip in case it is helpful for others  i know we can t travel right now but planning for a far off future is helping me get my fix  i ve included our food and hotels and advice on attractions  this was our second trip to japan  having previously visited the big attractions in tokyo  osaka and kyoto in 2015  we re a couple in our late 20s from london and focused this trip on visiting smaller towns and cities  lots of walking and lots of food transport  we knew we wanted to visit hokkaido and after we discovered the  jr east south hokkaido  rail pass we pretty much planned our trip around this  i highly rend this pass as it was so cost effective and flexible  as you get 6 days travel within a 14 day period  we could use it throughout our 2 week trip and didn t feel the need to travel every day so we wouldn t  waste  a day as we would with the 7 day pass   timing and weather  we originally planned to go in october but pushed it back to early september to avoid the rugby world cup  we re not rugby fans and didn t want it to impact prices  we d been warned about the heat but as most of our trip would be further north we thought we d be okay  it was very hot in tokyo   i found it similar to other humid cities such as bangkok or singapore so it was manageable if you knew what to expect  drank lots of water and made air conditioned stop offs  london can reach 36  in summer but has essentially zero air conditioning  so we love cities that are actually set up to deal with heat  the only days that the heat was almost unmanageable was disneyland and disneysea  where we were out in the sun from 8am to 10pm and running all over the place  if you plan to visit disney during summer or early autumn i highly rend staying in an onsite hotel so you can take a midday break and refresh  a typhoon also passed through tokyo on our first day and we saw some transport disruption the weather in t hoku and hokkaido was absolutely perfect and i would definitely rend going in september  sunny and warm days of around 24  and cooler evenings aodation  we stayed mainly in business hotels and a few ryokans  i always picked the hotel closest to the station as we were travelling so much  but transport was so efficient and stress free i should have looked more at attractions we wanted to hit instead  i always went for the cheapest smallest room as i knew we wouldn t spend much time there  hotel rooms are small in lots of european cities as well so i think this is less of a concern for uspared to americans  there were a few places where i maybe should have gone for the room category up so we could actually move around   day 1   tokyo  we left london at 3pm and landed at 10 30am the next day at tokyo narita  i got hardly any sleep on the plane  but i ve always been hit badly by jetlag going to asia so i was prepared for this and didn t plan much for the first day  we ordered sim cards from  sakura mobile  and collected them from a counter in terminal 2 arrivals  this took longer than expected and it was past midday by the time we were leaving the airport  our hotel room wasn t ready so we dropped our bags and went to lunch beforeing back to check in  we were very tired by this point and chilled in the room for a few hours then headed out in the evening to visit senso ji temple  it s nice and serene in the evening with hardly anyone there and we took some cool night time pictures  we also visited the don quijote in asakusa to pick up snacks and kitkats  that night a typhoon passed over tokyo and there was lots of loud rain and wind   luckily we were so exhausted that we slept right through it food  lunch at  rokurinsha  in tokyo station for dipping ramen  queue was around 30 minutes but we were so excited for our first meal of the trip we didn t mind the waiting and people watching  rended for the thick and chewy noodles and huge portions  i preferred the dipping ramen at  fuunji  though  dinner ended up being 7 eleven food and kitkats as we were so tired     aodation   karaksa hotel  for 4 nights as we wanted to be convenient for tokyo station  the price was great  only ¥39 200 for 4 nights  but our room was so  so tiny that we basically couldn t both stand up at the same time  i d rend it for location and clean and minimalist design if you get a room above a  hollywood twin travel  airport limousine to tokyo station as it dropped off right outside our hotel and we were tired  we had pasmo cards that we actually remembered to save from our previous trip for other travel around tokyo   day 2   tokyo i was short on holiday days for this trip  so spent the first day in mypany s tokyo office  the only thing of interest was that the overnight typhoon had caused transport issues  i caught the marunouchi line from tokyo station and it was running fine but surprisingly empty  it turns out loads of other lines were down until 10am  so lots of people were very late to work  something to keep in mind if you are travelling during typhoon season and need to get somewhere urgently  we headed to shibuya for the evening as we wanted somewhere buzzing to walk around and grab dinner  we also bought tickets to disneysea and disneyland for the next 2 days at the disney store in shibuya food    on yasai  for hot pot on the rendation of a japanese friend  all you can eat hotpot and soft drinks was around  25 and it s ideal for english speakers as you order extra food and drinks through the i pads on the table day 3 and 4   tokyo   disneysea and disneyland i m a big disney parks fan and pretty much converted my partner when we visited disneysea on our last japan trip  despite him not liking disney or theme parks  so this time we visited both disneysea and disneyland  my advice is to definitely go even if you don t like disney  as the japanese guests are just as much a unique and charming part of the experience  just make sure you research the attractions you want to do and get there at least an hour before park opening  unfortunately  jetlag had caught up with us and i failed to follow my own advice and we arrived 10 minutes after opening on our disneysea day to massive crowds  which set our whole day back  it was super busy partly because the typhoon the day before meant everyone had deferred by a day and partly because it was the beginning of the halloween season so you could wear costumes  keep both of those factors in mind if you visit during september  disneyland the next day wasn t nearly as busy and we got there an hour before opening and had a good head start on all the rides  the japanese guests  halloween costumes were amazing and it s worth going in september or october just to see this  we loved seeing a big group of princesses all eating curry rice at lunch food  we snacked non stop through the day as snacks were all adorably halloween themed  we also somehow ended up eating curry both days at  casbah food court  and  hungry bear restaurant  which were reasonably priced for theme park food and fixed our curry craving  casbah is supposed to be  indian style  curry but it defintely just tasted like japanese curry served with naan travel  train direct from tokyo station to maihama and then the monorail to disney  even though we were staying in the most convenient location to get there from central tokyo i would stay on site if going during the summer due to needing a break from the heat during the day   day 5   tokyo   sumo  when we knew we d be in tokyo during the sumo it became a mission to get tickets  we bought them online when they were released  which was around 2am uk time  and they go very quickly  i originally tried to get tickets for tuesday but they sold out by the time i got through to the page so i grabbed thursday instead   this site has a good guide to buying them  we got seats in the b area we arrived at ryogoku at around 11am and stayed until 4 30pm  we would have stayed later if we weren t catching the shinkansen to akita that evening  it was so interesting watching the different levels of sumos as the day went on  absolutely a highlight of our trip we arrived late into akita and were immediately faced with a huge blow up akita dog and multiple namahage demon statues at the station  during this trip we really looked forward to seeing what the display in a regional station would be food  lunch at the restaurant in the sumo arena so we could try sumo food  chanko hot pot  meals were all between ¥1000   ¥1800  dinner was our first train bento of the trip  we ate a lot these and always tried to get the local special   aodation   dormy inn akita  for 2 nights  reasonably priced  near the station and with a really nice onsen   travel  activated our jr rail pass today to travel to akita  we reserved seats on the day with no issue day 6   akita and kakunodate weather was beautifully sunny and not at all humid so spent the morning walking around senshu park and visiting the shrines  chatted to a few locals who seemed surprised to see foreigners and asked where we were from  there were also several groups of adorable school children in matching hats taking lessons in the park  akita itself was quiet and there weren t many attractions  but we liked slowing down and experiencing a regional town  headed to kakunodate around midday and enjoyed walking around the town and visiting the samurai houses and shops  it was serenely empty and we only saw a few other tourists so the atmosphere was wonderful  i m sure it s most beautiful in spring but it was lovely and green in summer   food  tried the kakunodate local cold udon at  this restaurant  for lunch  we found the area near akita station limited for dinner but luckily the seibu department store has basement restaurants so we ended up at a reasonably priced  tonkatsu place    travel  used another day on our rail pass to get to kakunodate and back  train was very empty so no seat reservations needed   day 7   hirosaki left akita early to travel to hirosaki  i added a stop here to break up the trip to sapporo and it was such a good decision  aomori is so obsessed with apples and we found it so weirdly charming  we passed the massive apple statue at the station and walked to our ryokan to drop off our bags and head to hirosaki castle park  we explored the park and saw the castle  stopping off for some apple pie and kakigori  then walked to tsugaru han neputa village and saw all the floats and lanterns for the neputa festival  there was a tour guide who spoke some english and the rooms filled with floats were spectacular   made me want to attend the festival  the museum desk then called us a taxi to take us to hirosaki apple park to go apple picking  loved this place   so many different apple varieties and hundreds of apple themed souvenirs  stayed so long we missed the last bus back and weren t sure how to call a taxi with limited japanese so ended up walking back to town  which wasn t so bad as we got a really nice look at the residential area food  dinner at this  izakaya  no english menu or english spoken by the staff  so we went for the ¥1800 daily special and ended up with a beautiful selection of seafood  the chef was very interested in where we were from so definitely a time where we wish we spoke more japanese   aodation   ishiba ryokan  for 1 night  very old and atmospheric ryokan with the most charming owner  he spoke brilliant english and even insisted on driving us round town to rend a restaurant for dinner travel  used another day on our rail pass to get from akita to hirosaki day 8   sapporo our biggest day of travel so far  but it was nice to relax on a train all morning and eat bento boxes  arrived early afternoon in sapporo and explored for a bit before heading to odori park and spending the rest of the day at sapporo autumn festival  we were thrilled to find out we were visiting during a food festival and had a great time exploring the stalls and trying food from different regions in hokkaido  weather was a little cooler but still nice and warm into the evening aodation   jr east hotel mets sapporo  for 3 nights  our favourite business hotel with great bathrooms right near the station   travel  used another day on our jr pass  this was our mostplicated day as we went from hirosaki to shin aomori to shin hakodate to sapporo and spent around 6 hours on trains day 9   sapporo  we originally planned to take a day trip to otaru today  but multiple days of lots of walking were catching up to us so we took a chill day instead  we mainly wandered around downtown sapporo  ate delicious food and did some shopping food   a happy pancake  to try japanese souffle pancakes  so fluffy and so sweet   sapporo ramen republic  for dinner  a whole floor of ramen restaurants  we chose the one with unlimited eggs   day 10   sapporo spent the morning at sapporo beer museum  although we did the free version without the tour and just headed to the beer hall after  found the history of sapporo far more interesting than the beer  explored the area nearby and then took the subway to ishiya chocolate factory  we thought this place was a bit overpriced  the  tour  you pay for is basically a walk through that overlooks the factory  and veryercial touristy  but still had a great time because the whole thing was fake british themed and so it was incredibly entertaining to be british people there  there were phone boxes and a double decker bus and tudor houses and gardens all done in a slightly japanese way so it all felt a bit surreal  we also had a japanese couple stop us to chat and they were delighted when we told them we were english and wanted to shake our hands   food   sapporo beer garden  for beer and all you eat  jingisukan  that we grilled ourselves  i m sure this was quite a touristy place to try it but it was definitely delicious   fugetsu  in sapporo station in the evening as we were craving okinomiyaki  it was cheap and a great option if you ve never tried cook it yourself as they had instruction videos at all the tables   day 11   sapporo and noboribetsu spent the morning walking around hokkaido university campus and visiting hokkaido university museum  it was free and interesting but there are very limited english exhibits  after lunch we headed to the station to get a bus to noboribetsu  we were booked at ryokan so spent the rest of the day soaking in the onsen and eating food   nemuro hanamaru  for a conveyor belt sushi lunch  we queued for about 40 minutes  very tasty and well priced sushi and they had some great sapporo specialities  we also picked up cheese tarts from  kinotoya bake  before we left  dinner was kaiseki at the ryokan and was just as beautiful and seasonal as expected   aodation   dai ichi takimotokan  ryokan for 1 night  we d only stayed at small ryokans before so this place was a bit of a surprise  lots of different types of onsens that all had different features and hundreds of rooms  there were a few chinese tour groups that made it less than relaxing  it was a great one off experience but we definitely prefer the smaller places where you can meet the owner   travel  we were planning to use a day of our jr pass to get to noboribetsu but discovered there was a bus from sapporo station that dropped off at all the local hotels  this was much simpler with luggage and only cost ¥1100 each day 12   noboribetsu and hakodate we were up early for more time in the onsen and then set out to walk up hell valley and round oyunuma pond  the whole place smelled so much like sulphur and was spectacular with the steam rising  there were a lot of tourists and we also saw some school groups  but it thinned out as we moved further away from hell valley  we went back to collect our luggage then caught the bus to the station to continue on to hakodate  arriving early afternoon we relaxed a bit too much after checking in to our hotel and then realised we wanted to climb mount hakodate before it got dark  we were often taken aback by how early sunset is in summer in japan  we found the beginning of the route up with some help from an american guy who spoke good japanese and led us to the tourist information centre to pick up a map  the climb was rended to take over an hour but we raced up in 45 minutes to catch the sunset  the plan had been to take the ropeway back down  upon reaching the top though we found it had been suspended due to strong winds  massive queues were beginning to form for the buses down and we knew we d be waiting for ages  so we made the rash decision to hike back down in the almost dark  it maybe wasn t the smartest idea  we used our phone torches for light and walked cautiously fast   food  we became mildly obsessed with hakodate burger chain  lucky pierrot  and ended up eating there twice over 2 days and buying branded t shirts  it was definitely cheap fast food but uniquely japanese and very delicious aodation   apa hotel hakodate ekimae  for 2 nights  probably the cheapest hotel we stayed at and it did feel a bit run down  i also wouldn t rend staying near hakodate station as the area felt deserted in the evenings   travel  another day on our jr pass from noboribetsu to hakodate day 13   hakodate spent the morning exploring hakodate morning market and having a seafood breakfast  exploring kanemori red brick warehouse and motomachi park area  hakodate feels a bit like a bizarro european town due to all the european style buildings and the trams  in the afternoon we took the tram over to gory kaku and stayed until sunset  the whole place was beautiful at golden hour but we found ourselves quite cold after dark so had to retreat to the closest ramen restaurant   food  we had a super fresh ¥500 seafood bowl breakfast from a place in  hakodate market  and snacked on a few other local specialities from stalls  there was lots of themed autumn food in september so i tried far too many pumpkin  sweet potato and chestnut snacks  we also bought some overpriced hokkaido melon simply because our curiosity overcame us  i thought it was too sweet  we tried the famous sweet omelette cakes at  pastry snaffle s  and were drawn into  lucky pierrot  again after we found out that each branch has a different menu   day 14   hakodate and tokyo we left early for another long day of travel fuelled by train bentos  the rugby world cup had started the previous day and we arrived back in tokyo to find many more western tourists than a week ago  we were staying in shinjuku so went for a walk around the area and visited meiji shrine  as it was a saturday harajuku looked ufortably busy  we had tickets to the robot restaurant that evening  something we d avoided during our first trip to tokyo but now thought we might as well experience once  the whole audience seemed to be scottish and irish rugby fans  so although it was the most touristy experience of the trip the energy was great and we had a lot of fun food  wanted to try monjayaki so ended up in a  department store restaurant  in shinjuku for more cook it yourself okinomiyaki and monjayaki   aodation   hotel century southern tower  for 2 nights  our priciest hotel of the trip and definitely worth it for location and view travel  used the final day of our jr pass to go hakodate to shin hakodate to tokyo  this was the first time we weren t able to get seats together when making the reservation on the day of travel  so be aware of that if travelling on the tohoku hokkaido shinkansen on a saturday day 15   tokyo did some final shopping in shinjuku in the morning and stopped by our favourite coffee place  blue bottle  visited  nezu museum  in the afternoon and spent ages exploring the garden  bring bug spray if you go in summer though as i was bitten like crazy  the cafe at nezu had a long wait so we ended up walking to nearby  sakurai  and having a tea tasting instead  it was expensive but a lovely serene experience for the final day  spent the evening exploring department stores and buyings as many packaged snacks as our suitcases would allow food    katsukura  for tonkatsu  highly rend this place for tonkatsu near shinjuku station  it put the tonkatsu we d eaten earlier in the trip to shame   ebisoba ichigen  for the most delicious shrimp ramen  our friend had rended this place for sapporo and i m so glad we managed to squeeze it in   day 16   tokyo back to london ,1

honeymoon itinerary ideas for september 2021  fuji  kanazawa  kiso valley  osaka  okayama  hiroshima,we re planning our 3 week honeymoon to japan for the beginning of september 2021 and would love to get some tips and ideas from others  this will be our third time in japan  our first trip was november 2015 and covered tokyo  kyoto and osaka  our second trip was september 2019 and we pretty much based it around the south east hokkaido jr pass  we went tokyo  kakundodate  akita  hirosaki  sapporo  noboribetsu  hakodate  tokyo  as the third trip is our honeymoon  we re less focused on ticking items off and want to focus on splurging a bit  relaxing and enjoying ourselves whilst still seeing some new places  some notes  we re big foodies and all our travel has a big focus on food  we ll try just about anything and generally prefer interesting local cuisine and street food rather than high end dining  we also absolutely love those japanese towns with a specialty local cuisine or single famous food  we loved hirosaki because they were so obsessed with apples  we tend not to be fans of  bucket list  tourist attractions and prefer quirky and more niche stuff  but also appreciate that some attractions in japan just need to be visited in a particular way to avoid the tour buses  we found it hot but manageable in tokyo in september before  but admit we far preferred it in t hoku and hokkaido  we re staying south this time so are prepared for the weather  but appreciate tips for any places  that won t be super humid   edit  i should also probably mention that we re going in september because we want to go straight after the wedding  we ve weighed up the waiting a few months vs going straight away debate and decided we want to go straight away to continue the high and celebration of the wedding  we love japanese trains and based our whole last trip around lots of train travel and found it super manageable  even with luggage  for a 3 week trip we ll likely get a 14 day jr pass  but appreciate tips for other ways to manage transport draft itinerary day 1 leave london and fly overnight to tokyo haneda days 2   4 mount fuji many friends have advised me that the first few days of your honeymoon should be as relaxing as possible with very little planned  we ve never been to fuji before and want a luxury place within easy reach of tokyo where we can relax and not feel the need to do anything  i ve be a bit obsessed with hoshinoya fuji resort ever since i discovered it  as it ticks all the boxes of a great view  although fully aware that in september we may not see fuji  good privacy to relax  minimalist design  a few optional activities and outdoor space to explore  fully wee any other suggestions for the first few days though   aodation  3 nights hoshinoya fuji  or similar transport  i believe we can get the fujikyuko bus straight from haneda to fuji   days 5   8 kanazawa  japanese alps and kiso valley became interested in  kanazawa  after reading a few accounts of it being very charming  with traditional areas but also interesting cafes and shops  i also like the idea of a much less touristy kyoto  we thought kyoto was beautiful but found it very touristy and a bit too much like a checklist of attractions  i ve wanted to visit the  kiso valley  for a while as it sounds so serene  and we love soba   we d want to do the walk between  magone  and  tsumago  and stay in a ryokan  i ve also seen a few other towns in the japanese alps that seem beautiful and interesting so potentially adding one of those in aodation  2 nights in kanazawa business hotel  1 night alps town hotel ryokan  1 night fujioto ryokan tsumago  or similar transport  to get to kanazawa from fuji it looks like we ll have to head back to tokyo first and get the hokuriku shinkansen  getting to kiso valley will likely have to be via nagoya  ideally anywhere else we visit would fit in along the way days 9   11 osaka and surrounding towns we really liked  osaka  so want to base ourselves here for a few days and eat lots  looking to add in a day trip or two  we never visited  nara  before so not sure if that is worth doing  i ve also heard good things about  minoo   aodation  3 nights in a hotel likely near osaka station  stayed in dotonbori in the past and want somewhere a bit quieter this time transport  bus from kiso valley to nagiso to nagoya to osaka  day trips on jr lines from osaka days 12   14 okayama  hiroshima and surrounding towns we have friends in  okayama  so want to stop by there and visit a few surrounding places  is  naoshima  worth a day visit  we d also like to potentially visit another town nearby  maybe  takamatsu   hiroshima  is mainly on our list because we love okinomiyaki and want to try authentic hiroshima style  but we d also obviously like to visit the peace memorial museum and park  we re less interested in seeing  miyajima  as we re concerned it will just be lots of people getting a photo op aodation  1 2 nights in okayama with friends  depending on if we want to spend a night in another town  1 night hiroshima business hotel transport  osaka to okayama  okayama to hiroshima  potentially okayama to takamatsu days 15   16 disneysea we adore disneysea and a honeymoon is finally our chance to splurge and stay in the hotel miracosta  we d aim to arrive late afternoon and check in  spend the full day at disneysea the next day and then relax the next morning before heading to tokyo centre aodation  2 nights hotel miracosta transport  hiroshima to tokyo to maihama  days 17   19 tokyo we want to spend our last few days in  tokyo  eating great food  generally enjoying the atmosphere and visiting a few attractions  we ve stayed in shinjuku and tokyo station area before so would love a smaller neighbourhood this time aodation  3 nights somewhere nice  as it s our last few days  but not absolute blow the budget day 20 tokyo haneda back to london heathrow ,1

advice on backpacking across the country exclusively by bus and local trains,hi all i ve read the faq s but i haven t found an up to date answer nor previous real cases of someone doing what i am attempting  apologies for the long post  i ll try to split the main points for ease of reading a little bit of background on the way i travel  i ve seen half the world mainly by bicycle and on a low budget  18 000km in total  self supported  so i am used to slow travelling and skipping many touristic relevant places due to the implied logistics  besides a general direction to follow  i never do much planning and i ve missed countless interesting things  but that s fine with me since i enjoy the journey from a to b more than what i can get to see at those places  and i ll  always  have the opportunity to go back if i really want to now  i ve never been to japan  and every time the idea pops up in my head i only see myself doing it in the same way i ve always travelled  yet  japan is somewhat different to the other countries i ve been to before  it has a great hospitality industry  good transportation links and many unique experiences that i specifically don t want to miss on  onsens  food  temples  rituals  hikes  etc  therefore  i have to find apromise that allows me some freedom  and backpacking seems to be the answer to that  i ve previously backpacked in china  i speak the language and know my way around  and had a blast thanks to how easy it is to book anything on the spot  planes  trains  hotels  etc  and go wherever  whenever you feel you want to i understand that japan won t allow me that freedom and that i ll have to plan my route at least 2 3 days in advance  but my main concern is how feasible is to get between point a and b without using a jr pass and keeping a low budget at the same time  that means short  amp  long distance buses regional trains   important  i am studying japanese and henceunication doesn t worry me at all here s a draft of a general route and direction  very rough sketch  i have in mind for a 21 day trip in spring 2021  which i guess will make things more difficult due to being national travel season 1  days 1 4  gt  tokyo and surrounding towns depending on what i feel like visiting  i have the basics covered 2  days 5 8  gt  travelling north towards fukushima prefecture  probably via ibaraki 3  days 9 11  gt  travelling southwest towards nagano  via gunma or even through niigata s coast 4  days 12 16  gt  travelling towards kyoto via gifu and through the north side of lake biwa 5  days 17 21  gt  from osaka to tokyo on more or less a straight line i realise we are talking about hundreds of km s  but i don t want to coast through them on a bullet train nor pay the absurd prices of a jr pass anyway  i can afford it  i just would prefer not to  i prefer to sit 3h every day on a countryside bus or a diesel train looking through the window than seeing this or that  i cane back next year but  is that even possible in a country that relies so much on high speed trains  technically i could just go to the bus station in nagano and in 30min time get a bus that takes me to matsumoto  or half way  but will that actually be the case or will i generally be told toe next day since all sits are taken  thinking about population density   frequency  what about smaller towns where  i am guessing  frequency is the main issue  considering the amount of transportation i ll be using  is a jr pass the better option even if it costs more than buses regional trains  or all things considered it will cost the same but i ll have more flexibility  to me  the problem with the jr pass is how it forces you to use it due to being limited in time  if there s a festival in the next town or a hike i didn t know about  i want to be able to postpone taking the train for 1 or 2 days without thinking about the money i ve already invested on the jr pass  i could go for the 21 day pass  but the price is outrageous  for what i ve read  a suica card could give me the flexibility of not having to worry about paper tickets  calculating prices or having to step in the ticket office  but is that actually true  can i just hop on nearly any bus train in the countryside smaller cities and use the card as if i was using it to travel through tokyo s metro system  what happens if the train station is too small to have employees  is there someone on the train that charges you for the ticket other things i ve been considering  i am not planning on getting mobile internet  i want to focus on using my hard earned adventure skills to get from a to b   and there s many wifi spots anyway for when i really need to use the internet  i ll take a sleeping bag for emergencies  last train situations  etc  should i also carry a small tent in case i am stuck somewhere in the countryside  i can sleep anywhere and i understand japan s thought on the matter  but ultimately there s no need to do so if i can be certain i ll find a bed somehow that takes a last minute request  i am a very frugal person and i don t like to pay much for things  although i don t mind making exceptions if needed  a hostel capsule hotel is enough for me  but i don t want to miss on the occasional ryokan experience  or hotel with an onsen  i don t need to eat sushi from a restaurant when a konbini will do  but i d go to a restaurant for a cheap bowl of noodles or a plate of curry  i don t usually buy tickets to visit places  i am happy to see them from outside  and so on  what i mean by this is that i am not strict on where and how money should be spent  even if that means skipping on key experiences  thoughts on how to do this while in japan and still enjoy the experience finally  i am thinking about spending around 1500  for a 21 day trip   500  on return plane tickets  i guess i could go higher for this first time in japan  up to 3000  in total  but i ve never spent so much money at once before so i don t know if i would feelfortable thank you all in advance for your help cheers ,1

2021 sakura itinerary  wife s first trip ,i have been to japan 3 times now  but this will be my wife s first time  we are huge foodies  so that will always be a major angle of the trip  other than that  she s fairly open to what we might find  i m trying to setup a trip that doesn t have too much crossover with things i ve done previously so that we might get to experience the wonder together  that being said  even  touristy  things like fushimi inari are worth the trip and that happens to be at the top of her list as always insights and suggestions are wee  especially around tokyo my wife said she does want to check out a maid cafe as well  so any suggestions are wee    day schedule mar 25th fly to kix mar 26th land in osaka   6 15pm get rail pass and wifi aodations in shinsekai where we will roam and eat the first night if we can t sleep mar 27th unsure about morning  but osaka castle or open air museum of old japanese farm houses is on the list dotonbori for lunch this is the second to last day of the osaka sumo tournament  we plan to pre purchase tickets and be there by 2pm or so to watch the last part of the day with the larger crowds and best wrestlers dotonbori for dinner probably since there is so much food to try mar 28th morning in osaka  nothing decided yet noon shinkansen to hakata check in lunch   ramen at canal city  window shopping probably yatai food stalls that night for dinner mar 29th shofukuji and kushida shrines in the morning subway to maizuru and ohori park  bike rentals instead maybe lunch momichi beach ferry to uminonakamichi trains back to canal city for 2nd night of yatai  mar 30th leave hakata in the morning and arrive in kobe hakutsuru sake brewery   museum kobe near sannomiya for lunch then on to kyoto  staying walking distance from gion kyoto evening undecided  possibly side trip to omihachiman for canals and dinner   mar 31st nishiki market higashiyama philosopher s path april 1st fushimi inari very early  probably stay several hours  possibly hiking the entire loop  this is at the top of my wife s list so we will spend extra time here open mid afternoon dinner with maiko that night in gion april 2nd leave in morning to tokyo stop in yokohama for ramen museum for lunch continue on to fuji 5 lakes  yeah  it s a bit of a trek for the day but we will have a good 2 hour ramen break in between the trains relax in our private onsen in our room that night  staying near kawaguchiko station april 3rd rent bikes and bike around the lake and across the bridge probably will do the ropeway visit the wind cave and ice cave  there is a bus  and it s schedule will determine what order the day goes in evening of rest and relaxation in hotspring april 4th stop at the chureito pagoda in the morning when we leave head to tokyo   staying in shinagawa the entire time evening will probably consist of shibuya  whoopigoldburger first night is really open for anything april 5th this will focus on the western side of tokyo only thing fully decided on is harajuku and omoide yokocho  everything else is open april 6th disney april 7th eastern side of tokyo ueno  asakusa  akiba  we have food places picked out  but specifics are still being worked on april 8th the day we leave  probably do things close to  shinagawa until it s time to head to haneda airport amp x200b some other notes and tidbits  a side trip to nikko has been discussed  but since it would likely take an entire day  we feel that any tokyo exploration might get crunched  we really wanted to go to shirakawago and takayama  but it takes so much time in travel  that we felt the entire trip would suffer and be rushed to aodate it  unless there is some other way to organize this  thank you all for your insights and suggestions ,1

 itinerary check  april 15 25 2021  tokyo  kyoto ,hi all  my friends and i are all planning  if we can travel  on flying into tokyo on april 16th  i was able to get a rt flight for 460 so i could not pass that up  we are all traveling from either a different state or country and our landing times are all within an hour or so of each other so we are prepared to wait for the others as others have mentioned  it has been extremely tough to plan this because it is just so foreign to me  we re all gamers and do want to see some anime things and whatnot  but only for maybe a day  if that  we have yet to book any aodations yet since most air bnbs didn t have the most friendly cancellation policies but i have noticed a lot have switched to a more flexible option  i wanted to stay in the shinjuku area  saw some air bnbs a little west  everything will be prepaid except for metro money  non jr food shopping misc so we don t really have a budget but i imagine about 1k each this is what i havepiled so far and i am open to changing  altering  taking off  ignoring  day 1  land at narita around 3pm wait on others either take the nex or a cab  we re aware how expensive they are but we might be so tired that it might not matter  explore around our air bnb  find a bar and relax  if you think we can squeeze something in here please let me know  day 2   shinjuku  amp  shibuya  some of us want to do a themed cafe and we re willing to do touristy things even if they re overpriced    meiji shrine  shibuya crossing  harajuku  golden gai for drinks later  parks  what im having trouble here is deciding what should be first  second etc  day 3   asakusa  amp  ueno  day 4   kyoto  here we plan on activating our jr pass to take the bullet train to kyoto    arashiyama  amp  sagano  day 5   kyoto day 2    kinkakuji  amp  ginkakuji  day 6   kyoto day 3    half day trip to nara  explore rest of kyoto  onsen  day 7   return to tokyo  kamakura  day 8   half or full day trip to hakone nikko  day 9   nikko hakone maybe  day 10  go homeas you can see  days 7 8 9 are either too much  or not enough  please suggest some other things to add or take off  we re okay with seeing anything  we have nothing against  too much of this  or  too much of that  the reason we are activating the jr pass on day 4 is so we can do the day trips plus the airport train  we will be getting a suica card for intra tokyo  some questions i have are  should i even do so many day trips  do i have enough  should i even do kyoto and just spend the whole time in tokyo i think once i can narrow down the area  i can figure out things to do within  please critique update  after giving it the weekend to think about it  since i m the one planning  i decided that we will be staying in tokyo all  9 days and making day trips instead  we will leave kyoto for another trip  the day trips will be hakone  nikko  and kamakura  i m iffy on kamakura  so if you have any other ideas for day trips please let me know  i don t think the jr pass will be needed so if there are any other passes we can purchase please let me know  back to the drawing board ,1
 itinerary check  11 days in april 2021   tokyo  budget trip ,hey guys so i was supposed to head to tokyo for halloween but due to covid i had to reschedule  i am going to be trying for  hopefully if covid allows us  april 5th of 2021 for 11 days  i wanted to get some feedback of my itinerary and possible suggestions for the last few days of the trip  just to tell you a little bit about myself and my group  we are all gamers and love to play retro  pc and  next gen games  we are a huge fan of arcades  anime  and wrestling  we are going to be sticking together for most of the trip  we are on a budget and trying to save as much as we can to spend more on shopping  and trying to enjoy the food   we were looking at the ebisu circut in  nihonmatsu shi  but not really sure how far and if its worth it  in addition we saw a few places like hakone and yokohama that aren t too far away but we just aren t sure if its worth packing up from the hotel traveling there for a day or two anding back  any suggestion you guys can offer would be great  we would love to check out more of the temples and shrines  in addition to anything gaming or anime related  i probably should have mentioned this but a few of us restricted to a vegetarian and vegan diet so are there places that have these options this is a wip so far but i have a good idea of what we at least wanted to do day 1  fly into narita airport around 3pm and then heading to taito to check into our hotel  after checking in we are just wanting to roam around akihabara for the remainder of the day to experience japan and do some small shopping day 2  updated  per rendations 8 13 2020  meiji jingu first thing in the morning  kawaii monster cafe for lunch afterwards just walking around harujuku  shibuya for parco to check out the nintendo and pokemon stores as well as purchase our disney tickets  after this i would assumed we would still be jet lagged and pretty tired so we would head back to the hotel for some rest day 3  updated  per rendations 8 13 2020  we wanted to check out the studio ghibli museum in the morning  on the way back to shibuya we wanted stop by nakano broadway for shopping  based on the feedback some mentioned after leaving nakano it is evening time so we were thinking if we still have the energy we could check out maruhan pachinko and or bar hopping day 4  updated  per rendations 8 13 2020  tokyo disney sea all day day 5  updated  per rendations 8 13 2020  sensoji temple in the am before it gets super busy  sky tree at 5pm to watch the sunset  placeholder for new japan pro wrestling otherwise just wandering around and enjoying the views day 6  updated  per rendations 8 13 2020  spending a day in odaiba and just enjoying everything including the gundam statue  we would probably do the boat ride day 7  updated  per rendations 8 13 2020   akihabara in the morning    ueno park in the evening as a few people told me the park is lit up and a beautiful place to check out the cherry blossoms day 8  updated  per rendations 8 13 2020  spend a day in ikebukuro and check out places like the pokemon center  maybe round 1 and the aquarium day 9  updated  per rendations 8 13 2020  day trip in yokohama checking out places like the kirin brewery  we love beer tasting  and then cup of noodles museum  the rest is just kinda wandering around day 10  updated  per rendations 8 13 2020  this day is to makeup for whatever we might have missed or have to make up since new japan pro wrestling doesn t have an official date yet  if it falls during one of the prior days then we would use this day to fill in for what we missed day 11  last minute sight seeing and enjoying the city before flying out at 5pm through haneda airport ,1

going to yakushima  help ,hello  my girlfriend and i are planning to travel from the kanagawa area to yakushima  i am aware that this requires a long train ride and a ferry ride  but we got an amazing deal on a place to stay for the month so we have to go  i am wondering what some advice would be on taking a night bus versus taking the shinkansen  i have had very limited success looking up how to purchase a ticket for the night bus  whereas the shinkansen seems much of a simpler process  but more expensive  i am wondering  are there any resources for buses that i may not be aware of  also for anyone with experience  how do we buy tickets for the ferry from kagoshima to yakushima  another question  can we buy shinkansen tickets for a specific day at a station in advance thank you so much edit  thank you all so much  this was all super helpful  i think we will end up taking the shinkansen  we have a few bags with us so after the bag fees and seat choice fee  i think it may end up being around the same price as the shinkansen  also  i just learned of tanegashima so we will be visiting there as well  also a follow up question if anyone reads this  can jaoan take away a visa for not paying the national health insurance  we accidentally got on the wrong health insurance  and not the one where your employer handles everything  now we have about  500 usd in debt to the gov  wondering what will be the consequences of this  a little scared ,1

itinerary check   nov 14 28th 2020   advice on hakone  amp  shuzenji onsen,hey all  i m currently trying to organise a rather flexible plan for a trip in november  i m very aware the whole thing could be off due to the pandemic  which is why despite booking the flights last year  no aodation is booked at the moment and hence the rather slow cautious planning regarding an itinerary  no theme parks and big events that may close fyi this will be my third trip to japan and my friends first  so i ve tried to do a mix of new and stuff my friend wouldn t want to miss  i m mainly concerned about whether i ve got a good balance of things   friend is mainly interested in food  nature  castles temples  onsen  small town atmosphere and i personally love the visual overload of the cities and super quiet small towns 14 11  london   haneda airport   tokyo arriving around 10am  check in hotel early afternoon  casual sightseeing and food  maybe akihabara shinjuku  activate jr pass  14 day  get suica passmo 15 11  tokyo   himeji   kinosaki onsen leave early for the big ride  drop luggage in coin lockers at himeji  see the castle and gardens before moving onto kinosaki onsen for a evening of cafes  yukata and lots of onsens 16 11   kinosaki onsen   kyoto enjoy the morning in kinosaki before going onwards to kyoto 17 11  a full day in kyoto i ve feel as if i ve done a lot of kyoto and could skip it  however  i feel like my friend shouldn t miss it  plus there s always stuff you miss  will be mainly avoiding arayashiyama area though due to being based there on my last trip to japan  potentially might travel to osaka in the evening to save hassle on travelling in the morning 18 11  kyoto   osaka base around namba area  want to see  shinsaibashi  amerikamura  osaka castle  kurumon market  end up in dotonburi in the evening  potentially go to the bunraku theatre and see kabuki or puppets 19 11  osaka   mt koya san  day trip visit tenma for food in the evening  head over to shinsekai for the lights 20 11  osaka   nara unsure to make this a day trip or stay the night  general mooching around  see the deer and temple 21 11  nara osaka    mishima   shuzenji onsen or hakone shinkansen to mishima  coin locker luggage and get the bus to mishima sky walk   hopefully  get a good view of fuji sanbefore heading to shuzenji onsen or hakone  i ve been to hakone before  loved it and friend wants to go  shuzenji appears to have small town atmosphere and looks lovely and ticks a lot of boxes  wondering if anyone has been to both and could give advice on whether shuzenji is more worthwhile than hakone  i m leaning towards shuzenji more due to less tourists and because i ve never been but can see that it could be unfair to friend to deprive of hakone  advice on this would be great thank you 22 11  hakone or shuzenji full day hakone  do the loop   owakudani and hakone shrine  lake ashinoko shuzenji  get the bus to kawazu seven waterfalls trail  see the wasabi fields  check out kawazu before getting the bus back to shuzenji 23 11  shuzenji hakone   tokyo big travel day  arrive and base in asakusa 24 11  asakusa   nikko  day trip see the temples  lots of nature  i m aware that it s going to be very busy in autumn 25 27 11  tokyo exploration potentially go to kamakura  amp  enoshima on a side trip  but thought it would be nice to leave these days open for souvenir shopping and general tokyo fun 28 11  haneda airport   london sorry for the long post  but mainly looking to see if anything seems off  minus maybe getting a 14 day jr pass instead of a 7   but felt like we were rushing everywhere with a 7  and advice on shuzenji and hakone as mentioned above thank you ,1
yakushima without a car,so im continuing to plan for a japan trip even though its been postponed for a few years  note that the plan is to go during may after golden week  one of the places we re planning on going is yakushima and currently we plan on not renting a car since driving in a country where we dont speak or read the language is kind of terrifying to us  we dont mind taking things slower and if we dont see the entire island  we tend to be very laid back when traveling  the plan is to spend 4 nights on the island  arriving early the first day and leaving midday on our last  what im wondering is if anyone who has been there can let me know their thoughts on us relying on the bus system there to get around  we enjoy walks and hiking so walking places are no problem to us  but i d hate to plan something for our group and then have it be a waste of thier limited time in japan ,1
question about following a specific diet while in japan, answered    thank you  i want to visit japan someday  but before i make any actual plans i thought it d be good to ask this question  is following a low protein phenylalanine diet possible to do in japan  i have to follow such a diet for my pku phenylketonuria  i can have a decent amount of phenylalanine with little to no issue  but i still need to be careful since it adds up throughout the day edit  i thought it d be helpful to specify what i can eat  since it s a little different for everyone with pku  i can eat rice and noodles just fine  and most veggies as well  tofu i have to be careful of beans  nuts  and meat i try to avoid but can eat in rare occasions  dairy products   eggs especially i can never eat  i think i ll be ok if i go but i wanted to ask just in case ,1

looking for tips advice on japanese customs before a mc touring trip ,hey all don t know if this is the right sub for these kind of things but i ll give it a go and hopefully someone can guide me in the right direction if it s not me and hubby are planning to go to japan next summer for about 3 4 weeks of mc touring  we have looked into renting but it is in all seriousness flabberghastingly expensive  well atleastpared to other countries we ve visited  so  instead of renting we are looking into how much it would cost to ship our own bike  ktm 990 adventure for those dying to know  d  ande to realization that it probably would be less expensive  which to me is equally flabberghasting since we live on precisely the opposite side of the globe  anyhow  what i need some help with is regarding  japanese customs tariffs anything else related  if anyone have done something similar or have experience with japanese customs regarding import export it would be greatly appreciated worth noting may be that we have not decided on which port we re going to transport to but the ones we ve looked into are tokyo and osaka  this because we found a shippingpany who sail there but if you have some other suggestion regarding port we re all ears  and as i wrote before  please do not hesitate to give me a fingerpoint in the right direction if wrong sub to post in  lt 3  also  i ve posted this in the motorcycles sub  so i guess this is a repost ,1

3 week itinerary late february   march 2021   advise check practicability,hello everyone  we  me 26  husband 28  wanted some opinions on our japan trip  were planning to go for 3 weeks  or maybe  4 if our trip gets canceled for a year  were planning to go late february begin march hopefully in 2021 if things don t work out we will go around the same time in 2022 my first post was removed due to lack on information and using general questions so i m here to try again  thank you for the ones that responded on my previous post it already helped a lot  so here is our more detailed itinerary  hopefully i get it right this time  if not please let me know so i can change it our budget is  8000 10 000  we expect a average amount of  120 a night and  100 for food a day  our general interests are scenery  temples  gardens  castles  forests  food  shopping and also things like anime and arcades were planning to get the jr pass and both get a wifi sim card  we do want to take two medium suitcases and both a normal sized backpack to take on walks and some tote bags for shopping  our idea is to get a hotel ryokan rinn close to a station if that s an option so we don t need to carry our luggage too much and try to take trips with as little layovers to prevent the carrying staircase trap but if it occurs were okay with that were not experienced travelers and like to take it slow and soak things in rather than pack each day with a lot of activities  also some room to rest and take it easy if we get overwhelmed  ofc we can do multiple things if some things don t end up to take a lot of time my main concern and my personal weakness is traveling  by train  i get easily lost and confused and try to make things as smooth as possible before we get there  the only thing that stresses me out it the trip from tokyo to takayama and osaka to koyasan  were also not sure if were wanting to take it to kanazawa from takayama since were so close but for now it s not listed in the itinerary disclaimer  please note that if there is a day not filled out or says something like  nothing planned yet   that it s not a cry for help or for you to fill it in it just means we re still looking in to that and were not planning everyday ahead our trip looks like this tokyo 4 nights   akihabara area   apa hotel kodemmacho ekimae arriving  day 1    we re probably landing at narita airport in the morning  8 00 9 00  get our jr pass and simcards and take the express to tokyo city after we get to our hotel were going to fresh up take a rest and explore the area a bit so we get a feel of our surrounding area for the uing days and take it easy till the next day day 2    wander around akihabara  shopping try some ramen  and if we still feel fresh try some arcades in the evening day 3    try to get up early to go to tsukiji outer market after we plan to go see asakusa and surrounded area s  get back to akihabara and go to some theme cafe s and see what we still feel like  we would like to eat at beef restaurant  sakuraya musashi  in the evening day 4    early travel for a nikko day trip and get back to the hotel afterward and go for some drinks or arcades or both amp x200b takayama 2 nights   hodakaso sanganoyu hotel ryokan day 5    early travel to takayama  it looks like a long ride so we plan take the day off after arriving  we want to stay at hodakaso sanganoyu hotel ryokan and thy to get to their  private  onsen to charge up for the next day amp x200b day 6    full day explore old town and try some hida beef amp x200b kyoto 4 nights   rinn kyomachi   we might add kanazawa between takayama and kyoto so the trip would be from kanazawa instead of kyoto not sure yet day 7    early travel to kyoto were planning to stay at rinn kyomachi a modern japanese style vacation home so we can get a break from the hotels and cook some of our own meals day   8  gt  10  here we don t have planned day by day yet but we want to go to fushimi inari taisha  gion  kinkaku ji  ginkaku ji  kiyomizudera  arashiyama in these days amp x200b hiroshima 2 nights day 11    travel to hiroshima  explore museum and city try some okonomiyaki along the way day 12    miyajima island see the deers  take a slow hike and try to get some momijimanju amp x200b osaka 3 nights     apa hotel  amp  resort midosuji hommachi eki tower day 13    travel to osaka go to the city to explore get some drinks and food and see what we feel like that day maybe dontonbori do some shopping day 14    see osakajo nothing more for this day yet we thought on going for a day trip to kobe if we can find time to do that day 15    nara day trip to see the deer amp x200b koyasan 1 night   shojoshin in temple stay day 16    travel to koyasan and stay at a temple we had shojoshin in in mind but not set on it yet  we want te explore the area and see okunoin day 17    wake up early for the morning ritual and get to hakone in the day amp x200b hakone 1 night   kukuna resort kukuna resort is way to far away so we are looking for a different place instead   day 18    travel to hakone we wanted a stay with mountain view and had the idea to splurge and stay at kukuna resort for one night  we plan to go see hakone shrine amp x200b tokyo 3 nights day 19    travel back to tokyo to stay in diffrent area maybe shibuya shinjuku day 20  gt  21  we did not plan it day by day here we wanted to take this time to do the things we could not do the first time or if our jetlag got in the way before  we did think about going to teamlab borderless museum and hesitate to go to disney sea for one day amp x200b narita 1 night day 22     we thought it would be a good idea becouse we can use te jr pass to get to narita on the day it expires so its less stressfull if our flight back takes of early in the morning  also we can spend the last day fully in tokyo  day 21  before taking the express to narita  sleep and go back on the 22th day instead of taking a flight on 21th day this was lot of read thank you for making it this far  i m open for any changes and opinions   i hope it got enough information and it s not too general like last time  if anyone got experiences with the places were staying in i would love to hear about it if that s allowed  and curious if the route we picked is logical and doable or that there is any hick ups we can not easily find online we also thought that if we can t go in early 2021 maybe autumn is nice too  we wondered if it has effect on some of the area s we wanted to visit or there are problems with transport because of the weather and last  is there any space to add kanazawa and is it worth it to add to the list or is that too much for 3 weeks sorry if a day got skipped or messed up  also not my first language    edit  space between lines grammaredit  switched the order of introduction  everything said stayed the same  edit  hakone stay add on ,1

steel  knife or sword making in tokyo,hello i have had a good search on this sub regarding knives  swords and steel but unfortunately they are overwhelmingly about where to buy  rather than where to see them being made  i want to ask whether there are any locations where my wife to be and i could experience watch any knife  sword or steel making in the tokyo area or in the north of tochigi prefecture the reason why i am asking is because my wife to be is half japanese and we met at university on a material s science degree course  i now work in the steel industry in the uk so we thought it would be a cool thing to do on our honeymoon thank you,1
trip report   2 weeks in september 2019   cities  sea and sake ,trying to relive my holiday to japan last year and decided to write up this trip report to help me reminisce  and hopefully help a few of you guys with planning your trips overview i  25m from london  visited japan in september 2019 for two and a half weeks with my parents and sister  we used the rugby world cup as a great excuse to visit japan  a country we ve always wanted to visit  i ll keep the rugby stuff to a minimum but naturally the games dictated where we needed to be on certain days  there is plenty on this subreddit about logistics so i ll only lightly cover some points but happy to answer any questions in theents  on the weather  we were very lucky fitting out trip between two typhoons  it was generally warm with only a couple rain showers which we were able to avoid day 1   tokyo we flew into haneda airport direct from london and arrived at out hotel  the  asakusa view hotel  in the morning  it s a good  if not outstanding  upmarket hotel with a delicious buffet breakfast  most japanese hotels are strict with their check in times so we left our bags in the hotel reception to explore  we strolled to the gorgeous  senso ji  then climbed the tokyo skytree  worth it for the immense  urban sprawl of tokyo  after returning to the hotel  we headed out for dinner on  hoppy street  a bustling street with restaurants pouring out onto the road  we ate a series of small plates in place not even on google maps but i ve  plonked you in front of it  on street view  before heading back to the hotel for a night cap       day 2   tokyo took the metro easily enough to tokyo station where we sorted our jr pass before window shopping in the upmarket  ginza   afterwards we headed to shibuya and got an elevated view of the  crossing  from the starbucks   i d rend a walk down cat street where with its eclectic architecture and fashion shops  we then headed over to shinjuku where we found a  restaurant  where you ordered off ipads at your table for fried chicken and beer and headed into  golden gai  and picked a bar at random for some drinks  its something you ve got to try      day 3   tokyo we hired a tour guide for a half day to show us some sights and give us some insight and history we might otherwise have missed  it s not something we usually do on our trips and while not essential  i would rend it  we headed to the  tsukji fish market  and enjoyed the free samples and wide variety of produce  afterwards we walked into the gardens of the  imperial palace  which while pretty were not the most exciting   we then travelled over to  meiji jingu  where  at around 12 30pm  we were lucky enough to see some wedding processions  our guide then left us at a delicious  ramen  place nearby   oreryu shio ramen  where you ordered from a machine outside   we headed back to the hotel via a street corner with some sketchy looking   mystery vending machines  and marvelled at every product devised by man in  yodobashi camera  later i headed out to meet up with a school friend who was in tokyo for work  he had got put in contact with a friend of his boss who took us to multiple local hangouts  including some great  sashimi  in an  izakaya   although maybe that was the sake talking   day 4   yokohama to the nissan stadium to watch ireland v scotland  lawson came in handy for plenty of cans of beer and onigiri  it was really great to see the locals getting into the rugby spirit day 5   tokyo   takayama a very hungover shinkansen ride  firstly to nagoya  we had a good bit of time until our next train so grabbed a cab to  nagoya castle  it was hot but worthwhile with some well renovated buildings to walk through   back at nagoya station and  with bento boxes in hand  we took a local train through the  stunning valleys  of the japanese alps  we finally arrived in the small town of hida takayama  gifu where we were staying in a small  outstanding  ryokan  the hospitality was perfect and we had an obscene  9 course dinner  with each course put together like an art work      day 6   takayama we spent the day in the quiet village of takayama  a total step change to tokyo  watching the early morning fisherman in the miyagawa river  we visited the museum showcasing the village s okoshi daiko festival  which looks like it would be a one in a lifetime experience to visit for real  then we visited the wooded   keta wakamiya shrine  at the edge of the village  we were the only people there which allowed for a special  serene experience  after lunch in what i can only describe as an old lady s front room we walked through the centre of the village  with  rivers of koi fish  running along the streets  after popping out heads in a sake brewery we headed back to the ryokan where we took it easy for the rest of the afternoon and i soaked away my troubles in the outdoor onsen     day 7   takayama   kyoto got on the train in the morning and winded out way through the landscape to kyoto  we were staying in a modern but traditionally inspired  machiya townhouse   just a 5 minute walk from  kiyomizu dera  so naturally that was our first stop  managing to catch the most gorgeous sunset as we arrived  that evening we walked through the  geisha district  looking for a place to eat but found all the prices to be obscene so ended up in a nice local bar specialising in ramen and tempura        day 8   kyoto  amp  kobe we had heard about the huge crowds at the  fushimi inari shrine  so managed to beat the crowds by getting up early  we arrived at 7 30am and it was plenty quiet enough to enjoy and get some instagram shots if you re that way disposed   i would rend  hiking up  as least some of the way as well to get some great views back across the city   we then headed through the covered  nishiki market  which had lots of interesting stalls before heading to kyoto station  the station is gigantic and we headed up the  longest set of escalators  ever to have some tasty okonomiyaki  the reason for visiting the station was to head to our next match  scotland v samoa in kobe  it wasn t a long journey and allowed us to return to kyoto the same night     day 9   kyoto today was spent on local buses  criss crossing kyoto visiting the myriad castles and temples  including nijo castle  kinkaku ji and the imperial palace  i was most impressed with kinkaku ji  the  golden pavilion  while very busy  the reflections of the golden building against the pond that surrounds it are well worth the visit  that evening  after dinner in a quiet but nice dumpling and udon  restaurant   i met up with a friend of mine also out in japan for the rugby  he took me to a great standing bar he stumbled on  popular with locals called  suiba  here we drank copious amounts of sake out of the traditional masu wooden box     day 10   kyoto  amp  nara popular on everyone s list  including mine  was a day trip to nara  it s not just about the deer here  get lost in the park and enjoy all the  different temples  it has to offer dotted around the park  the deer really do eat anything though   including our guide book  so watch out  we fancied a change in diet in nara and could rend the  mellow caf  for some great  gourmet pizza  back in kyoto we had a drink in the atlantis bar  it s on a great narrow street filled with bars and restaurants and i d rend paying slightly more to be able to sit out on a terrace overlooking the kamo river     day 11   kyoto   miyajima after leaving kyoto our first stop today was hiroshima  where we immediately took the bus to the peace memorial museum  it is a sobering experience which doesn t shy away from the horrors of what happened here  an ufortable but essential visit  we then walked over to the  atomic bomb dome  which again is hauntingly beautiful and walked back to the station via thepact but lovely  castle   we then boarded a local train to the ferry crossing for mijajima island  the itsukushima shrine was  covered in scaffolding  where we were there  this can happen a lot on a trip  we knew this before we arrived but after we d booked out night s aodation on the island  i have to say it was gutting because the scenery was amazing  even more so at night  the trip was enjoyable regardless  we caught the ropeway up the mountains to get some  great views of the sea  dotted with islands  we were staying in another  ryokan  and this was a bigger affair and slightly more like a hotel but still a great experience  with another huge dinner and opportunity to use the onsen        day 12   miyajima   kobe back to kobe for another rugby match  england v usa  this time however we stayed in kobe  in the functional  daiwa roynet hotel  which allowed us to indulge in some drunken karaoke in the evening  we found an  amusement arcade  with karaoke in sound proofed rooms  which i m sure the staff were grateful for to avoid our atrocious singing      day 13   kobe   tokyo before heading back to tokyo we visited the museum on the kobe earthquake of 1995  to be honest it was more catered to educating local school children about earthquakes than set up for tourists  and rightly so  with little information in english  so i wouldn t rend it too highly  we took the shinkansen back to tokyo where we stayed in the swanky  new  gate hotel  after freshening up we headed to the bright lights of shunjuku and to the  robot restaurant  is it a huge tourist trap  yes  did i have a great time  yes  it s over the top  kitsch fun and i d gladly go again  skip the food however and just enjoy the show    day 14   tokyo we met up with some local family friends in the morning who took us to a  conveyor belt sushi restaurant  with long lines that i d put down to its delicious  fresh sushi  afterwards we headed out of the centre of town to koenji which had a load of vintage clothes shops to cover every taste  returning back into town we had  yakitori  under the railway arches  with the  grills filling the air with smoke day 15   tokyo our final  full day of adventuring before heading back home  we decided to visit  teamlab borderless  in the morning and were glad we did  all the exhibits are beautifully conceived and each provides a unique assault on the senses  we then took a ride on the ferris wheel next door  because why not  and headed over to odaiba seaside park where we caught a  futuristic looking boat  all the way along the river to asakusa  providing a cool way to see the city  clearly the ferris wheel has ignited something in us as we decided to go on the rollercoaster by the tokyo dome  there was no queue so treated ourselves to two rides each  a high octane end to the trip of a lifetime summary i hoped some of the things i was lucky enough to do on my trip inspired some of you  some places i visited were tourist hotspots and some were obscure local haunts  what i think makes any trip special though it making it your own  we didn t necessarily seek all the places we visited out but stumbled across them  they were perfect in that time and in that place  go and make out your own adventure  there is something exciting around every corner in japan  enjoy ,1

capsule hotel to capsule hotel  sensible or not sensible for a 7 day trip ,so im making early plans to go to japan if the universe allows it by febuary 2021  ive been researching things i need to know and have before i go and i will be going solo  i thought about hotels and wondered how necessary they were since im planning on doing alot of traveling through out different parts of japan and wondered if staying in capsule hotels would be more sensible since theyre cheaper  from what ive heard  and i dont need to worry about staying in one place for no more than a day and one night  unless there are better ideas besides capsule hotels but since ill be hopping from one location to another in japan for a 7 day trip idk if regular hotels are all that necessary  it will be my first trip outside the states so i m trying to learn as much as possible now before it even happens  and any other tips you can give aswell  im trying to get to know more about transportation as well from tokyo to like hokkaido and any of the neighboring cities  i dont want to make dumb spending mistakes when ites to finding someplace to sleep and transportation  of course this is all depending on where we are with the covid situation by then ,1
itinerary review  two weeks in kyushu,hi all  my so and i are planning our second trip to japan  a little over a year ago we spent three incredible weeks exploring honshu  this time  we want to road trip across kyushu over two weeks  assuming travel restrictions are lifted  we will be flying into fukuoka the evening of 5 10 2021  and departing on the 23rd  we will be renting a car for the entirety of our trip   here  is a map of our tentative route  i understand this itinerary is fast paced  there were several legs of our trip last year where we were traveling to a different location each day  given that experience  i feelfortable with this pace  but please let me know if any part of this seems outright infeasible to you  specific questions are listed below the itinerary amp x200b day location notes 5 10 fukuoka evening arrival 5 11 fukuoka 5 12 saga prefecture visit hirado  and possibly arita and imari  ryokan in karatsu 5 13 nagasaki 5 14 kumamoto 5 15 kagoshima 5 16 ibusuki sand baths  then ferry to yakushima 5 17 yakushima first day of a two day hike across yakushima  cutting out first leg of traditional three day traverse by taxi 5 18 yakushima hike out and ferry back to ibusuki 5 19 kirishima long day hike in kirishima national park 5 20 takachiho drive up via nichinan coast  visit the gorge  shrine  etc 5 21 kurokawa check out aso san on the way  stay in ryokan 5 22 yufuin head back to fukuoka for lodging 5 23 fukuoka noon departure questions 1   how much time should i dedicate to hirado  imari and arita  this is potentially our most packed day in the whole trip  with three and a half hours of driving total and three possible locations  we may find lodging nearby the night before to shorten driving time  but currently the plan is to leave from fukuoka at 6am and arrive in hirado by 8am  grab breakfast and spend an hour or two biking around there  then if time permits head to arita and or imari  with a couple hours at each  we will retire to our ryokan in karatsu around 6pm  if i have to cut a location out  which would you say is the least interesting  i m definitely interested in ceramics textiles but i m more excited to bike around hirado and take in the coastline  i m hoping it s possible to hit all three 2   how much time would you rend between kurokawa and yafuin  which do you prefer   edit  someone mentioned below that yufuin is a tourist trap  beppu seems to be for sure  do people think this is true of yafuin as well 3   are there any hidden gems along the route you would rend over our chosen locations  we loved exploring more rural and residential areas on honshu  and enjoy getting to the less touristy corners of the country  walking the streets of japan is one of the great joys of traveling there  even if there aren t many  things to do 4   are there any great scenic drives we should include in our route  the ones we made sure to include so far were the kusasenrigahama yamanami highway drive near aso  kurokawa and yafuin  the nichinan coast drive  and then the drive along the coast in saga prefecture 5   can anyone rend specific ryokans in kyushu  based on our research we were thinking of going with  ryokan sanga  in kurokawa and  yoyokaku  in karatsu  yoyokaku is appealing due to it s traditional style  history and pottery  we re interested in sanga because it seems like the kaiseki there is pretty adventurous  these are both upper mid range ryokans  probably around ¥50 000 each  another option we re considering is foregoing two mid range ones in favor of one luxury ryokan   takefue  definitely piqued our interest  we are mostly looking for excellent regional cuisine  omotenashi  japanese hospitality  and atmosphere edit  after reading some of the feedback here we re considering cutting out sightseeing in saga prefecture to give us more time in fukuoka  we may also pass on kirishima since we ll have just finished a big hike in yakushima  also  we may cut out either kagoshima or kumamoto to give us more time in nagasaki  so a couple more questions  6   if i have to cut one location out  should it be kagoshima or kumamoto 7   is kirishima worth cutting out  i have mixed feelings about this  i do want more breathing room in the itinerary and we are going to be hiking in yakushima  but i ve heard kirishima is some of the best hiking in kyushu ,1

overnight stay at a temple ryokan   question to ladies,it s not like we plan our lives around when we have our period  but i have no idea what to do when i m travelling and stay at a place that only hasunal showers and baths  obviously wouldn t go into a bath  but i worry even showering would make other people ufortable  you re just trying to take a shower and then next to you all the water is red cause someone is on the red waterfall part of the month anyone had a dillema like this  i need advice if i should skip a trip or go for it,1
transiting through narita,hi all  i m set to travel back to the us from singapore in 2 days  and i need to transit through narita  i ve traveled frequently through narita  but that was pre covid  what does the airport look like for transit passengers  any tips to make the process go more smoothly for both myself and the health officials in the airport ,1
psa  jr east will be slashing its shinkansen fares by half until march 31  2021,due to the plunged tourist figures for the past few months  jr east will be cutting shinkansen fares by half for all of its trains until march 31 2021 except the hokuriku shinkansen kagayaki and hakutaka services to nagano  kanazawa and toyama  which the discount is only until september 30  2020  too early for foreign travel  take note that this only covers jr east trains  which means that the famous tokaido shinkansen route from tokyo to shin osaka is not covered  same goes that northbound trains only go as far as shin aomori  the hokkaido portion to shin hakodate is also not covered  while the covid 19 situation is still far flung  this is a good start for travelers once japan reopens for international tourism assessment  to sum it up  given the coverage of jr east shinkansen trains  this discount in theory makes better sense for domestic travelers  japanese citizens and permanent foreign residents  due to their ineligibility in purchasing jr east passes but if you are doing just one side trip from tokyo on certain areas requiring just a roundtrip shinkansen ticket and little anything else  this is a phenomenal option  if you are traveling a long distance side trip  tokyo to sendai  tokyo to niigata  or even tokyo to gala yuzawa  during winter  you will be at a much better position to avail these discounted tickets instead of wasting a jr east pass like the tohoku pass or the nagano niigata area pass  case in point of savings  a roundtrip ticket from tokyo to niigata costs a little over jpy 10 000 with the discount while the jr nagano niigata area pass costs around jpy 18 000  unless you will make use of more routes within the nagano niigata area as well as taking the narita express back home  the discounted roundtrip ticket makes more sense in contrast  far flung regions tokyo to shin aomori or akita are ridiculously expensive in purchasing shinkansen tickets alone  figure around jpy 18 000 on discounted roundtrip tickets  even with a discount  you may better be off purchasing the jr east tohoku area pass  which costs a few thousand yen more ,1
how to spend only 1350  for 14 days in japan   tips and trip report september 2019  1 week in kansai  1 week in kanto ,hello there japan enthusiasts second post on this subreddit  two years ago i asked you about your first time in japan  how you felt to hype me up  and it ended up being a pretty cool  thread  well since then  i ve been to japan twice and i ll share some tips on  how to spend 2 weeks in   for 1350 quid only which is not much at all why   i am a student and don t have that much money  and discovering new countries is something i love doing  especially since i went to japan the first time in 2018  i absolutely love this country and try to go once a year  that s why  as a broken student  i try to spend as little as possible while still being able to enjoy my trip to the fullest this advice trip report will be for people who don t mind sacrificing a bit of confort if it means saving a bunch there are two parts in this post  1st i explain how i spent 800 euros for aodation  flights and transportation from tokyo to osaka and back  second  i do a trip report  the first part is not very long so i rend reading   part i   let s talk about the stuff you need before you go first of all  if you want to go to japan  you ll need a plane ticket  unless you have a private jet with a pilot  but i doubt you d be reading this if that was the case  in my case  i travel from western europe  for this 14 day trip  i went to japan from september 13 to september 27  people will explain better than me what s the best time to visit japan since it depends on what you want to do  but i went in september because it was the rugby world cup  i was a bit lucky and dodged faxai and hagibis  typhoons i found tickets for 470e in early july after 1 or 2 months of scanning the prices every now and then and looking at trends  if you re travelling from europe  you re looking for tickets in the  450 550 euro range  in that price range  it will be lowcostpanies of course with dodgy food and limitedfort  but that s the point of the low budget trip  i took aeroflot  paris cdg to narita in 16 hours  instead of 12 13 hour flights  with an hour in moscow airport  flights were fine and had 3 seats for me on the way back  absolute bargain if you ask me second  you ll need aodation  in this trip format of 1 week in kansai and 1 week in tokyo  it doesn t matter which you do first  i went for kansai then tokyo as i had been to the capital before  so you re looking for cheap places to sleep   gt  capsule hotels can do the job  but it s boring  so i used hostels instead  met interesting people and paid about 12500  in both   i chose ark hostel in osaka and booked for 6 nights and sakura hotel in asakusa and booked for 6 nights also  i ll explain later why osaka for kansai third  for the stuff you need before you go is transportation from tokyo to osaka  you have several options  jr pass is not what you re looking for if you re staying 2 weeks in japan on a budget for tokyo and kansai  you can choose low cost airlines or night buses  personally i went for  nightbuses  paid about 70 euros for shinjuku   umeda  and 60 for namba   ikebukuro  planes also work but you need to  book early finally  the important point of this post is the kansai aodation   you only need one  osaka is the best base to sleep in kansai because you are in the middle of nara  kyoto and kobe  all are reachable with local trains in 35 40 minute rides with the suica card you use in tokyo   it s a strategic place and will make you save some money  the trains from osaka to these cities cost between 5 and 10 euros  so totally worth it  the good thing is that you can choose what day you go to kyoto  nara etc  it s up to you  plus osaka is the best between these cities during the night  i see too many guides and travel reports where people sleep in each town  it s cool but it s more of an hassle and it s only good if you stay in ryokans  which is not suitable for this kind of budget trip that makes us a total of around  800 euros  with flight  aodation and transportation from tokyo to osaka and back  to summerize what i mentionned in this segment of things you need before you go  i made this  graph  of what i did so overall  you get the general idea on how i limited costs with aodation and plane tickets and how to aim for 800 euros  in the following part  it will be more of a trip report  where i ll describe and narrate what i did and what i visited   in this case  how i spent the remaining 550 euros  rwc ticket  food  metro  museums  castles and beers basically  i ll share some tips and places to see  so feel free to continue the read  if you understood the concepts decribed above  then it s good enough for me and i hope it will have helped  how you spend your money once you are in japan is totally up to you of course    d   but i feel you should stick around because you might learn things    part ii   let s talk about  the stuff in japan   shall we 13 09  i arrived at 2pm in narita  my bus was at 23 30 for osaka in shinjuku  i was not meeting anyone that week  it was solo travel  i took the train to shinjuku and put my bags in lockers  i had 340  left on my suica card from my last trip  so i put 10000  back in  that was enough for the 2 weeks  i roamed around shinjuku   that s what i did  i roamed around shinjuku  walked in stores  just getting the vibes of the city as i was finally back in japan  it was good to be back  i went up the  metropolitan  building because that s always what you should do when you arrive  it s a free   great view  of tokyo  eventually  by the end of twilight  i went back in town  stopped in a konbini to get 2 onigiris and a peach suntory  went to grab my bags  and went to the station around 9pm  i ate and passed out on a bench in shinjuku station waiting for my bus with an alarm at 23 10 14 09  it was 6 30 am here in umeda  i slept a bit in the nightbus but i was still tired  i had to wait for my check in at 10 30 am  so i had 4 hours  it was my first time in osaka  eventually  the excitement took over my tiredness  as usual  i put my bag in lockers and went on exploring the  neighborhood  of my hostel   as you can see from that photo  it was still hot in september in osaka  around 29 c in the afternoon  quite enjoyable  the lockers are right under the higobashi station underground  they are easy to find and the station is just next to the hostel  time for check in at  ark hostel  wasing  i went to the hostel  did my bed and instantly slept  i slept until 5 or 6 pm  still kind of jetlagged  i figured i had to go for a evening night exploration so i walked in  town  again and explored a bit as i was looking for food  i remember finding a cheap rice bowl restaurant as you canonly find in japan  went back to the hostel eventually  talked to a roommate for a few minutes and went to sleep 15 09  i took my time that day  i wasn t rushed by having to take trains and stuff  i thought i d go for the  osaka castle  after finding a pocari sweat and onigiris  the castle costs 600   in that last photo with the castle  you see it from a spot a lot of people miss as they just walk straight to the castle  the spot is exactly   here  don t miss it   by the way  you have great   views   from the top of the monument  to visit the castle and do a tour of the park  it will take around 2 to 3 hours  later in the evening  i decided to go to  tsutentaku  great spot for street food   i devoured my takoyakis which is a dish from osaka  later i walked back to the hostel and went to bed because i was going to kyoto the next day and was really excited 16 09  walked to umeda station around 10am to take the train to go to kyoto  the train ride was cool looking at the cities passing by  i remember arriving in kyoto station and being amazed   it reminded me of a scene from my favourite anime  oregairu  where hachiman walks on top of the station  i rend going on top of the station  it s free  there are escalators if you are lazy and the   view   up there is good   i walked all the  way  to kiyomizu dera  a insane and famous temple of kyoto   as you have probably guessed  i love walking  but hey  it s free and it s good for you  also  it allows me to find the endangered species that is fanta peach  the best drink   anime river   by the way  walking also allows you to see the lesser known things  for instance i stumbled accross this beautiful   shrine   on the way  i was the only one   there  i walked my way up next to the cemetery and visited the  temple   a must do in kyoto  after that i went into the  old town  close by to seek for  food  as it was already probably 2 or 3 pm  i took the metro that follows the river down to fushimi inari shrine   i walked the whole thing  it was  awesome   once you re at the top  there s a place where you can walk a bit in woods  not far just like 50 meters  and enjoy a crazy   view  on a good day  if you look towards the south west you might see osaka and its harukas 300 skyscraper   it was getting late and i walked a whole lot that day  so i decided to take the metro back to kyoto station this time and then back to osaka  grabbed food and a sapporo in a konbini and went straight to bed after that 17 09  i went to nara that day  same as for kyoto  it was a 30 minute train ride more or less  i remember eating a great curry for like 900  on my way to the park  i took my time and explored the old town with its  pagodas  one thing i can t rend enough is walking   yes walking again  all the way up the  yakakusayama hill  it s about 500  to enter the hill park but the  views  are totally worth it  after that  i went  back  to the station  walking in the shotengai for a moment and headed back to osaka 18 09  that day i was going to kobe  you know the drill  30 minute train ride it is  from umeda  i didn t do anything fancy in  kobe  i just explored different neightborhoods  visited the center and went up the  kobe port tower  the red tower that costs 700  i don t know if i rend going to the top for 700  it s nice but the view isn t out of this world 19 09  back to kyoto  this time to the west side of the city  near the bamboo forest  this time i didn t take the train to kyoto station  i went directly to arashiyama   if you look on maps  you ll see it s a short walk to the shrines  gardens and bamboo forest  upon arriving  i rend walking on the left side of the katsura river for a bit  you get a   nice scenery  after walking along the river  i went to the  bamboo forest  it was pretty cool but i didn t expect that many people so be ready  close by i went to the  okochi sanso garden  which i highly rend  it costs 1000   but it s cool  went home after that  and walked a bit in osaka to catch the breeze of the night  found this  cool looking shop 20 09  final day in kansai  left hostel around 11am  i had the night bus at around 11pm  so i went to namba  put my bag in lockers and explored some parts of osaka i didn t go to  i went inside the  harukas  the ones that i could see in the distance from fushimi inari  i just stayed in that area  went in a manga shop  eventually when night came along  i decided to go a last time in tsutentaku  got this gorgeous  shot  it was raining and i was the only one without an umbrella i remember  but it was worth it  anyways  i took the bus and was on my way to tokyo 21 09  arrived in ikebukuro and took the yamanote line to ueno  i then walked my  way  to sakura hostel in  asakusa   there almost no one at 7 am at the temple  that was pretty cool  i had time since the bus arrived at 6am and i was checkin in at 10 am  i was so tired  i passed out on a bench near the sumida river waiting for 10 am  once i had checked in  i slept again for a bit  nothing much happened that day  it was a recovery day for me  and there was france argentina  rugby  on tv so i was pretty stoked 22 09  i woke up around 9 am for my day trip to yokohama  to visit the city and go to a rugby game   you guys know how it works  40 minutes train again for like 600  i walked around the city along the  sea  i really liked the general vibe of yokohama  it felt more relax than tokyo and the seaside was calming  had to go to the rugby game at the yokohama stadium which is a bit out of town  met my brother and his girlfriend for the  game  after the game  we went to a bar in town to watch the england game and to catch up 23 09  day in tokyo with my brother and his girlfriend  we went to odaiba  i highly rend walking on the rainbow bridge   everything involves walking it seems   i ll put the link to this   video   where the youtuber explains how to do it  it s free  dew it  the   views   are insane honestly  odaiba is pretty cool   i rend seeing the gundam statue and the miraikan museum for those who are into science  on the way back we stopped in shibuya  grabbed food and we went our separate ways from there 24 09  i didn t do much that day in the first half on the day  i was meeting japanese friends in the afternoon  so i decided to go to akihabara before just to have a look at things  akihabara is cool  especially if you love steins gate  i ate  there   not in the family ramen  but on the thing above when you go up the stairs on the left  but there is nothing to click on it  they sell ricebowls  porc and chicken  it s really good and around 600 1200  took yamanote line and met friends at hachiko statue  we strolled in yoyogi park the afternoon  and went for a nomihoudai in the evening for like 1700 25 09  i decided to have a chill day and go to chiba  one of the reasons is that there is inspiration there for the oregairu series  it s about as far as yokohama but to the east  i looked at the locations from this  post  on reddit where the guy explains where the spots are  rend if you like the anime  chiba is a cool city that is off the beaten path  i liked it there  so apart from the 500 2 yen train ride and the konbini food for lunchtime  didn t spend anything   even if you don t like or know about oregairu  i think chiba is worth visiting  especially if it s your second time in the tokyo area and you ve already seen the main things in tokyo 26 09  same as the previous day  but this time is was a  your name  pilgrimage  closer  in yotsuya  akasaka and shinjuku   this   guide   will explain better than anyone where to go for the pilgrimage  it s what i used  as you end up in the evening in shinjuku for the night photos  i decided to meet my friends again in shinjuku  we grabbed food at a burger king and went to a konbini to grab a few strong zeros  found a place to drink and had a good time  it was my last evening in tokyo  the last night is always nostalgic  headed home at around midnight and packed my bags 27 09  woke up at around 8 am to take the train to narita and off i went here you go  to summerize on this part  you can see i did quite a few things  you can manage to visit places even with a limited budget  after the first 800 euros of the first part  i used 10k yen as metro for 2 weeks in kansai and tokyo as i mentionned above  so that was about 900 euros  i used about 3000 yen in parks and museums  that s 925 euros  i had bought the rugby ticket a while ago  that was 60 euros  we re at 985 euros  i set my self about 2000 yen per day for food and konbini drinks and a bit more when i was with my brother or my friends  that s about 350 more euros so 1335euros  i bought a manga in akiba so that was 600  more  that s 1340  i remember setting myself 1350 euros on my trip account  and returned home with 9 euros  that s pretty much it conclusion  of course  i didn t eat wagyu beef  i didn t stay in a fancy ryokan  but that s out of question when you re travelling on a budget  i ll do that when i have a salary haha  but i feel like when you re in your early twenties  this type of trip works well  you get to do a lot of things while still being able to not break your wallet  anyways  i hope you enjoyed this post and had an insight on what it s like to visit japan for 2 weeks on a budget  this took me a while to write  looking back at my photos and stuff  i hope this advice will be helpful and i hope the pandemics cease in the near future so we can all enjoy what we love   travelling to japan    sayonara ,1
should i skip my trip to tokyo because of my weight ,my sister is studying in europe and for a program she gets the opportunity to travel abroad again and her choices were seoul and tokyo and she chose tokyo  she wants me toe and visit her after things die down a bit with the pandemic  i will most likely be visiting her next summer and i m currently 5 4 139lbs so i m still overweight and i get very anxious of being another fat dumb tourist that everyone hates  should i just let her know it s best i don t go ,1

a late  thank you  to japantravel,hey everyone amp x200b i doubt anyone reading now saw or even remembers my posts from a few months ago  but i ended up seeking a lot of advice on my itinerary and i just want to say thank you  i ended up going on the trip as planned  and given all the hurdles and situation  i still decided to go and visit japan  however skipped the other countries as stuff worsened globally  i am so glad i did though  i met so many great people and still experienced one of the best times of my life to date  i never explored anywhere alone  never got to travel across so much of one country either i think thisunity is great  i can totally see why people are so open to help another fellow traveler visit this beautiful country  after experiencing it alone  and at such a unique time  i understand that feeling of wanting to help others who will soon be doing it for the first time  i received so much advice  different opinions  and new ideas that really helped guide me in a more realistic direction amp x200b i ll definitely be here to offer my help for people asking related questions  and will also likely be asking other questions for other areas i didn t get to explore when i visit again  see you again in the future nihon ,1

trip report   june 2019 golden route,hello  i m currently too excited planning for our trip for next year  and it also has me looking back on our last trip in order to see what we would do different this time  i love reading trip reports so i thought it might be fun to relive my trip a little and do one myself  this was my first time ever leaving the city i grew up in so it was very exciting day 0  boarded my first ever plane ride from toronto with a layover in calgary  and then a 10 hour flight to narita  my boyfriend has been on plenty of plane rides before so let me take the  window seat  we arrived in the mid afternoon and immediately went to pick up our pocket wi fi  this was a life saver  and 14 day jr passes  took the skyliner as our passes weren t activated until the next day  and ended up walking from asakusa station to our hotel in asakusabashi because we weren t sure how the train system worked  this was a little inconvenient with our suitcases but was also a surreal moment to be walking through the streets i ve dreamed of for 10  years  we were super jet lagged so we checked into the hotel and got a quick  bite  at this  ramen place  across the street  the rest of the evening was spent exploring conbinis for  pudding  and beer day 1  our first full day in tokyo  and it started at 5am  we ended up waking up super early so grabbed some  coffee  and wandered the streets around our hotel  came across a quaint  small shrine  in between the variety of shops before taking the train to akihabara  i m a huge anime nerd and couldn t delay heading here  unfortunately we got there so early that the  streets  were practically  empty  and everything was closed  decided to try our first vending machine  restaurant  while waiting for the stores to open  after some time spent figure hunting and eating  magikarp taiyaki  we headed to ikebukoro for sunshine city  we came here for the pokemon centre but it was packed  explored ikebukoro streets for a bit and still super jet lagged dragged ourselves back to our hotel area to wander and  eat  a lot of  conbini food day 2  disappointed in our pokemon centre trip the day before  we headed back over to sunshine city to get a  proper look around  at it and a few other shops  we decided to catch lunch in the upstairs food part of the mall  which was under a lot of construction  but managed to find a cute little  shop  serving tempura and  soba  belly s full  it was time to head to  shinjuku  this was our first experience with the  rainy season  and quickly grabbed some cheap umbrellas before heading to the  samurai museum  we didn t realize how small the place was  but the guide makes it a super  fun  and  informative  experience  the best part was the samurai  battle  at the end of the tour  with the rain stilling down heavy  we took the short train ride to harajuku to visit  takeshita dori street  i assumed because of the rain there wouldn t be many people  but no one seems to mind and it was still plenty packed  spent a lot of time ducking in and out of cute shops and daiso  before grabbing the famous  crepes  i still have dreams about these things  feet plenty sore it was time to retire back to the hotel and try all of our daiso snacks day 3  up early again  still not adjusted we took a short train ride to the nearby  sensoji temple  in typical fashion we arrived  too early  and most  shops  were still in the midst of  opening up  we walked the length of the  temple  and by the time we turned around toe back it was apletely  different place  picked up a super cute  bento box  yukata  and wall scroll here  albeit for a lot of money  the  garden area  to the left of the main temple was a  nice surprise  from here it was time to head to  shibuya  as we wanted to check out the  crosswalk  and  hachiko  during the day  we had plans toe back here but left quickly to head towards  meiji shrine  the  area  you walk through to get to the shine was one of my favourite places in tokyo   so green and surprisingly quiet  stopped for some more  ramen at ippudo  which at the time were unaware it was a pretty popular chain restaurant  we were determined to stay awake into the night  so hopped on the train to  nakano broadway  we got lost navigating through this  mall  but did find a lot of reasonably priced statues  as well as some crazy  expensive old toys  super hungry we looked up some ayce places  and found a nice looking restaurant in akihabara called onyasai  it was a little difficult to find but certainly  ended up being worth it day 4  odaiba day  we left the hotel pretty early again  but with a specific destination in mind this time  which was to make it to  teamlabs borderless  before it opened  we arrived at about 8 50am and only waited in line for about 5 minutes before they began letting people in  i went into this place not knowing much  except to find the  lantern room  first  which i am so glad we did  because we walked right in  but when we returned later we realized it would be over an hour wait to get back in  most of the other exhibits were pretty empty  and we spent a good 3 hours or so here before ending in the  tea room  i definitely rending early  as it was packed by the time we were leaving  was by far my favourite thing we did in tokyo  i m super sad planets will be closed by the time we return next year  we  roamed  around the island a bit  found the  fuji tv  building  the  toyota mega web  venus fort  and then hunted down the giant  gundam  and  shonen jump  shop  i m super sad we didn t stay to see the gundam lit up  but the  views  from the shore of the  rainbow bridge  and weird  mascot  skit  ended  the trip here perfectly  went back to our hotel area and found a little hidden  udon  shop in the basement of another shop  saw a rendation to check out  sensoji at night  and was not  disappointed  there was basically no one  around  and everything  lit up  was a very cool experience day 5  finally time to leave tokyo  we caught an early shinkansen to kyoto  but not without grabbing  bentos  for the trip  our hotel was only a short walk to a lot of places we wanted to check out  so quickly dropped our bags and headed to  nishiki market  it was super nice to walk through and try the variety of  foods  and  snacks  though a little expensive  continuing on our journey we walked the  main strip  towards  gion  but stopped to enjoy the  river views  for a while  walking the empty  back alleys  of gion was very peaceful  the main strip was pretty hectic with lots of cars flying through  found a  temple  we never managed to find the name of just off the path of gion  had a  nice sunset  walking back towards our hotel area  and a good laugh at this  little shop day 6  one of the most disappointing and most wonderful parts of the trip   arashiyama  we got up very early to head here  probably about 6am  i wish we had of rented bikes  but we  roamed  for at least an hour and a half before  finally  checking out the grove  we got lost at one point but a nice local gave us a tiny map with directions on how to get back  the  grove  was by far the most underwhelming part of the trip  it  wasn t crowded  at all  got some  nice shots  with us alone in the grove  but it was  so short  based on the fact it is regarded as one of the must sees in this area  i would not rend this place to anyone  the walk up can be quite  peaceful and beautiful  but the famous grove spot itself is severely disappointing  we quickly left the grove to head for the opening time of the  monkey park  which turned out to be one of the  best parts  of kyoto  i can t express how lovely this experience was  from the  nice hike up  to the gorgeous  views of the city  and of course the  monkeys  i was sad to start the climb back down  but the rainy season was catching up to us in kyoto  we took shelter in a restaurant with a  nice view  over the main street  had some  lunch  and then left to check out the  kimono forest  again   very small  but a neat idea nonetheless  i wish we had of went to see a few temples  so will most definitely return to this area in the future  we didn t have anything planned for the evening  so took a quick break on the shinkansen and headed to  dotonbori  in osaka  this place was  packed  but such a  fun and lively  environment  tried a lot of  good food  found my  favourite dessert  forever in japan  then had some  delicious gyoza  and beer to end the night day 7  as came to be the norm  up super early to get some of those fluffy and beautiful  pancakes  at happy pancake  tempted to order more but decided against it  we took a bus to kiyomizudera  i think we got off at the  wrong stop  and ended up in a very large graveyard where we then entered the temple from the back  it was  under construction  at the time  but the views were still nice  after  soaking in the area  and checking out some shops  we hopped on another bus to the ginkakuji area  we initially came here to find a  mom and pop shop  that apparently serves great omurice  but it was unfortunately closed when we arrived  settled on trying an  italian place  in the area  decided to walk along the  philosopher s path  before being met with the worst thunderstorm we experienced the whole trip  we hid under a  roof overhang  for a while before giving up and running for the bus stop  we accidentally got on the bus going the wrong way and still don t know where we  ended up  but it was a nice walk back to the nearest station day 8  the thing i was most excited for in our whole trip was doing the  fushimi inari  so sure enough i dragged us out of bed at 6am to be there for 7am  i saw this place when i was younger and i thought it was so beautiful and interesting  and it lived up to my  expectations and more  it was  pretty empty  the  whole way up  except for a few locals who seemed to enjoy walking their pets along the  trail  a super  peaceful hike  with some unexpectedly  nice views  i m a sucker for a good hike with views  wandered off the  beaten path  a few times  where we didn t encounter  anyone else  we made it all the way to the  top  where i purchased an overly expensive but worth it mini torii gate  back at the bottom  got some  chicken  i still drool over thinking about  as per usual for most people  we headed towards  nara  next  the walk up to the  park  is nice in itself  and a  peaceful start  before the  deer  start harassing you  its funny how they bow to you  but kind of scary when a group of them are chasing you down trying to eat anything you have  we didn t actually pay to go in many  temples  but they were beautiful from the outside regardless  this was certainly my favourite day in kyoto day 9  we didn t actually plan to go to  himeji  but again ended up being one of our  favourite days  of the whole trip  the castle was under a  bit of construction  but it didn t take way from the  atmosphere  walking down the streets felt similar to walking downtown toronto  until you get a glimpse of the  castle in the distance  we spent  a lot of time  walking  around here  the  garden  attached to the castle was also a  huge surprise  we got in an hour or so before closing so there weren t many visitors  and it was such a  beautiful place  highly rend doing both if you go to see the castle  very traditional and peaceful  hungry as heck we spotted a coco ichibanya in the distance  and for a chain restaurant this was some  good curry  the  katsu  was so perfectly crispy  we caught the train back to the area of our hotel and decided to keep up with the habit of visiting chain restaurants  made our way to the closest  ichiran  we only waited about 20 minutes before being seated  and although a little salty it was still as  good as people say day 10  woke up to grab  bentos  and catch an early train to hiroshima  where we ditched our luggage and immediately made our way to  miyajima  spent a while just  roaming around  the island before heading up to the  rope way  we were a bit  pressed for time  to make it to the  top of the mountain  and back for the last ride  but decided to push it and do the  hike anyways  absolutely exhausted at the top  we took a much needed break to enjoy the  breathtaking views  and to agree it was worth it  the disappointing thing was that it was  low tide  and the torii was  under construction  we didnt get to see the floating temple gate  but still a  nice sunset  regardless  we ended up  wandering around hiroshima  streets for the rest of the evening  and have to give an honorable mention to these  spicy nuggets  i wish were in north america day 11  after sleeping in for once  we woke up and caught the sightseeing bus to  peace park  we  slowly  made our way through the  whole park  before deciding to enter the  peace memorial museum  didn t take many pictures this day  as it even felt a little weird to be taking them  inside the park  was an eye opening experience  and really glad we did it  spent the rest of the time  wandering  the  streets  i  really enjoyed  hiroshima as it was still a city  but felt much more peaceful than tokyo for obvious reasons  it was a nice mix day 12  took our time catching a shinkansen all the way back to tokyo  took plenty of snacks and  food  for the road  but ended up sleeping most of the way anyways  this day was reserved for any last minute  shopping  we intended to do  so besides for a few meals in between  we spent most of the time in don quijote  loft  tokyu hands and figurine shops in akihabara  also had the  cutest crepe day 13  we didn t spend a lot of money or time on fancy restaurants and food specifically because of the extravagance of our last night in japan  we booked a night with dinner and breakfast at konansou in  lake kawaguchiko  we originally booked a mountain view with  private onsen  room  but due to construction they  upgraded  us to the even  better suite  the room had  western beds  but we opted for the  japanese style futons  i still don t have the words to describe  this place  and even when i look at my own pictures its hard to  believe i was there  when we were being  served dinner  the host explained to us fuji hadn te out in over a month  and it just so happened the day we showed up it decided to  peak out  for a few hours  the  food  was  incredible  even though most of the time i was a little unsure what i was eating   walking  around the lake and  the town  was super peacefulpared to the busy cities we had spent the last two weeks in  everything about this ryokan was  perfect  the view from our room was amazing  and the  rooftop  foot  bath  was a neat little  bonus  i m so glad we splurged on this once in a lifetime thing  i woke up very early to enjoy the private onsen and to catch another glimpse of the  mountain  it was the perfect end to our trip ,1

hakone tozan train resuming service on 7 23,hakone has had a rough couple of years with various natural disasters or near disasters really hindering the transportation services in the area  i ve made previous threads about the disruptions of travel mostly stemming from typhoon hagibis  19  volcanic activity  and replacement of the cable cars  below is the final update as the entire circuit will be reopening in full  i included a backstory in case you forgot what was closed and why but everything should be good to go very soon as of posting this post japan still has closed borders with most countries in the world but i know many of you are still stalking this subreddit and planning your future trips so hopefully this information will be useful to those planning their trips now or will find it in the future   the hakone ropeway is currently open and clear of volcanic activity alerts that lasted from may 2019 until november 2019  it was closed for a few months earlier on in the year due to covid but they have since implemented safety measures and resumed operations  this may change in the future  volcanic activity may occur in the future and the ropeway does go down periodically due to volcanic gasses  different than volcanic activity  you can treat these closures much like poor weather as they can go down and resume normal operations within the same day and this usually does not lead to extended closures   the hakone cablecar is currently open after replacing the older models with new ones  before typhoon hagibis struck japan in october 2019 the replacement of the cablecars had already been put on the schedule  after the typhoon hit there was minor damage that needed to be repaired so the cablecar was closed temporarily before resuming operations  eventually the cablecar was closed from december 2019 until spring 2020  the new cars are running ready for you to enjoy  i just wanted to clarify the extended downtime was not due to the typhoon but for already scheduled improvements the hakone tozan train  when typhoon hagibis hit japan in october 2019 huge landslides took out portions of the track  service was able to be resumed from odawara to hakone yumoto but from hakone yumoto to gora you had to take alternate buses to your destination   starting july 23  2020 the entire line will be operational again from odawara to gora station   japanese pdf of the announcement with all of that this means that the ropeway  cablecar  and full train line will be operational all at once making the  golden loop route  possible again which has not been possible for a very long time due to various occurrences  hopefully they remain in operation until the borders re open to a majority of ya ll  good luck ,1

m a terrible driver day 1  arrive at haneda at 5 pm  take keikyu airport line  transfer to asakusa line at keisei narita  get off at higashi nihombashi and arrive at my aodations in ginza  i ll probably grab something at a conbini for dinner  as i imagine i ll get to ginza around 8 based off how long customs and such will take  question  would i be able to walk around ginza do any touristy

azabujuuban to meet my friend for the sailor moon dinner theater show  and then metro back to ginza around 9 pm  day 3  wake up at 9  grab breakfast  and depart from kodemmacho station to akihabara station  i am meeting up with a tour group to do a 3 hour tour of akihabara  fwiw i actually love tour groups  after the tour is over  i m meeting another pal at the akiba owl cafe  as she s a big fan  our plan was to then pick up lunch at a conbini  and from akihabara station transfer lines and get off at kojimachi station  walk to chidorigafuchi park and have hanami  our plan from there was to walk to kojimachi station  take the yurakucho line  to yurakucho station and see a mangekyo show  then walk to a nearby bar  have a drink and head back home  day 4  i m taking a brief detour to nara and kyoto  my plan was to check out of my aodation around 8  take nozomi shinkansen to nara and arrive in nara around 1 pm  i was planning on dropping my luggage off at the ryokan i m staying at  grab lunch and explore nara park  toda ji and daibutsuden  walk back to my ryokan  grab dinner and hit the onsen  i mainly wanted to see nara and relax in a more traditional setting  day 5  i m departing from nara at 8 am  taking the nara line to kyoto station and dropping my bags off at my aodation  i expect to make it there by 10   10 30 am  after that  my day is pretty empty  i m open for suggestions  i am staying near shinkyogoku  and i will be visiting the samurai experience  but other than that i have a lot of time on my hands  day 6  i agreed to take an 8 hour tour of kyoto unesco heritage sites with a friend  we ll be seeing pretty much everything i wanted to see in kyoto  that s going to take up most of my day  day 7  i return to tokyo  i m planning on taking the nozomi shinkansen back to tokyo  and leaving around 8 am  which should put me in shibuya around 12  which is where i ll be based for the rest of my trip  my plan for today was to take to visit the odaiba oedo onsen monogatari for a good portion of the day  and around 6 or 7  explore odaiba and take the palette town ferris wheel  open for suggestions about what else to do  where to eat day 8  my big shibuya day  would love rendations on where to grab a bite for breakfast  as i m staying about a 10 min walk from center gai  my plan was to go shopping  see hachiko and meiji jinju  do more shopping  get lunch  visit the hedgehog cafe in harajuku and then take the chuo line to nakano station to do more shopping at nakano broadway  question  does anyone have rendations for an english speaking nail salon to get nail art done  i m thinking about getting that and eyelash extensions done while i m staying in shibuya  i was going to head back to shibuya and get sushi at genki sushi when i m done at nakano broadwayday 9  my big harajuku day  would love breakfast and lunch rendations  i m going to be checking out the stores on takeshita street  and hitting up kiddy land and laforet  i m also going to the minipig cafe  this is mainly a shopping rest day  so if you know any good spots to chill and people watch  let me know  i was planning on going to ichiran for dinner and then i guess hitting up an izakaya for drinks  day 10  meeting up with another friend and her daughter and doing sanriopuro and kawaii monster  she lives here so i m letting her take the ropes on today  day 11  i m planning

seeking ideas for what to do with the rest of my day  thanks for reading all of this  to summarize  i have a pretty defined idea of what i d like to do and see  and i have aodations booked  i d like

north to south  or vice versa  route from matsuyama to kochi in shikoku ,is there no direct north to south land route from matsuyama to kochi  the idea is that i do something outside of the usual central japan tourist route    fly in via fukuoka  then do a loop   fukuoka  gt  hiroshima  gt  shimanami kaido from onomichi to imabari or ferry directly to matsuyama  gt  kochi  gt     gt  fly out of fukuoka    or do an open jaw flight   fly in via kix  then onomichi  gt  shimanami kaido  gt  imabari or matsuyama  gt  kochi  gt     gt  fly out of fukuoka  hyperdia and google maps are both failing me  or i m not entering the right stations in hyperdia  it s also possible that there s really no convenient way of doing this route e g  i have to backtrack somewhere to get to fukuoka within a reasonable amount of time  e g  3hrs on a train or something  and or cost  i e  not flying out from kochi to fukuoka via llc thanks ,1
japan  tokyo sapporo yokohama  february 2020 trip report  tomatoes  pudding   jiro s  sushi  and everything else,before i begin  this is going to be a very lengthy post  if you d rather just look at the photos with minimalentary   here you go  i m writing this now because of how much i miss my trip  i went on a trip with my girlfriend a little over four months ago  we d both been to tokyo before so we wanted to explore other parts of the country  we settled on sapporo because of the experience japan fares available to us from ana and jal  and because of the uing snow festival  we both really wanted to go to a ryokan with a nice onsen too  so sapporo seemed like a good idea  we got sim cards from jr rail  it was affordable and always consistently good throughout our trip  highly rend instead of lugging around a pocket wifi  we had a few major goals 1  we re both avid foodies  and particularly into sushi  so we decided to hit up multiple sushi places at different price points  including sushisai wakichi in sapporo  as well as jiro honten and takamitsu  we supplemented this with fish markets in otaru  standing sushi bars  izakaya  and even some supermarket sushi  all were delicious  2  apparently the best pizza in the world might be in japan  to that end we tried sisilya in yokohama  3  like i said  it was important to see parts of the country other than tokyo  4  to take some time to just let ourselves explore the city instead of planning literally every step of the way  this was great  it let us have a more relaxed schedule  and overall we found some pretty interesting places just by wandering around day 1 we landed in haneda after a brief detour to narita  routing issues  later in the evening   so after dropping off our big luggages at the luggage storage in the airport  we just grabbed some food at the airport  and stayed at a nearby hotel called henn na  it was a fucking weird hotel in many ways  have you ever been greeted by a t rex concierge  but it did the job and the sheer novelty factor was pretty funny  found a convenience store and had pudding  pudding is super important  we had at least one pudding a day every day we were in japan  they re delicious and simply so many varieties    and i highly rend getting one   just look at this  we got to otaru and since we had some extra time  we bussed all the way to nikka yoichi  there s a  beautiful tasting bar  and a lot of wonderful history  and of course  the store at the end is really nice too if you re into whiskey  after getting back to otaru station there was some time to check out sankaku fish market  i could say a lot  but just have  this picture  fortunately  even though it was slippery outside  there was a shuttle car that took us directly to kuramure ryokan  it was a truly wonderful and zen place  even including a  zen room  the moment we got out of the car  we were treated like royalty  we were givenplimentary snacks while they prepared our room  the onsen concept was great too with both interior and exterior hot springs where you could feel the cool wintery air contrasting with the heat emanating from the water  it was really relaxing to watch the snow slowly falling while relaxing in thefortable warmth of the onsen  of course  meals were included  but booze was also freeflowing as part of the kuramure experience  it was definitely a leisurely and relaxing experience  one that i ll never forget  the hospitality  atmosphere  and sheer relaxation i felt was a first for me   day 3 after breakfast and another soak in the kuramure onsen  we took the train directly back to sapporo  we stayed at gracery sapporo since it was basically right outside sapporo station  but the hotel was a little small  though the staff were very nice  when we bought too many souvenirs  since we didn t have our big luggages  they helped us ship everything back to tokyo at our next hotel  from there  we hit up cheese market and also had soup curry for the first time at garaku  it had a good kick to it and felt less rich than the usual thick curries  even 4 months later  i still remember that the potato was particularly delicious  we walked by the snow fest and decided we d go back tomorrow  for dinner we decided to go to sushisai wakichi  which was booked 2 months in advance  it was a 1  michelin place with a focus on ingredients from hokkaido  in particular   the surf clam  was incredibly good  this was a good start to our sushi adventure   day 4 this day was all about going to the snow festival  from  incredible multi storey snow sculptures  to downright  strange characters  this festival had a lot to take in  the food selection was crazy too  there were food stalls all along the several blocks of displays  off the top of my head  i remember an incredible uni risotto for 800 yen along  buttery sweet corn  shirako tempura  and a stand that served hot cocktails  perfect for the cold  hearing about how awesome the crab in hokkaido was  we ended up getting a reservation at kani honke  when we got in we were a little worried it was just a tourist trap  but ultimately  even though it did seem to cater to foreigners  there was this huge group of tourists waiting to get seated when we got in  the food was still pretty good and we got a nice private room to eat slowly  my girlfriend is into jazz  so we ended up going to slow boat in sapporo  it was a cozy bar with swanky live jazz  we met a lot of locals here who were really friendly  we all tried to talk to each other in broken japanese and english  lots of drinks were had and we all had a great time   day 5 it was back to tokyo in the late morning  but we prepared with a highly rended  breakfast of champions  these were fancier department store puddings which were great too  but in balance i prefer the kombini pudding  at the airport  we found a nice standup sushi bar with an ipad multi language menu where you just ordered a la carte and it was served to you piece by piece  we landed in tokyo at around 1 and picked up our luggages before heading to our first hotel in shinjuku  we really wanted to hit up this place called ben fiddich  i ve been once before after seeing  this strangely sensual set of videos  since it has some of the most amazing cocktails  there s no menu  you just go in and tell him what flavour profiles you want  what spirits you re into or aren t into  etc  i don t want to spoil to much  but if you re into cocktails you ll have a good time  i rend lining up before it opens so you can snag seats at the bar and watch the man himself in action  and yes  his stare is that sensual irl  as we randomly walked around we found this swanky little basement yakitori place simply called  toriya  it seemed like mostly locals  but one of the waitresses there sat us down and basically google translated with us so we could order the set menu  the  yakitori here  was nicer than what i had at toriki in asakusa  and i didn t have to book well in advance   day 6 i ve never had the famous uni charcoal bun at tsukiji outer  so we went to the market and had some strawberries  coffee  an uni bun  and sat down at one of the many sushi bars still in the area to have a quick meal before going over to teamlab planets  last time i visited japan i d visited borderless already  and i felt like that was more of a sensory overload  sheer scale of it all kind of experience with multiple floors and freedom to move as you pleased to fashion your own experience  in contrast  planets was smaller  but far more focused and interactive  you were guided along one set path with many surprises  ultimately  i actually preferred  this guided approach  it felt more cohesive and better thought out  but i also feel like i appreciated it more because i d been to borderless first  both are great  but for anyone reading this later i don t think you need to do both  just choose one or the other and you ll have a good time  as big fans of gundam  we made our way over to gundam base after in odaiba  their merch store is awesome  some of the coolest clothing and accessories i ve ever seen for anime merch  in the evening  we went over to omoide yokocho and discovered horaiya  remember  izakaya often charge a sitting fee  but provide a small appetizer  so don t be surprised at a small random charge at the end on the bill for that  here we discovered  tomato sours  i implore you if you re into booze and tomatoes try this  so incredibly refreshing  it s not like a bloody mary or a caesar  it s got more effervescence to it and the flavours of the tomato are brighter sweeter than those other cocktails  no pics unfortunately  but we also found ourselves at this small basement bar called midori  basic cocktails and nice vibe with a darn good yakisoba day 7 before going to nakajima  a 1  michelin restaurant that serves iwashi based dishes starting at 880yen all in during lunch  we walked around shinjuku a bit and found ourselves in the beautiful hanazono jinja  for nakajima  you really need to line up at least half an hour before they open for lunch  both times i ve been  rain or shine  by the time they re about to open the line runs up past the stairway  the standout at nakajima for me is the  sashimi lunch set  and you can simply add a half order of fried iwashi if you want a big lunch  after lunch  we took the train to asakusa to eat some street food around sensoji  we ended up finding all sorts of delights  ranging from ebi katsu sando and curry pan to  pizza from a food truck  that had an actual pizza oven inside of it  other redditors have rended fruit parlor goto  and i have to say i agree  we had to wait for about 20 minutes to get in  but the wonderfully aromatic and sweet fresh fruit was an awesome showcase of ingredients without paying an arm and a leg for premium japanese fruit  at dinner time  we hit up l effervescence  i ll just say that if you re into fine dining but not quite so  uptight  l eff has an amazing vibe  classic rock plays lightly in the background  while elegantly dressed waitstaff know how to crack a joke or two while providing a stellar dining experience  having been to places like per se in new york  the experience at l eff simply blew it out of the water  there was an air of friendliness and passion in the food  which of course was  delicious  exciting  and at times even surprising   day 8 we needed to relax during day 8  we were drinking highballs and or tomato sours   eating pudding every day  staying out late every night  walking everywhere  so we had a chill day in akihabara  mostly arcade gaming looking for merch  and shinjuku  henry burger is pretty good if you want wagyu burgers  it s by nakahara  who runs sumibu yakinuku nakahara  a famous and delicious yakinuku place  more on that later  in the evening we went to isomaru suisan  a seafood focused izakaya chain  i m a fan of isomaru suisan because it s 24 hours  and i found out that they have good tomato sours too  seriously  get one  if you re a murakami fan  the most interesting thing we did on this day was head to jazz bar dug  featured in norweigian wood iirc  we mainly went because of the murakami nod  but it ended up being nice and chill  exactly what we were looking for for a relaxing evening  again  the tomato sour was quite delicious  it d be a good place to take a date day 9 today was ghibli museum day  it had a nice historic feel to it and we got to watch a short film in the theatre area  if i m being honest this didn t seem amazing for how much work was done to get those tickets  but that general area of town is pretty cool  it s also where satou meat cutlet is  and they serve some of the juiciest menchikatsu  i d actually have gone to this part of town for satou alone  but we also accidentally ran into this  crazy two storey cat cafeplex  while we were walking around  one of the things i love about japan is all the weird and interesting shit you encounter if you take some time to just walk around  wanting to deepen our understanding of tea  we also booked sakurai souen  which is essentially a sort of  tea omakase  where they serve you different types of tea paired with wagashi or other little food pairings  tbh  this was a bit lost on me  i enjoyed the tea  but i don t have enough knowledge about tea to really pick out all the nuances   day 10 refreshed and recharged from two relaxing days  we decided to day trip yokohama bright and early  the food stands in chinatown weren t even open when we got there  it s a bit more than 30 minutes from shinjuku station red line  so we explored a few of the chinese inspired temples first  by the time we got back  we were able to get some  peking duck wraps  for 250yen  we walked to the harborfront area where there was randomly a strawberry festival going on  and after that on a whim went to the instant ramen museum  i was surprised by how aesthetic it was  the stairway is pretty impressive  and it was a surprisingly inspiring exhibition  i didn t realize the work that was put into it  nor how important instant ramen really was  cost of admission was quite cheap and definitely worth a visit  there was still some time before our main goal for yokohama  and since we love onsen we decided to go to manyo club for a quick dip  it had a series of indoor and outdoor hot springs and was great for a nice pick me up since we d done a lot of walking during the day  it was time for the main event for yokohama   sisilya  apparently it s one of the best pizza places in japan  we showed up without a reservation and i think they took pity on us because they squeezed us in  we were super thankful and ordered wine  two pizzas and apps  both the quattro formaggi and the  margherita  were out of this world  i live in north america  and i ve never even had a pizza thates close anywhere i ve eaten at  i m planning to eat my way through all the best pizza places in japan because of sisilya   day 11 this was a relatively chill day  we explored ikebukoro  and found this really interesting vr gaming centre called mazaria  we got to suit up and play dragon quest  you had to actually walk around in real life and the vr arena that was used for the experience was around as big as a small gymnasium  i want to quickly mention saitamaya  which is also  featured in this video  by simon  amp  martina  my girlfriend went the last time she was in japan  and said it was a must visit  we got there nearly an hour early  and the people inside noticed and kindly brought us chairs  by the time they opened  there were over 20 people in the line  the experience was hilarious   it felt like my grandpa was cooking for me  except if my grandpa cooked extremely delicious yakitori while flirting with my girlfriend  me  and everyone else in the room  expect to drink while you re here  their lemon sours are extra boozy and it s simply part of the experience  it s a great time where everyone s having fun  i would definitely go back every time i m in japan if i could  if i lived in japan  i d probably go at least a couple times a month day 12 we had a few nights left in tokyo  and this is where the food craziness began  i m only going to talk about the food because that is basically  all we did  for lunch  we hit up tempura kondo  we got one of the set menus and got to experience tempura that waspletely unlike what we normally get back here at home  how can something be deep fried  yet not be oily  it was surprisingly refreshing and not crazy rich  we ate a lot of tempura  and surprisingly  the highlights were the vegetables  in particular  the  asparagus  was ridiculously juicy  like exploding in my mouth with juices akin to a potsticker levels of juiciness  our concierge told us to get the carrot tempura  which was an excellent choice  if i go again  i ll have to try the whole sweet potato tempura as well  apparently  the chef wants the vegetables to take on more of a starring role which is why the produce used is so excellent  before dinner we explored tokyo station for a while  it s this labyrinth of a mall where it s really easy to get lost but wherever you go there s food  shopping  or department stores  for dinner  we went to sumibu yakiniku nakahara  they re known for incredibly high quality beef  in particular their  beef tongue  is of extremely high quality  the food itself was delicious  and sort of like lunch  i was surprised by how rich the meat was yet how much of it i could eat  i think part of the trick is that they never give you a lot of any of the fattier meats  and there are little palate cleansers that help you reset  the server made the experience more fun too   he seemed to genuinely love what he was doing as he excitedly explained the ingredients and cooked the different parts for us with his deft hands  if you go  please don t neglect to order the beef katsu sando   day 13 since 2013 when i watched jiro dreams of sushi  i ve always wanted to go to jiro honten  apparently he s the person who popularized the akami gt chutoro gt o toro progression of nigiri sushi in omakase  i finally had my chance after many years of waiting to go for lunch  unfortunately  jiro himself wasn t there and i was served by his son  nevertheless  we had a great  if quick  experience at the restaurant  i thanked them profusely in my broken japanese and ended up taking some photos with them  i will say that it wasn t the best sushi i ve ever had  and the cost was pretty high especially for the speed of the progression  but i treated it like more of an experience than just a meal  something someone who s a huge nerd about sushi and omakase ought to try at least once  and i do think i d only do this once  for dinner  we hit up a pork katsu specialist restaurant called  butagumi  they serve pork from several different producers around japan and beyond  for example  iberico in spain  the golden boar pork  yes  that s what the menu said  was very delicious if you re into super fatty meat   day 14 unfortunately  there wasn t enough time to go to tomita honten  fortunately  tomita has a branch around tokyo station  i thought i ve eaten tsukemen before  but  eating at tomita  made me realize how little i understand about the world of tsukemen  the noodles are thick with the right amount of chew  and the broth is simply intense plex and flavourful  only noodles like tomita s can stand up to it  we lined up over half an hour before it opened and there was already someone waiting before us  you order with a touch screen so you can just change the language to english as needed  for our last meal together  long story short  we ended up with different flights on the way home  we wanted to go out with a bang and ended up at an establishment called takamitsu  it s a 1  michelin sushi omakase restaurant with pretty much  all the frills  you can think of  there s a definite element of  showmanship  here but it sbined with an incredible amount of skill  we got course after course of delicious sushi or appetizers  the head chef was good natured and humorous  and in fact we laughed together several times  this would be closer to sho style sushi for those who are wondering  it s meals like this that make you realize how all the elements of a fine dining experiencee together to create something unforgettable   of course the food was truly amazing  but the chef genuinely having a good time with you while putting on a show really does take things to the next level for our final evening in japan  we decided to walk through the imperial gardens  there was a real feeling of tranquility walking  through the space  the  traditional buildings juxtaposed with the city lights on the outside  with pretty much no one else around except for the occasional runner gave off the feel that we were in our own little world exploring a place disconnected from other parts of time   day 15 did you think i d end without showing you my last meal   breakfast of champions  round 2 ,1
90 itinerary,i apologize in advance for being too wordy here  my previous post was removed as it only had my itinerary so i m filling in all of the blanks here  90 days is an awfully long time so i ll try to be as brief as possible while still fulfilling the rules of this amazing subreddit  i have been to japan before  but that was  12 years ago so perhaps much has changed  back then  i had spent roughly 8 days in tokyo and 4 in kyoto  it left such a lasting impression on me  that i ve decided to return and soak up more of it s culture  i realize that there is a lot to see and experience  but there s so very little time  i generally enjoy traveling slow  but i m attempting topromise a bit on this trip to see as much as possible without feeling too rushed  with that being said  i ve attempted to throw in a good mix of relaxation and exploration  and making sure to separate weeks with a lot of traveling far apart  i ll be taking advantage of   services so that my suitcase will never be a burden  i ll also carry with me a backpack large enough to carry clothes good for a few days while i m without my luggage i suppose that providing a little bit of detail about me might help you all with rendations and such  so here it goes  solo  introverted traveler in my 30s  i love nature but can also appreciate modern conveniences as well as advanced technology  i very much appreciate temples especially after having researched the landmarks  history and significance  though i am a bit apprehensive of getting burnt out on them  i d like to experience what it s like living in a modern city  thus the long stays in tokyo and osaka  i d like to be a regular at a convenience shop or maybe even a coffee house  though i don t understand why so many open so late  i used to enjoy walking around late at night where i m from here in san francisco  but with the rise in violence  homelessness  etc  it s something i haven t done in a while so i m very much looking forward to experience the night activites anywhere possible   live music venues  izakayas  random exploring through quiet neighborhoods  my favorite part of the day are the moments right before and after sunset because i like the way things appear as they bathe in softer  this word appropriate  light  if ever i feel overwhelmed  or things are moving too fast and my energy is being depleted  i plan to simply find a peaceful place to read my books like going to a park  for this reason  i ve also spaced out many onsen opportunities  do i have too many obviously i m missing many interesting places of interest  i d like to know if there are places i should omit add  extend shorten  i wee any and all rendations critiques and i promise to keep an open mind  if there are lesser known regional cuisines that are  must haves  i d like to hear them  my budget for food is 100 dollars a day  i m sure that s enough to experience a handful of michelin star restaurants  bib gourmand michelin rended  snacks at the conbinis and everything in between  i absolutely love ramen  so i ll be having a ton of inexpensive meals to offset the costs of the pricier restaurants   amp x200b october 7   12  sapporo with side trips to otaru  ookeikyo onsen  and possibly lake toya  starting my trip off in hokkaido  since i won t be renting a car and relying solely on public transportation  most of hokkaido will be out of reach for me  so i know it s a shame  but still  i wanted to experience dining on the seafood that the region is known for as well as munching on regional specialties like jinghis khan and their style of ramen  otaru looks like a quaint little town that would be worth exploring  in this leg of the trip  i get to experience my first onsen experience  i ll also be riding a horse for my first time hopefully october 13  hakodate  i ll be passing through here  so i may as well stop by to pick up a kaisendon right   october 14 15  aomori  main highlight here for me will probably be oirase stream gorge october 16 18  nikko  most itineraries i ve seen are either 1 2 days here  so i wonder if i m spending too much time  i ve no interest in edo wonderland as it looks a bit touristy trappy but would consider if still if people say it s worth it  senjogara and the surrounding nature areas look amazing  not sure if it s possible to walk there late at night because i ve actually never seen a sky full of twinkling stars due to light pollution  i m thinking this is my best bet on my trip here in japan october 19  kinugawa onsen  ryokan kaiseki meals onsen october 20   november 14  tokyo with side trips to yokohama  kamakura enoshima  kawagoe  mount takao  mitake  i ll be staying in shinjuku for the entirety of my stay in tokyo osaka november 15   december 1  osaka with side trips to nara  mount koya  kyoto  making my homebase in osaka to explore the kansei area  i will be dedicating a longer stay in kyoto in early mid december once the crowds die down a bit  but i can t help but want to visit while the autumn colors are at their peak december 2   4  hiroshima miyajima december 5   6  kurashiki  okayama  naoshima  still contemplating on whether naoshima will be something i enjoy  i can appreciate art  but it s not usually something i go out of the way for  kurashiki can be enjoyed for a handful of hours  so i figure i d stop by on my way to okayama   december 7  himeji kobe  himeji during the day afternoon  and then kobe at night  i m mostly just going to kobe to enjoy the night view of the city december 8   13  kyoto i d like to explore by bike as much as possible  separate days for exploring s  higashiyama gion  n higashiyama  northwestern area  a few flex days to explore less popular areas  i want to do arashiyama on the very last day here   hopefully they ll start their christmas illuminations december 14 15  kinosaki onsen  more onsen  looking forward to eating a ton of crab december 16 17  takayama shirakawago  the ride from kinosaki onsen to takayama is a long one  not sure if i will be spending enough time here   december 18 19  kawaguchiko  2 days in case i decide to visit fuji q december 20   january 4  currently the plan is to go back to tokyo  staying in ginza  but i m leaving it flexible in case there are areas i want to return to  or if i feel like exploring new areas  a friend of mine rended the izu peninsula  but aside from the ocean views  there doesn t seem to be much else through my own research ,1
march april 2021 sakura season itinerary advice needed based on our interests  timing and budget,obviously in full awareness of how covid 19 might spoil our plans again  we were going to travel to japan in march this year  we have drafted a new itinerary for march april next year  ideally to look for sakura season  we are a couple in our early 30s  used to travelling in europe and open to new experiences which is basically our main objective of visiting japan timing  sakura season  we would be more than happy to find some sakura starting to open  even better if they are in full bloom  but of course there is nothing we can do to anticipate that at this moment  for that reason we have reviewed previous years reports and are planning on the following route to max our chances of seeing sakura in full bloom our interests  we are basically interested in different aspects of japanese culture which would of course include food  curry  sushi  street food  konbini food   tendon  tempura also maybe trying some japanese tea and okashi  visiting temples  try to absorb some of the sakura excitement if we are lucky enough to coincide with the season somewhere  also having some unique experiences  such as doing part of the nakasendo or going to koyasan  our plan is indeed tobine larger cities such as osaka and tokyo which seem full of places of interest for us  very interested in visiting manga  anime  videogaming shops  anything pokemon dbz  as well as unique bookstores and stationery shops such as itoya and loft  we are also interested in more traditional japan  and that s why we thought of not only including kyoto which will probably be beyond crowded but also go to takayama  kanazawa  matsumoto and stay a night at miyajima  we are really interested in photography as well  mainly landscape but also traditional towns photography  i m also learning japanese  lower intermediate to intermediate  so will try tounicate in the language as much as possible budget  we are targeting a low to mid range budget i d say  mainly staying in guesthouses  business hotels  private rooms in hostels with the occasional splurge in a ryokan shukubo as you ll see below march 25th  we would be arriving at tokyo in the afternoon  this is a day we are planning to just relax  maybe talk a walk and eat something out at night near the area where we plan to stay  ueno asakusa  but basically to take it easy as jet lag is probably going to hit us hard  having to fly all the way from argentina march 26th to 28th  3 days  tokyo  we divided tokyo into two sections  in the beginning and at the end of the trip  to have some time to get used to the city after jet lag at first but also because it would be a good timing for sakura  and then at the end to also unwind a little bit before returning home and because we plan on going to fujisan at that time where sakura is supposed to be blooming usually  during these 3 days our plan is to stay in asakusa or ueno  and probably take the time to visit some of the areas that are closer  these days would include sightseeing through asakusa  ueno  akihabara  probably also in the area around tokyo station  ginza and maybe visit teamlab borderless museum in the odaiba area  depending on sakura status  imperial palace and chidorigafuchi are a possibility  day trip to nikko is a possibility if time allows there but not yet  fixed  in our itinerary as we don t really want to rush it too much march 29th 30th  2 days  early train to hiroshima  we might take the overnight train on the night before to maximize our time there  still to decide on that  our plan is to visit hiroshima in the morning noon  visiting peace park and museum  eating some okonomiyaki  and then go in the early afternoon to miyajima  which is the place we d like to visit the most in this region  rest of march 29th and march 30th until noon at least would be devoted to miyajima  where we are planning to stay the night to have some quiet away from the daily crowds  in here we d like to take it easy and take some walks  mainly around itsukushima shrine  on the second day  we would be visiting himeji castle for a couple of hours enroute to kyoto where we d just spend the night march 31st april 1 2  3 days  kyoto  we plan on staying in the gion higashiyama area  maybe as close as possible to kiyomizudera  we are mainly interested in visiting philosopher s path  gion district and higashiyama area  trying to do some very very early mornings in kiyomizudera gion to take some good pictures without heavy crowds  this we would also do in arashiyama bamboo grove and we are wondering whether to visit fushimi inari shrine in the very early morning or at sunset  apart from those  no particular interests at the moment but just to try to take it easy and not rush it a lot  main focus would be for sure in the arashiyama area but especially in higashiyama gion  we will probably also be visiting nara as a day trip during this period april 3rd  1 day  koyasan  we would be arriving at noon from kyoto  as we know it s kind of a long trip up there  the idea is to take some walks throughout the templates and stay the night at a shukubo near okunoin to be able to visit the cemetery at night and very early in the morning april 4th 5th  2d  osaka  we are really interested in visiting osaka as an alternative of a big city to tokyo as it seems to have an interesting side to it  and seems to be a city full of a fantastic food scene  even regarding  street food  which we are really interested in  sightseeing wise our main interest would be osaka castle and the dotonbori area  probably extending these to some of the parks in case sakura is in bloom in the area  april 6th 7th  2 days  kyoto  we would use this time to visit what we couldn t in kyoto during the first 3 days  please see description above  and maybe do a day trip to okayama if time allows  we would also like to do some night photography where crowds are a bit more reduced  mainly in the pontocho area  note  we are  sandwiching  osaka and koyasan between two stays in kyoto to avoid the weekend there and to maximize the chances of sakuras in full bloom in kyoto itself april 8th and 9th  2 days  kanazawa and day trip to shirakawa go  in kanazawa  our plan is to visit the old town  higashichaya  but also spend some hours in konrakouen  maybe kanazawa castle  as it seems to be a more extended larger citypared to takayama  we are devoting two days to do kanazawa   day trip to shirakawa go  going back to kanazawa  i know that it would be backtracking as we would visit takayama the next day but i understand kanazawa would have more to uspared to takayama april 10th  1 day  takayama  our plan is to stay near the station to be able to start our sightseeing as soon as arriving  probably as early in the morning as buses from kanazawa would allow  plan here is basically to visit the old town and pursue some good photography in the area  maybe try some hida takayama beef as well if we find a not super expensive option to try it  we are staying a night as we wanted to have some time away from the heavy crowds that ll probably be during the day april 11th  1 day  travel from takayama to magome  and start the nakasendo walking trail up to tsumago  main interested here is to do something  different  with some photography of traditional houses and enjoy the walk itself through the forest with mountains views  plan is to take as much of the day as needed for this  taking it easy  and stopping for breakfast lunch as needed  and then go to matsumoto to spend the night april 12th  1 day  matsumoto  the idea is also to take it easy as we would probably be very tired from the day before  both the walk and the transportation itself  our main objective here is to visit matsumoto castle which we found super beautiful and unique  both in daylight and during the night  if we happen to coincide with sakura blooming  we might visit some additional locations such as koboyama park april 13th  1 day  travel via nagano to jikogudani monkey park where we plan to spend some hours  probably eating some lunch in nagano and then travelling to tokyo in the afternoon early night to spend the night there april 14th to 16th  3 days  tokyo  plan here is to stay in shinjuku or shibuya area to concentrate our sightseeing on the western side of tokyo  the idea is to visit shinjuku and shin okubo at night as well as going to ghibli museum during one of the mornings  additionally  central shibuya  probably visiting don quixote  shibuya 109 and some of the larger stores  and some of the parks in the area as shinjuku gyoen yoyogi park and meiji shrine  in addition  a day trip to fujisan is a possibility here  and we would be monitoring the  clouding  very closely to make sure we have a chance of viewing the actual mountain when we go there april 17th  this day we would be leaving tokyo  depending on which flight we take this would mean either an early morning flight or having a full morning and some extra couple of hours and flying out at around 4 5 pm i would love to know how you feel about this itinerary and you would tweak it based on your thoughts on each place but also taking our interests and timing objectives  sakura season  into consideration  we are particularly interested in hearing about  how packed  you feel our itinerary is  and if it would represent a good overview of what japan has to offer in line with what we re looking for during this trip  we want to avoid running too much while at the same time visiting  any advice on changes places we can t miss in your opinion but weren t included in our draft itinerary or places you would take out for a specific reason  feel free to let us know  we d appreciate your help a lot ,1

march 2021 travel itinerary,my partner and i are planning a roughly 4 week trip to japan  provided covid 19 travel restrictions are lifted from canada by march 2021  although we have never been to japan before  i think it admissible to note that we are relatively experienced travellers who are accustomed to backpacking for several weeks at a time while staying in modest airbnbs  the occasional hostel even more occasional hotel splurges for 1 4 nights in any given city  for instance  we recently travelled thru vietnam  gt  laos  gt  thailand  gt  malaysia  gt  singapore over a period of 5 weeks and managed to superficially explore various regions in each country without feeling too rushed  in short  we re interested in packing a lot in while still being realistic about logistics  for our japan trip  i d like to gather some insight and feedback pertaining to my proposed itinerary  mainly regarding length of time spent in the hiroshima okayama matsuyama area and with regards to fukuoka and nagasaki being worth the visit within our time constraints  i should also note that we will be returning to tokyo after making use of a 14 day jr rail pass and will be flying rt to bangkok in order to visit my partner s father for a few days  after returning to tokyo from bangkok  we intend to spend 3 days exploring hakone and lake kawaguchi fujiyoshida for scenic views of mt  fuji with a potential pitstop in kamakura en route back to tokyo on day 3  the remaining 5 days of our time in japan will be spent in tokyo  if you have any pertinent rendations for this region that would also be appreciated without further ado day 1  flight from toronto lands around 4 00pm  gt  activate jr rail pass and board train directly to kanazawa  gt  arrive and check in to aodation by 8 00pmday 2  full day on foot in historic kanazawa exploring kenroku en  castle park  and whatever further research illuminates  hopefully the jet lag proves manageable day 3  rise early to finish time change acclimation  gt  explore a local morning market  gt  check out of aodation by mid afternoon  gt  leave kanazawa and board direct train to takayama  gt  potentially check in to a heavily tattooed couple friendly ryokanday 4  morning walk through takayama  gt  check out  gt  train to kyoto  gt  check in to aodation somewhere around nishiki market day 5  full day in kyoto spent temple hopping and snacking our way through the eastern side of the city and the gion districtday 6  full day in kyoto spent in the arashiyama area going to the bamboo forest and monkey park iwatayamaday 7  check out of kyoto  gt  1 hour train to okayama  gt  stay in okayama for the evening  or catch the shiokaze limited express to matsuyama  2 5 hours  and spend the evening around the famous dogo onsen alternatively we could depart kyoto and take the train directly to hiroshima day 8  if we make it to matsuyama  we would take the jr ferry across the water to hiroshima and spend the day exploring the city and taking the jr san yo line ferry to miyajima  evening spent in hiroshimaday 9  depart hiroshima for fukuoka  gt  check in  gt  devote most of our time to kitschy shopping malls and food tourism day 10  do we need this day in fukuoka  do we skip it entirely and head to the more cosmopolitan nagasaki  do we even bother with kyushu island  i m not sure if our time would be better spent around shikoku island  thereby providing more time in okayama and hiroshima  day 11  depart either kyushu prefecture or shikoku island for osaka mid morning  gt  check in to osaka aodation  gt  eat  walk  repeat  etc  day 12  full day in osakaday 13  jr train from osaka to ekoin buddhist temple and ryokan for mid afternoon check in  i believe this place is accessible from osaka and nara via jr train day 14  day trip to nara  gt  deposit backpacks in station lockers  gt  spend most of the afternoon around the deer park  gt  train directly back to tokyo for the evening in time for our jr passes to expire that s it for now  feedback would be much appreciated ,1
tokyo disneyland refund   still waiting,has anyone else from the uk received a refund for tickets they bought for tokyo disneyland  we applied on the same day that the form was available and still nothing  does anyone know if there is a way for us to chase it up or how long it ll take ,1
travel itinerary,hey folks  would love some feedback on our travel plan  this trip wont be very adventurous as we re not going for that long  it s my third time going  but my fiancees first time  and we ll be going for our honeymoon  some days don t have anything set because we have a bunch of things down but  i d love some input on the jr pass too 1  so with the travel we have listed  i have checked multiple jrpass calculators and they currently say we save about  30 ish if  we get the pass  but it s close  still unsure whether we ll be getting one 2  a big thing that will determine about the jr pass is the travel from haneda to universal  two options being a  bullet train or b  fly  current plan below goes with a 3  we d be flying with japan airlines  i ve heard great things about their economy class  especialy as premium economy is double the price  1 5k  gt   3k  anyents on their economy class would be a nice input too the travel dates that are listed are heavily subject to change  it was just to make things easier to plan  obviously with the virus we highly doubt we ll be travelling on the dates selected  our current plan is to check in august for the selected dates  if not  check in october for december  if not  check in december for feb  etc   travel dates   10th   head to the airport and fly out to haneda airport 11th   haneda to universal studios arrive in japan  according to the flight we checked  we will arrive in japan at around 3 4am  from there we will take the airport line to shinigawa station  gt  bullet train to shin osaka  gt  osaka station  gt  universal  city station    this would get us to universal city around 10am at the latest  from there we would leave our luggage in the hotel until we can check in  and head over to osaka aquarium to force us to stay awake to avoid that horrible jetlag  after that we ll just grab some food and head to the hotel for the night and get an early  night 12th   kyoto we will travel from universal city to kyoto  less than an hour travel  from there we ll go to arashiyama bamboo forest  walk around for an hour or two  and then head to the train to go to fushimi inari shrine  we wont be going all the way to the top  as much as it would be cool  it s just not something we re too big on doing  we ll be going about halfway  quarter way  after that we ll go down the fushimi shrine markets and get some evening food at the gion market street  by that time i imagine it ll get late so we ll head back to osaka universal city   13th   universal studios not really much needed on this  just going universal studios 14th   universal studios again  day 2 of universal  this one is subject to the nintendo world being open though  we think with the fastpass we could get everything we want to ride done in a day  but if nintendo world is open we d want to relax 15th   osaka  gt  tokyo this date can also be the 14th  depending on if we did one or two days in universal  this travel plan would be the return from the 11th  from there we would check into our hotel in tokyo and then wander around the area and relax 16th   tokyo disney this date is subject to change with all the dates below  this is just because on this specific month  this date falls on a friday so we avoid the weekend   17th   21st tokyo basically just going around tokyo doing stuff we want to do  shinjuku  skytree  shibuya  sunshine city  palette town  arcades  shrines  shopping  basically just relaxing  stuff we can do in and around tokyo as its my partners first time 22nd haneda airport   back to nyc other information  if we only do one day of universal  we d do two days at disney and do both parks  again it just depends on if nintendo world is open by the time we get to go  whether that be oct  dec  feb  etc  we d have 5 full days and 1 day for when we get back from osaka  so about 5 and a half days in tokyo  we have a list of things we d want to do  examples are above  we re sure that could definitely fill out 5 days  anything else we wanted to do we feel is far too far away  like the zao fox village  we just dont want to be travelling the whole trip  hence why we put down 5 days in tokyo  so we re enjoying the area without being stuck on a train  and gives us opportunity to have a really slow and lazy day if we need it  as the fox village for example would take away 2 days for travelling  and would mean we go into yet another hotel    again  travel dates are heavily subject to change as we just wanted an idea down  we highly doubt october will be possible  especially has we also saw that disney florida cancelled their halloween event  which was one thing we really wanted to do in japan  granted i havent seen anything about cancelling any other countries but it s still disappointing    if we went in december it would probably fall to early december to avoid the late  christmas traffic  if we went in jan it would be the later month  to again avoid traffic  feb ive heard is quiet anytime so we dont mind any date    we re not bothered about having a day in osaka  my first trip was just osaka and it was great  but we d rather just see tokyo  anyway  i think that s everything  any feedback or advice would be greatly appreciated  the other two times i went was with someone who lived in japan so it wasn t much on me to head the operations  but now im the one planning so i want to make sure im taking everything into account edit  i thought of another question  can suica cards be used for travel in tokyo and osaka  kyoto or will i need to get the osaka variant ,1
looking for advice  trains  theme parks  museums ,starting to plan a trip next year  hopefully post covid to tokyo for a conference and looking for advice and suggestions  tentatively traveling may 2021  arrive monday afternoon depart saturday afternoon  i ll have monday night  friday afternoon and evening and saturday morning and afternoon free i m generally a junkie for transportation  infrastructure and 20th century history  really want to do list includes shinkansen triptokyo sky treeone of the railway museums japan air safety center  jal 123 exhibit either fuji q highland or tokyo disney seai m considering a few ideas to get at some of the big pieces for the rail museum  i m thinking i can either do the jr museum in kyoto or nagoyabined with a shinkansen trip on friday afternoon or do the jr museum in tokyo one day and save friday to take a rail trip north through the seikan tunnel   is one of the museums hugely better than the others  am i over hyping taking a 10 hour round trip train ride to go through the tunnel tokyo skytree i m assuming i can check out either early one am or late in the evening on a conference day does a half day for fujiq highland or disney make sense  i m from florida so really only want to check out a few of the unique attractions if i went to disney  but leaning towards fujiq unless disney  is good to go after 5p one day for a few rides and fireworks  thinking i can do a few hours at either park  like 6  on saturday before flying out i ll plan to check out the air safety center either arriving or departing while i m near haneda i m assuming getting to hiroshima is a non starter as a day trip because i ll get there too late for anything to be open unless i play hooky one day also  evenings in tokyo  around shunjuku or elsewhere  what to see  where to eat  i m a sumo fan and a budding kendoka if there are any ideas related to those thanks in advanceedit  thanks for all of the advice and suggestions  obviously i was planning to bite off more than i could chew   i m adjusting my plans to arrive in tokyo 24 hours earlier  sunday afternoon  and will likely spend monday on business in hiroshima  that addition will cover my  shinkansen fix and i ll spend friday afternoon and saturday exploring tokyo ,1
tokyo vr zone webket tokyo japan credit card fraudulent charge,this week i noticed a charge for 0 01 cents from  webket tokyo jpn  which after looking up my email  is thepany that managed online tickets for tokyo vr zone in shinjuku  closed last year i thought maybe their database has been hacked  because my visit there was 3 years ago  they could be testing the card with a small transaction to determine whether the card is active  so please check your transactions since lots of people here also visited vr zone in the past ,1

trip report  dec 2019 tokyo   osaka with big family of children and elderly  9 people , introduction hello everyone this is my first trip report of my first time in japan  i traveled with a big family of 9 people  with 3 kids  ages ranging from 7 to 12  as well as our grandmother who is about 65 years old  i hope this trip report inspires others here who are intending toe to japan with bigger families  especially some of the mistakes we made and how we would do it better in the future disclaimer  this is a longgggg post with our day by day itinerary  if you d like some general tips we have about travelling with a big family kids elderly  please scroll to the end of this post  if you have any questions or concerns  i would love to help you with them in any way i can in theents amp x200b day 1  flight from sin   nrt we are from singapore  which will be relatively closer to japan than i believe most of you guys here who might be from the us or europe  if you are in this part of the world  i would definitely rend taking a night flight and landing in japan in the early hours of the morning  just allows you to capitalist on the day and it wouldn t be that bad anyway since its only a 6 7 hour flight to tokyo for us though  we had to tackle some challenges and ended up taking a day flight instead  our elderly grandmother and my mother have trouble with sleeping on planes  especially on night flights  usually ending up feeling sick or having headaches after the flight  for these reasons we decided to take a day flight after our touchdown in nrt  we booked a seat on their airport express bus  which was about a 2 5 hour bus ride directly to our first aodation in tokyo  which was hotel century southern tower i personally really loved this aodation  if a little overkill for our needs  we didn t use much of the hotel facilities but we absolutely loved the proximity to shinjuku station  great accessibility for families with young children that require strollers and elderly that may require wheelchairs  my only qualm about being so near shinjuku station is the morning and evening office crowds are pretty scary for elderly  my grandmother walks pretty slowly and we felt kinda bad that people had to walk around us  rushing to work or back home  and we definitely bumped into our fair share of people  sumimasen  is your best friend here amp x200b day 2  tokyo disneyland this was the day where the adults on the trip realized that juggling the needs of both children and elderly was going to be a challenge the children and myself wanted to really get the most of our disneyland day and even did research on  park strategy  maximizing times on rides and minimizing waiting times   we used this guide by disneytouristblog this of course woulde into conflict with the fact that our grandmother couldn t walk all that much and tired easily  in the end  some of the older adults in the trip like my mother and my aunt decided to sit down at one of their nice overpriced cafes and have tea while i took the kids to play our hearts out we spent the entire day here and really felt like we got our money s worth  as a 21 year old  of course i would have preferred disneysea but seeing the enjoyment on the kids faces was more than worth it amp x200b day 3  national museum of nature  amp  science   akihabara   harajuku the day started with us taking a train to ueno station  it was a pleasant 10 minute walk through ueno park to get to the absolutely stunning whale statue on the outside of the museum  it was really cool that our 3 youngest kids  high school kids category  as well as my grandmother  65 and older  could all enter for free  not that it was too expensive to begin with  you could tell it s very catered to students and we saw quite a number of japanese students on the day we visited content wise there are lots of visual elements within the museum  including my favorite part which was this exhibit of maybe 60 70 life sized animal structures lined up in this massive glass enclosure  we only spent the morning there but you could definitely take your time and stay there for 4 5 hours afterwards  we spent the entire afternoon until evening at akihabara  no need for further rendations on this place  simply walking through the streets is an experience in itself  our favorite shop was definitely super potato  which sells retro game consoles and games  kids are generally fine for akihabara  just need to look out for certain floors of shops that may sell adult content  our grandmother wasn t too fond of this place so she just had a coffee at a cafe in the area at this point it was getting dark  and we decided to have a stroll through harajuku and find a place to eat  personally  our family didn t enjoy harajuku too much  nothing inherently wrong with the place  but we re probably just not the crowd for it  not really into fashion and the kawaii culture  we did however find a jewel of a restaurant at the opposite end of harajuku street from the train station  gyukatsu motomura  it serves wagyu steak breaded and deep fried  but they leave the centers pretty much raw and slice it  you then take each piece and sear the raw sides on this stone grill in the centre of the table  delicious and easily my favorite meal of the entire trip amp x200b day 4  kappabashi kitchen street   senso ji we split into 2 groups to begin the day as some of us took a trip down to kappabashi kitchen street  while the others slept in for a while more before we convened at senso ji shrine  the reason for this was that from our hotel  the easiest way that we could think of to get to kappabashi was to alight at asakusa  where senso ji was  and take a 15 minute walk to kappabashi kappabashi was a nice experience for myself  being somewhat of a cooking and food enthusiast  i purchased a nice kitchen knife for myself and was even able to get my name engraved in the knife  very cool  definitely a place to check out if you work in the f amp b industry or just enjoy cooking when we convened at senso ji shrine  we were really taken aback by just how many people there were there  the markets in front of the shrine were absolutely sprawling with fellow tourists  and we actually fragmented into smaller groups  with different groups finding each other and other groups getting lost  quite a frenzy  definitely hang on to your kids and elderly here  the shrine itself was really nice and quite peaceful  our time at senso ji ended at quite an awkward middle timing  about 4pm  so we kind of didn t know what to do next  the kids were quite exhausted as well from the crowds  we decided to have an early dinner and call it a day  and we ate at ichiran  what we discovered that was really cool about this particular ichiran in asakusa is that they have family tables  this was a massive relief for us  having 9 people and thinking that we would have to each sit at a separate stall  would have been a nightmare for managing the kids amp x200b day 5  joypolis   divercity tokyo plaza another theme park day  but this time indoors  after taking a train to odaiba  we were greeted with a freezing 15 minute walk to decks tokyo beach  the mall that the theme park was in  because the area is so close to the sea and so open with not many buildings in the way  the winds were very strong  dress warm if you re in this area during winter joypolis itself was decent  i wouldn t say its a world class attraction  but it s definitely a unique and quirky theme park that you would have difficulty finding elsewhere  the kids as expected had a blast here  please be cautious of riding the indoor roller coaster if you re like me and have motion sickness  the ride spins around a lot  riding that ride basically floored me for the entire day  it took me hours to recover for the rest of the day  we explored and did some shopping at the shopping malls in the area  mainly divercity tokyo plaza  we managed to catch the gundam statue changing formations  which happens various times in the day and night  my brother is a big gundam fan and really enjoyed the gundam hq  which is this huge gundam store that is catered to be an entire experience  you get to learn everything from its history  to the actual creation of gundam parts  there are also these beautiful exhibits of past winners of the annual gunpla design contests amp x200b day 6  tokyo   osaka a travelling day for us  after breakfast  we rode to tokyo station to sit on our very first shinkansen ride  we had the jr pass  which gave us access to the second fastest train on the tokaido line  the hikari  the train ride experience was pretty great  we bought those bento sets that we could have on the train  and everything is really organised so you get to your seat which can be pre booked  sit back and relax  the train is incredibly smooth and i love that the train banks in the corners  so cool we did however  discover a logistical challenge here  on the hikari shinkansen  your luggage can only be put in front of you or in the overheadpartments  we had 6 7 luggage with us and we couldn t possibly expect the kids to take care of these huge luggage in front of them  so we had to juggle with carrying all those luggage up to the overheadpartment of the train  biggest workout i ve had the entire trip let me tell ya  i was actually really terrified that the luggage would fall as some of the bigger ones were sticking out  but the train ran really smooth and the bags never really budged up there  thank goodness after alighting the shinkansen  we took a local train to namba station and walked to our next aodation  fraser residence nankai osaka  the rooms aren t all that big  my brother and i shared their most basic room offering  we re both pretty big sized  about 6 3  and let s just say we barely had enough space to put our luggage down  if you do however  opt for rooms that have a living room space  which my mother and grandmother shared  it feels much more open andfortable  in fact  on this day we decided that we were too tired and to explore and just decided to chill in their room and have a conbini dinner amp x200b day 7  kyoto day trip looking back  this was one of our regrets of the trip  that regret was not spending longer in kyoto  in my honest opinion  a day trip simply doesn t cut it for kyoto  we wanted to do so much in one day  too much and it was a mistake not to stay a couple nights here to properly visit the attractions  we used our jr pass once again to take the tokaido shinkansen 1 stop to kyoto  about 15 minutes  sounds ridiculous i know but can t pass up the experience to ride on the shinkansen i guess what we did manage to do was to visit the fushimi inari shrine  absolutely filled with tourists especially considering it was a sunday when we visited  my grandmother and mother decided to sit this one out and just explore the lower parts of the temple without taking the long hike up the mountain  not gonna lie  after eating endless amounts of japanese food for the past 7 days  it wasn t an easy climb at all pounded by the fact that we had kids  we got about 3 4 of the way there before we found a little shop that sold soft serve and matcha and we just sat there and enjoyed the view  afterwards  we headed into the downtown area and visited nishiki market  i will say that your experience in nishiki will vary greatly depending on what day you visit  as we visited on a weekend and of course peak travel season for asia  it was slammed with tourists  i could barely squeeze past people  they do have very interesting offerings especially if you re into japanese cuisine  but perhaps a tad impractical to purchase as a lot of their offerings were fresh foods and produce that would pose a challenge to bring home  then again  if you decided to stay in an apartment like an airbnb or something  this would definitely be a cool place to purchase ingredients to cook  after this  we decided to head back early as we had a big day the next day  conbini for dinner amp x200b day 8  universal studios japan the big capstone of our trip  we took the train bright and early to get in the queues to enter usj  most of us had purchased express passes to go along with our tickets and it turned out to be a great investment  all in all  usj is a great experience for all ages  kids have their own little rides and experiences  and the more adventurous ones have their fill with big rides like the flying dinosaur and backdrop ing from singapore  which honestly doesn t have a super impressive universal studios  usj was somewhat of a revelation to me  the harry potter world alone is honestly worth it to visit  being quite the fanboy  i forked out the 60 something singapore dollars for the wand  and honestly had a blast with the interactive elements  the wands allow you to make certain props within the harry potter world move and do stuff  i appreciated the novelty of it all it was very worth it to have express passes for the flying dinosaur as well as hollywood the ride  i m pretty sure each of those rides were about a 60 minute queue that day amp x200b day 9  10 and 11  dotonbori   spaworld osaka  nrt sin having thoroughly exhausted ourselves with the sensory overload and leg pains of a day trip and a theme park back to back  we decided to take the last 2 days slower and really reel in the experience that we ve had  most of our last 2 days were spent shopping and eating at dotonbori  as well as our last day being our  spa day  at spaworld osaka spaworld is this really interesting spa theme park of sorts where you pay a nominal price of about 1200 yen and get to enjoy the entire day enjoying its facilities  like thematic spas  and rest zones with no time limit  we entered just after lunch and spent the entire afternoon there ing out around dinner time  the place honestly wasn t too crowded and its very quiet and peaceful  just what we needed after screaming our hearts out at usj just 2 days earlier we head to the airport the next day and flew back home  thus concluding our very eventful trip to tokyo and osaka amp x200b general advice for travelling with a big family in japan let s be real  tokyo isn t a city built for big groups of any kind  restaurants are small  shops are small  aodations are small  things are really ideal for solo travelers or couples  should that stop you from travelling with your big family  definitely not  we made it work for us and we discovered little tips and tricks along the way  here are just some of them amp x200b 1  expect to eat at different restaurants  or at the very least be separated at different tables i study and work in the service industry  i know the western norm for big families are large tables that servers have to drag together so everyone sits together  it s nice don t get me wrong   but don t expect to be able to do that in tokyo  our familypromised on eating at different restaurants as most of the time we realised that we had different preferences and cravings anyway  just make sure in each party someone has wifi data so that you guys can arrange to meet after you guys eat amp x200b 2  big luggage and bags are a problem when travelling by train if you re a solo traveller or a couple  usually this won t be too much of a problem  when your family is big however  and you have 6 7 bags to take care of it starts to be a problem  trains are crowded in tokyo  and 1 luggage basically takes up the same amount of space a human does  lots of train stations don t have escalators and only have stairs  making you have to turn around and find a lift   you ll have to get creative with your transportation and sometimes you just gotta suck it up and take cars taxis amp x200b 3  it s okay to do different things and separate for a portion of the day i don t mention it a lot in my report  but there are numerous times of the day where we have to temporarily separate for different needs  wants and preferences  kids  youths  adults and elderly all have different needs  and  that s okay amp x200b 4  every family trip needs 2 3  planners  while the rest  follow to balance point 3  i will say that it is ideal if your group of travellers can have 2 3 people who plan and make executive decisions while those who aren t too particular or have strong opinions just follow  for the case of my trip that was my aunt  myself and my mother  we all are pretty good planners ande up with creative ideas to maximize our trip  my brother  uncle and grandmother could focus on helping to take care of the kids while we did so amp x200b fin ,1
trip report  dec 2019,hi everyone  i started writing this a few months ago and never got around to finishing it  this was our  husband and i  third trip to japan and it was for our honeymoon  we generally don t plan too much for our travels  but this time we did a few dinner reservations  stayed at some nice hotels  and went to disney sea i made a very loose itinerary that we didn t really follow  haha i feel like it s more of a place for us to keep track of reservations  days friends can hangout  and aodations  besides that it s sort of a free for all background  in our early mid 30 s  interests  art  books  culture  shopping  food  friends  i speak very elementary japanese and can read hiragana katakana and a bit of kanji flight  nov 30   dec 14  flew from lax to nrt via ana in business class  went back nrt to lax via ana in business class airbnb hotels booked an airbnb in shibuya for the duration of our time  we stayed here the previous year and although small and a bit cramp it has an amazing location and the owner is very nice and aodating  it s between lawson s and 7 11  on a pretty quiet street  except friday and saturday  and next to the cutest curry place wbf hotel namba nippombashijust like our airbnb we stayed here last year on a trip to osaka  it s a fairly new business hotel so the interiors are quite modern  this year the front desk staff spoke more english  but i thought it was easier tounicate in my  limited  japanese  they gave us a corner room so there was a big chunk of space to put things and open the carry on we brought along  something interesting is they have a shampoo conditioner station by the front desk where you can pick which ones you want to use during your stay  tip  they have a free  club  that you can join where you receive points and perks  one of the perks is early check in late check out update  they have recently filed for bankruptcy  not sure if some all locations will close  andaz tokyowe booked this last minute because we saw an offer we couldn t refuse  it s located in toranomon hills in a predominantly financial area so while we were there  fri sun  it was pretty dead  i didn t mind it too much  the nearest train station is a few minutes away  the inside of the place gives a very modern cool vibe  the check in is at long wooden tables and they offer drinks then will show you to your room  we got upgraded to a room with a tokyo tower view and it was amazing  the bed wasfortable  the space was very big  and everyone was very hospitable  i loved the little travel guide they had for fun things to do surrounding the hotel park hyatt tokyofrom the moment we pulled up until we left  there were no words to express how hospitable everyone was  i knew japanese hospitality is next level  but this was something i had never experienced before  some say the interiors are outdated  but i found it to have a classic style  the room was large  a nice view of tokyo  everyone so nice and aidating  i felt like we could ask them for anything and they would try their best  short walk to shinjuku station and across from a park  it was a pretty quiet area day 1   tokyo  arrived at around 4 30pm  went to immigration and at this point i was starting to feel sick but had to tough out the almost 2 hour line  once we got our luggage we exchanged our jr pass and made reservations to get into shibuya by nex  while we waited we picked up our pocket wifi at lawsons  the next nex wasn t going to stop at shibuya so we took it to tokyo station and got a taxi to our airbnb  had a great conversation with our taxi driver about music  movies  anything really  once there we freshened up and unpacked a little then left to meet friends at the koe hotel for the speakeasy tyo event  i still wasn t feeling well so i went back to the airbnb and my husband went to dinner with friends day 2   tokyo   osaka  still not feeling amazing  but we planned to take the jr to osaka so we got up early and went to shinagawa station  the pain was horrendous so i was like fuck it and called kaiser international  they weren t much help but assured me that if i went to the hospital or got care in japan i would be reimbursed so i carried on  we got snacks and got on the shinkansen  once we got to shin osaka station we took a cab to wbf hotel namba nippombashi  i rested and my husband went out and walked around  honestly i spent most of the day inside watching tv and eating ume onigiri  i felt bad i couldn t really do anything day 3  osaka  our one full day in osaka  i was feeling better so we got up and got taiyaki then walked around den den town  my husband is a huge wrestling fan so we stopped by a store and he got a bunch of old merch and figures  we walked to shinsekai to go to a friends store called voyage kids  walked around there then took a taxi to utsubo park  saw the leaves changing  it was so pretty  went to a nearby friend s work to eat  yes  burger  super yummy burgers cooked medium with fries  husband had a high ball too  walked again from there to orange street then amemura to go to mandarake then back to the hotel for a break  unfortunately fell asleep and woke up super late and just walked around  went in a few stores then called it a night day 4  osaka   tokyo  packed up all the things we bought and checked out of the hotel  took a taxi to shin osaka station  got ume onigiri  basically lived off these the first week  banana milkshakes  and shinkansen back to shinagawa station  unpacked  rested  then had yakiniku with a friend  went to another quieter part of shibuya to see another friend and hungout for a bit   day 5   shibuya   koenji  first full day in tokyo  had soba for breakfast and walked around shibuya a little  had a slow start  met up with a friend also visiting tokyo to go to koenji  walked around  went shopping  had another banana milkshake  went to a store rended by a friend called kiosco  we had dinner reservations at udatsu  but i still wasn t feeling 100  so i cancelled it  i didn t think i could handle an omakase dinner  went back to shibuya to rest then had dinner with friends instead day 6   shibuya   ginza   shibuya   harajuku  this was the first really cold day  i got my husband some kairo to stick on his clothes haha  had lunch with a good friend at shunsai in the shibuya excel hotel  it was our first time having a kaiseki meal and it was really good but a lot of food  view was amazing  we caught up and he told us about all the construction in shibuya  went to his bookstore after and saw some rare things and my husband bought some books  we checked into the andaz  a little after we got settled in our room they sent us sake and chocolates for our honeymoon  it was so sweet  later we met with our friend at the muji hotel where she was staying  checked out the hotel then went to shibuya and walked to harajuku for a friends legalize tokyo pop up  went to the chrome store to see another friend working there and a pop up paint event  had dinner at a pizza pasta place with a bunch of friends from visiting tokyo  i ordered a vegetable pizza that was literally a pizza with a whole salad on top  i never had that before haha  it was so lovely to see everyone though  i was so happy   day 7   ginza   shibuya  ordered breakfast at the andaz  it was a lot and was good  had a lunch reservation at ginza iwa and we were honestly unsure if we should keep it because of some of the reviews we saw  specifically about the basement where they put foreigners  we ended up not being seated in the basement and the sushi was great  this was our first omakase experience so it was all new to us  the chef and host spoke some english  but i talked to them in my subpar japanese  walked around ginza in the pouring rain then back to the hotel for a bit before dinner with friends we hadn t seen in two years  had nabe in shibuya also for the first time and i already knew i was going to like it  haha after dinner we went to an izakaya to catch up day 8   tokyo  checked out of the andaz and back to our airbnb  hungout with an old friend  he drove around tokyo  randomly saw steven seagal in asakusa went to a few small art exhibits and nakano broadway  called it an early night  but my husband went out with friends  i was too tired  but i remember being half awake and hearing them say bye through the window  ha day 9   omotesando   harajuku  had lunch at tagetsu  i was nervous because i knew it would be a lot of food and my stomach body still wasn t feeling right  we were seated at the counter between a couple and friends celebrating a birthday  the owner was there and supervised everything being made  it definitely was a lot of food but it was good and i appreciated all the thought and work that went into it  they had coasters that explained each course in english or someone woulde by and tell us what we were eating  we didn t finish our rice course so they made it into onigiri for us to take home  after lunch my husband and i parted ways  he went book shopping and i walked around harajuku day 10   ueno  shinjuku  shibuya  another lunch reservation day at tempura shimomura  we stopped at ueno park and bentendo temple  it was our first time in this area and we really liked the park and people watching  shimomura was in a quiet neighborhood  the chef and host were friendly and the tempura was good  it wasn t oily and tasted so good with just a little salt  i definitely kept burning my tongue  husband and i went separate ways again after lunch  i think he went book shopping again and i went to isetan  we met for dinner and had j s curry day 11   disney sea   naka meguro  attempted to wake up early for disney sea but that didn t happen  we got there probably around 10 00 am and it was already pretty packed  expected  the lines for anything and everything were pretty long so my expectations weren t my reality  but i m okay with that  we waited in line for almost 2 hours to ride journey to the center of the earth and it broke when we were halfway there so that sucked  we took an amazing pic with donald duck  had a late lunch at the teddy roosevelt lounge  we rode a lot of the lowkey rides and walked around a lot  the decoration and attention to detail were so cool  for example  it was almost christmas so each port was celebrating it in their own way  after disney sea we went to naka meguro to do some shopping at wacko maria  hit up a random bar that looked cool and ended up staying awhile  to end the night we had ramen by our airbnb  i had the best yuzu ramen  it was one of my most favorite things i ate on this trip day 12   shinjuku   nakano  time to leave our airbnb so we packed everything and took a taxi to the park hyatt  checked in and they gave me a honeymoon bouquet  unpacked our stuff in our room then walked to isetan  i did a bit of shopping then we went to nakano  ate at a lotteria  walked around  did a bit more shopping at nakano broadway  came back to shibuya and had dinner at aona for gyukatsu then bought a check in luggage because we knew we needed it  back at the park hyatt they left us a bottle of champagne for our honeymoon  attempted to drink most of it but ultimately fell asleep from exhaustion day 13   had breakfast at the girandole buffet  husband went to akiba and i went to shibuya for last minute things  i stopped at parco first to check out the jump store and cdg girl then i dropped off some film to get developed  next was tokyu hands to get stationary stuff  daiso  and 3 coins  had a quick lunch at genki sushi  picked up photos  got a call from my husband  he met up with a friend and they were going to pick me up  we went to a few shops in ebisu and daikanyama  had another banana milkshake  vegan  and he dropped us off at our hotel  we rested then walked to shinjuku to try and go to a drug store  but it was too hectic so i 86 d it  our bookseller friend helped put together the bollocks exhibit at bookmarc so we stopped by to see him one last time before we left  had dinner with a friend at another friend s work  it was a small restaurant with huge yummy portions  i unfortunately didn t finish my food   after dinner  our friend dropped us off at donki to get more last minute stuff and we took a taxi to the hotel day 14  narita  woke up early to have breakfast at the girandole buffet again  since it was our last day they sat us next to the window so we could have a view of tokyo  i know my husband had an omelette and i wanted to try every bread they had to offer  after breakfast we finished packing  tetris  and got ready to head to the airport  the day we checked into the park hyatt  they asked if we wanted to arrange a limo bus to narita when we leave  so we took them up on that  someone came and got our luggage and we went down a little before our bus came  they handed us the tickets and we were off  it was very simple and i m glad we ended up going that route instead of taking the train  there were a few other stops  but it was a very smooth ride  we got to narita and had to have our new luggage wrapped because it wasn t closing properly and we were scared it would pop open  after checking in our luggage we went to the ana lounge until it was time to board  flight was fine  nothing wild happened   other notes  got the 7 day jr pass and used it for the nex and trip to osaka and back  bought disney sea tickets from loppi machine in lawsons  exchanged money at conbini through the atm  used google maps on a daily basis and was correct 90  of the time  had 2 pocket wifi  pre ordered pocket wifi before we left and picked it up at lawsons in narita basement   had one with our airbnb  realized i have pretty severe gerd on this trip which is why i wasn t feeling well half the time   as a result  was taking ohta isan frequently  i love the pajamas in hotels  i also love the winter decorations  don t open close taxi doors  it s done for you  we walked a lot  we love walking  bringfy shoes socks  i spoke a lot more japanese on this trippared to past ones  too shy scared  and i think it was appreciated on both ends photos from the trip all in all it was another amazing trip to japan  if you have any questions feel free to ask  oh and if you re all interested  i could do an album for food as i took pictures of pretty much everything i we ate ,1

decision for spring 2021 trip,a few of us had originally planned a 2 week trip for spring of this year  late march into april  but we all know how that panned out  as such  we rescheduled our trip for this same time in 2021  initially  we would just take the schedule we d planned out and use it next year  but we ve since decided to turn that 2 week trip into 3 weeks that leaves us with the current dilemma of picking between a couple places we had left of to fill some of this new time  and i was hoping to pick the brains and opinions of the lovely people here  i ll preface at least these couple options by saying that we re aware of fine with some more train time to see the points we want to  and we re also aware that public transport won t be quite as great or far reaching in these areas we re looking to allocate a few days  4  in the april 9 16ish area to either some amount of the wakayama peninsula kumano area  ise  nachi hongu taisha  maybe kushimoto  or fukui  maruoka castle  eiheiji  tojinbo  as well as some other coastal scenic points of interest  such as the rive lakes near kiyama  any thoughts that any of you have regarding one or both of these places would be greatly appreciated ,1
visiting mt fuji  not to climb  and fuji q in october 2020 questions,we re looking at doing a day trip to mt fuji from shinjuku in october 2020  we would like to get as close as possible to mt fuji e g  a town near the base and enjoy the view  not climb it  and also visit fuji q theme park and do some rides there  what would be a good town   place to visit that is easily accessible by train   bus to have a good view of fuji and maybe grab some food  even just a 7 eleven  what would be the best transport to get from shinjuku to fuji q to a town closer to fuji and back again   amp x200b thanks ,1

summer 2021 trip  ,edit  im scrapping the first half of this trip and ditching hokkaido so ill make another post once i get some new ideas hello guys  i ve recently saved enough money to finally travel and explore japan a little  i plan to go around june  maybe early july for 2 weeks and possibly a few days more  i plan on hopping around a bit so if someone can give me insight on if i am doing too much then please do so    i have at most rough ideas of how this will go so i am very open to any new ideas  i apologize in advance if this post is too long too  i m still quite unsure of alot of things for reference  i ve never been to japan but have studied japanese for the past few years and mostly aware of basic do s and dont s in terms of social rules  my japanese isn t too bad and i think i could get by using it if needed if rending places things to do  i mainly enjoy parks and nature  really wanna see a bamboo forest  but not really too interested in heavy shopping or places crowded with tons of people  some places i want to see though will have large crowds and i hope some of you can guide me to the best times to visit   my main goal from this trip is to visit places with beautiful nature  visit some temples  eat good food  and do minimal shopping  i want a medium slow paced trip  not too rushed  this is embarrassingly what i only have so farday 1  arrive in sapporo in the morning  air bnb for the next few days  very chill day  visit 7 11  super excited for convenience stores  a rotary sushi if i can  and 1 2 parks day 2  day tour visiting some places in hokkaido like shirogane pond  asahiyama zoo  and farm tomita day 3  chill day  maybe visit hokkaido university botanical gardens  light shopping  etcday 4  leave to go to hitoyoshi in the morning  all the way in kyushu  this is where im most unsure  i was planning on taking a full train bus ride down there  jr pass  but now im thinking it might be too long  so im leaning towards just flying to fukuoka from sapporo  and then bus to hitoyoshi from fukuoka  arrive to hitoyoshi around night  airbnb  somewhere day 5  hitoyoshi is perhaps the city i want to visit the most due to one of my favorite anime s being inspired by some beautiful landscapes  i ve seen others take 2 3 days to visit the locations  so thats what i plan on doing  i will visit some of the landmarks this day day 6  visiting more landmarksday 7 leave early morning to go to a ryokan for 1 night  explore more of hitoyoshi day 8 activate 7 day jr pass and head to osaka arrive in late afternoon and chill day 9  visit places day 10  visit more places in osaka and aroundday 11  go to nagoya or kyoto or tokyo maybe  im not sure  but i will stay relatively around this city for the next few days up until i go home day 12  day 13 day 14 day 15   possibly day 15 16  head on home,1

21 days trip april 25th   may 16th 2021   tohoku and shimanami kaido,hey guys  saw tickets for half the price we paid for our last trip in june 2019  so here we are again  in 2019 we did the golden route of tokyo  gt  kyoto  osaka  nara  himeji   gt  hiroshima  miyajima   gt  kawaguchiko  this time i was hoping to catch a glimpse of the cherry blossoms  so decided to head up to northern japan  it s the beginning stages of planing and i m having doubts about aplishing everything i want to  our first trip was rather slow paced and i m having trouble figuring out if this one is too fast paced  so far it is looking something like this  april 24th   fly out of toronto april 25th   arrive in narita and travel to akita prefectureapril 26th   travel to kakunodate for a day trip to see cherry blossoms april 27th   travel to lake tazawa and up to nyuto onsen for the night  i have tattoos so this is still up for debate april 28th   travel to aomori prefecture in the city of hirosaki  see the cherry blossoms and castleapril 29th   spend the whole day relaxing and enjoying cherry blossomsapril 30th   travel to fukushima prefecture may 1st   ebisu spring matsuri at ebisu circuitmay 2nd   ebisu spring matsuri   travel back to tokyo in the eveningmay 3rd   wait out the remainder of golden week in tokyomay 4th   ghibli museum may 5th   kameido shrinemay 6th   travel to kyoto osakamay 7th   osaka aquariummay 8th   travel to onomichi and start the shimanami kaido  stay overnight on one of the islandsmay 9th   visit okunoshima island andplete the shimanami kaidomay 10th   travel from imabari back to tokyomay 11th   possible day trip to gunma area for initial d cafe may 12th   odaiba for sega joyopolis and shoppingmay 13th   finish any souvenir shoppingmay 14th   travel to fuji five lakes region for the pink moss around mount fujimay 15th   rent bikes and explore fuji five lakes regionmay 16th   travel back to haneda for flight home my main concern with this itinerary is obviously the amount of travel and hotel switching  trying to travel from up north all the way down to onomichi is a lot of time spent on trains  as it s our second trip and i m unsure if another trip would be anytime in the near future  i desperately wanted to check things of of my bucket list  which would be to see cherry blossoms andplete the bike route of shimanami kaido  the plan was to get a 21 day jr pass since we lucked out on the ticket price  but im wondering if flying from sendai to osaka andpleting the tohoku and onomichi area of the trip would be smarter  and only purchasing a 14 day jr pass  any advice or criticism would be greatly appreciated  has anyone done such extensive travel on their trip before  thanks ,1

guide map to the goldent route   options,the classic trip to japan have long been  i and think still is  what people call the  golden route  quickly  the itinerary would be to visit tokyo  take the shinkansen to kyoto osaka with the optional detour to hiroshima one thing is sure  this route is still highly popular  but a lot of people are trying to customize their experience of this classic route  the aim of this guide map is to offer an highlight of the different transport options between the different regions and possible stops and daytrips that are in distance of the golden route amp x200b map available here amp x200b how to use it the general idea is to start in kanto or kansai and reach the other regions  or loop back to your point of origin   there is several options on how to plan your trip  you can decide to have a limited number of  hub  that you will use to do day trips or overnight trip  follow a route and change aodation frequently  make a stop on the way between two location  or even a mix of all  the main routes on the map are to show what are the easiest option when planning your next move all the points and routes are divided in 5 groups  city and routes include links to japan guide  japantravel and other relevant links for transportation options when available 1  kanto   centerer on tokyo2  5 main routes between tokyo and chubu  4 of them could be split in 2 routes from tokyo to nagano matsumoto  then 4 routes from there to chubu 3  chubu   centered on nagoya and toyama as transport hub4  4 main routes between chubu and kansai5  kansai   centered on osaka and kyoto  this include route to hiroshima legend  shape     star   top 5  classic golden route      big square   most popular location     small square   lesser know location  color     blue   transport hub or day trips and detour inside the 3 main regions     various color   main routes and stop on each of the routes between the different regions     black   international airport and extra routes  to show more options  or to reach  daytrip  destination transport this map is centered on the use of public transportation  obviously  jr does offer access to many of these location  so the jr pass or one of the regional pass can be a good option  however  some routes would require to use private railway  bus or other method of transportation  highway bus are also available between several of these locations  look at city and routes  they includes links to train bus pass  here are other links not in the map   japan guide rail pass list note   tips several locations can be done as day trips  but many would benefit from an overnight stay to have more time to visit or or even better  to enjoy a ryokan with onsen not all possible railway and bus lines are indicated here  you can research a bit more the transport options for each points  japan guide is a good start as they have access pages for most location when looking at rail pass pare different scenarios and try to be creative  for example  even if you can use the jr pass to go to nikko  look at tobu nikko pass in addition  this can allow you to be more relax on your schedule for the trip to nikko  give you more time on your jr pass to go to kansai and it also include local bus  similarly  if  you want to stop by hakone on the way to kansai  you might want to start the jr pass when you leave hakone  so you can have one extra day of jr pass to spend in kansai for the price of the transport from tokyo to hakone amp x200b note  doing some major additions1  add prefectures outline2  will move all city in the region group and only keep the main routes in the routes group3  add more location  7 8 by prefecture 4  add more information  major attraction and local dish5  adding emoji for some major highlight  onsen  shrine temple  nature  garden  castle  sakura  autumn color  great view amp x200b to help you can  send links to add to the transport list or to any point route  suggest more points  any otherent  should i add extra links when available  such as jnto and regional tourism websites  ,1
trip report oct 2016 9 days in japan  osaka  tokyo  kyoto  nara  mt  koya,just so everyone knows  this trip was in oct 2016  so some things might not be the same anymore  i just thought i d share my experience as i really enjoyed reading some of the other trip reports  i have since gone to japan once every year  so i will be posting more later this was my first trip to japan  so the trip was planned around the major tourist attractions in each area  i m not religious at all  but i love visiting japanese temples shrines for context  this was a solo trip  i am asian m  from vancouver  canada   was 26 at the time  with some basic knowledge of japanese being able to read kanji tips booking  i used airbnb and booking for this trip  i would rend that you start planning and booking aodation at least 4 5 months in advance as the nicer airbnb ryokans are usually fully booked quite early navigation and transit  google maps is a must  look up the transit routes ahead of time and allocate more time for transfers as you will get lost within the train stations  especially if you don t know kanji  the best thing about japan s transit system is that it is extremely punctual  even in the country side  this makes it easier to plan  once you leave the major cities the frequency of trains and buses are low  like once every 2hrs  so plan ahead  get a suica icoca card so you don t have to buy a ticket for every trip  its also accepted at convenience stores so just get one weather  alot of people say that fall is the best season to visit japan and i would agree  but as someone from vancouver  i would say october was still too hot for my liking  it was still around 28 33c for most days  november is much more pleasant and the leaves start turning red so i would rending then instead language  most japanese people don t speak english  even if they speak a little  most are too shy to do so because they don t want to give you wrong information  so they will just keep repeating themselves in japanese while you ask them in english  so learn a few basic phrases in japanese in case you need help finding something oct 4  osaka dotonbori   shinsaibashi flight from hkg to kxi peach airline mm064 oct 4 12 30 17 15 pretty decent for budget airline  better than the european ones i ve taken  food   drinks   checked in baggage not included my airbnb was located in namba  i really rend staying in this area if you plan on taking multiple side trips to kyoto nara mt  koya  it is close to alot of the attractions in the city such as dotonbori  shinsaibashi  kuromon market  and denden town after checking in i walked to  dotonbori and shinsaibashi  for some street food  the takoyaki  okonomiyaki  and gyoza were awesome  this is also where the famous  glico  man neon sign is  the stores at shinsaibashi closed relatively early  9pm  so i went to the donquijote by the canal  if you ve never been to donquijote  go check it out  it has everything from snacks  liquor  beauty products  electronics  halloween costumes  sex toys etc it s also open till very late unlike most japanese stores i didn t know beforehand  but the side streets near dotonbori is actually a red light district  by the time i came out from donquijote it was already 1am  and there were lots of pimps hosts soliciting  there were even some girls on the streets  i was just there by myself  being asian they thought i was japanese and i got approached around 10 times within a 10 minute walk  so keep this in mind if these situations make you ufortable  the key is to not respond at all  or else they will just keep talking to you oct 5  osaka sumiyoshi taisha   shinsekai   abeno   denden town as most things in japan open quite late in the morning  i went to  sumiyoshi taisha  when i woke up early in the morning  i m surprised i don t see this place mentioned more  as it was a very picturesque shinto shrine  it has one of those arched japanese bridges that takes you across a pond   temple   bridge after that i made my way to observation deck at  abeno harukas  which is the tallest building in osaka  the view was amazing   i then made my way to  shinsekai  and had some kushiage  which is basically deep fried skewers  i really rend getting lotus root and shrimp  i did not go up to the  tsutenkaku  tower at shinsekai as it was just next to harukas  so i didn t think it was worth going up i then walked to  denden  town  which is probably best described as osaka s akihabara  there are tons shops here that sells anime goods and video games here  some are brand new and some are second hand  you can find some really retro stuff here that are kept in pristine condition even though they re second hand  my 2 favorite stores there are jungle and super kids land  i found the prices here cheaper than akihabara oct 5   6  tokyo 1 day trip of tokyo  odaiba oedo onsen   tsukiji fish market   sushi dai   akihabara flight from kxi to nrt peach airline mm319 oct 5 19 00 20 25 i only decided to do this 1 day trip to tokyo because tsukiji fish market was supposed to close at the end of the year and i really wanted to see it  the flights were really cheap  round trip was around 7500 yen  but having experienced the shinkansen in my other trips  i would very much rend taking that instead of flying  as the shinkansen stations are right in the middle of the cities and you waste less time travelling to the airports landing at narita at around 9pm i took the bus to tokyo station then transferred to the yurikamome line to odaiba to the  oedo onsen  the oedo onsen is open throughout the night  other than just the onsen they also have a rest area  there are also food stalls and matsuri games  i stayed there for a few hours to get some sleep before i head over to  tsukiji fish market  to catch the tuna auction getting there at 4am  there were already like 60 70 other tourists waiting outside  i was one of the last people to get the ticket to the tuna auction  after explaining how we should behave at the auction  the staff lead us into the market and there were hundreds of  gigantic tuna   200lb  laid on the floor for the buyers to inspect before bidding  the whole bidding process was an interesting watch  but kinda confusing  i m still not quite sure how it works  you can find videos of it on youtube the auction ended at around 5 30am  and i headed straight to the  outer market    which is where all the food stalls and sushi restaurants are at tsukiji  i m usually not a big fan of lining up for restaurants  but i thought i d try  sushi dai  which is by far the most popular restaurant at tsukiji   at 5 30am there were already around 100 people in line ahead of me  and i ended up waiting for about 4hrs to get in  to start off  everyone was required to get the 10 pc omakase set  when you finish  you can order a la carte  my favorite pieces were the  abalone  and horse mackerel  i ordered 5pcs after the omakase set  i think the total was around 7500 yen  overall  i would say that sushi dai was very good  but i would 100  not wait in line for 4hrs for it  given there are alot of other sushi restaurants in the market  after the sushi  i felt like i could still eat more so i went on to get some grilled scallops  tamagoyaki  tuna sashimi from the food stalls  there s also a few stores in the market that sells traditional japanese kitchenware so check that out too  the outer market at tsukiji is still open to this day despite the actual fish market itself is moved to toyosu i left tsukiji around noon to head to  akihabara  i noticed so many girls advertising themed cafes in the area  i was actually a bit curious  some had ninja costumes  maid costumes etc  but the whole thing just seemed too bizarre if i went by myself lol  so instead i spent a few hours shopping for niche electronics  anime goods  and tried my luck at the claw machines  didn t get anythingt t at around 5pm i started heading to narita for my flight back to osaka  exhausted due to the lack of sleep flight from nrt to kxi peach airline mm320 oct 6 20 55 22 25 oct 7  osaka museum of history   osaka castle   museum of housing and living   nakanoshima river cruise   umeda sky building i really rend getting the amazing osaka pass as it gives you free admission to alot of attractions and unlimited usage for local transportation in osaka  the admission for all the activities on this day was covered by the pass museum of history  was right beside osaka castle and is covered by the pass so i thought i d check it out  there are museum has an audio guide and you can learn about how osaka has changed throughout history up until the showa era  there s also a lookout point where you can get a very good  view  of osaka castle here is one tip i would give when visiting  osaka castle  on a hot day  only go during the early morning or late afternoon  the castle is surrounded by a huge park area and there is literally no shade while you line up to get in to the castle  the castle was rebuilt after being damaged during the war  so everything is pretty modern inside  you actually need to take an elevator to get to the top of the castle i then headed to the  museum of housing and living  which is a rebuild of what the streets of osaka looked like during the edo period  you can even go into most of the buildings to see how the interior of japanese houses and shops looked at the time  you can also rent a kimono for photos  it was quite crowded so i didn t spend that much time there after buying some beer at the convenience store i took the  nakanoshima river cruise  along the river they put lights on the trees  and as it was getting dark the skyscrapers by the river also turned on their lights  and the night view was amazing  the cruise was actually only around 15 minutes  but it was so relaxing to be drinking beer as the boat slowly cruised along the river  the whole environment was very romantic  perfect activity for couples   view from boat my last spot for the day was another spot that is perfect for couples  the observation deck on the  umeda sky building  the rooftop is open air and gives you a 360 degree view of the city  while there are fluorescent lights on the floor of the deck  giving it a very dreamy vibe  it is a very popular attraction though  i had to line up for about 40 minutes to get up there oct 8  nara kyoto nara park   todai ji   kasuga taisha   arashiyama   tenryuji i took the kintetsu line from namba station to nara station  right outside the station  there is a shotengai with lots of local foods  remember that video of the 2 japanese men pounding mochi really fast  this is where it was filmed  the store s name is nakatanidou   you can actually watch them pound the mochi in front of the store  the mochi itself is very good  definitely rend trying continue to walk down sanjo dori street where nakatanidou was and you will enter nara park  it is a beautiful park and there are multiple shrines temples   you just have to follow the signs  there are lots of deer in the park and some will approach you and bow to you if you bought the biscuits  there s just something very magical seeing the deer chilling in the temples and shrines   todai ji  is a must  it is the world s largest wooden architecture  and the massive bronze buddha statute inside is incredible   kasuga taisha  is a 1300 yr old shinto shrine and it is beautiful  the colors of the pillars are alot brighter than what you usually see at other shinto shrines  there are alot of stone lanterns along the path to the entrance  i can only imagine how amazing it will look when they re turned on at night after finishing up at nara  i headed for  arashiyama  in kyoto  i took the kintetsu line from nara station to kyoto station and transferred to the san in line to arashiyama  arashiyama is one of my favorite places in japan  most people only know it for the  bamboo forest  but there is so much more to it  i also went to the monkey park on top of hill  the area around the train station has multiple high end traditional japanese restaurants that were out of my budget  but there were also alot of stores that sold traditional japanese foods and crafts in the area  togetsu ky  bridge that takes you across katsura river gives you a really nice view of the area  you can also take the sagano scenic train that runs along the river and mountains  unfortunately i didn t have enough time for that   tenryuji  is also in the area  it is a zen temple with a stunning japanese style landscape garden  i wished i had more time to spend in arashiyama  but it was getting late and i had to catch a train back to osaka oct 9  kyoto fushimi inari   kinkakuji   gion   ninenzaka   kiyomizu dera to avoid the crowd at  fushimi inari  i arrived early at around 8 30am  even then it was pretty crowded already at the shrine  the main attraction is hike that takes you through thousands of torii gates along the way  it is really something to behold  it gets much less crowded as you ascend the mountain  so don t be discouraged if you can t get a photo without other tourists in it  just keep going up  i actually hiked the entire thing  but i rend going back down when you hit the yotsutsuji intersection as there wasn t anything noteworthy beyond this point  at the intersection  there is a lookout point where you can get a nice view of kyoto  there is also a restaurant at the intersection if you need to rest a bit before continuing kinkakuji  was a bit out of the way  as it was only accessible by bus  the golden pavilion is built on the edge of a pond inside a beautiful japanese garden  it was super crowded  and you really need to be patient if you want to get a good photo of it without someone blocking you  but the architecture is so beautiful   i think it s worth a visit if you like this kind of stuff  but if you re not  then probably better to spend your time somewhere else as it is out of the way after getting lunch at a convenience store i headed over to the  gion  district  it is such a beautiful neighborhood to walk in with the traditional wooden buildings everywhere  there are alot of expensive restaurants and stores in this neighborhood  if you go in the afternoon  you will see geishas arriving at the ochaya  tea houses    please note that photography in gion s private roads is now banned due to bad tourist behavior to get to kiyomizu dera from gion i walked up  ninenzaka  it is a sloped pedestrian only path that is flanked by traditional wooden buildings  restaurants and cafes  it is one of the best preserved areas in kyoto and is definitely worth exploring  there are some beautiful cafes along the way if you need a rest  a few years ago  starbucks opened a store here with japanese decor like tatami mats  and it even has a tiny garden kiyomizu dera  is known for it s platform that is built upon a hill which gives a panoramic view of kyoto  i got to the temple around 5pm and the sun was starting to go down and the entire city turned red as the sun set  just the sunset alone was worth the visit after a long day i went back to the gion district for a very good but expensive unagi meal at a restaurant called uokeya u oct 10  mount koya okunoin   danjo garan   saizen in temple lodging imagine a town of temples built on top of the mountains  surrounded by ancient forests  and that is mount koya   it is an incredibly zen and beautiful town  and i highly rend anyone to visit and see for yourself it took about 2hrs to get to mount koya from namba station  including a very cool retro looking  cable car  ride up the mountain  i got there at around 9 30am  and it was too early to check in to the room i booked at saizen in temple  so i rented an electrical bike from the tourist center and dropped off my luggage at the temple and just explored the town danjo garan  was right across from saizen in  it is aplex that contains multiple beautifully constructed religious structures such as a massive brightly colored pagoda called  konpon dait    a kamakura period styled building called  fudo do  and much more   night view the main attraction at mount koya of course was  okunoin  okunoin is japan s largest cemetery  yep  you read that right  a cemetery  okunoin is home to more than 200 000 graves and memorials  including japan s famous historical figures such as oda nobunaga  date masamune  akechi mitsuhide  the walk to the temple from the entrance was incredibly beautiful  the stone paved path was flanked by thousands of stone lanterns  ancient cedar trees that look like they are thousands of years old  rays of sunshine making it through the trees to shine on the moss covered graves and memorials  honestly words cannot to it justice  so here are a few photos i took   1   2   3   4   5 there is a guided night tour okunoin that you can sign up for  i chose to go by myself at around 7pm  and it was pitch dark  the vibe at night was very different  the lanterns were turned on and all i could see was the dimly lit path that seemed like it never ends  it really felt otherworldly  i just wish i had a better camera and not just my iphone camera   night view in between my visits to okunoin i checked in to  saizen in temple  where i was temple lodging for the night  the  room  basically looked like rooms at ryokans with the tatami mats and sliding doors  and there was a beautiful japanese  garden  in the temple   at 5pm dinner was served in my room by one of the monks at the temple  dinner was  shojin ryori  which is what buddhist monks eat  it was mainly just vegetables and tofu  but the presentation was really nice  the next morning  i got up at 6am to participate in the morning prayers which lasts about 30 minutes  after breakfast i made my way back to osaka oct 11  osaka umeda   kuromon market   denden town i met up with my friend who lived in japan at  umeda  and we walked around the area   we went to the basement floors of the hankyu flagship department store and the pastries there looked amazing  we then made our way to the pokemon center located in the daimaru  i think this is one of the biggest ones i ve been to  there were tons of merch games for sale and had some pretty cool displays my friend had to go to work in the afternoon  so we parted ways  i then went to  kuromon market  and the food there was amazing  i had some  otoro  fugu  hotate  uni sashimi and grilled seafood  if you are on the fence about eating raw seafood  just try otoro  i promise it will blow your mind  one thing i don t rend getting there is the kobe beef  i tried it out  and i don t think it is worth it as it was quite expensive  and they did a pretty bad job cooking it  go eat kobe beef at a proper yakiniku or teppanyaki restaurant after spending over 15 000 yen on street food  i needed to walk it off  i went back to  denden town  to buy the things that i scouted out last time i was there  after spending hoursparing the prices between different stores i bought 4 dragon ball z figures and 2 big gunpla models and pretty much spent all the yen i had left on me oct 12 flight from kxi to hkg peach airline mm063 oct 12 8 50 11 45 and that s it for my first trip report  please feel free to ask any questions ,1
a place to make rings in tokyo ,i ve done some research on where to make rings in tokyo  but haven t been able to find the right place yet  my boyfriend and i are looking to make promise rings together and think it would be a fun thing to do together  i found a place in nakameguro that seems nice  but we haven t decided yet  do you have any rendations edit for more info  we are looking into making rings on the cheaper side  around 10000 yen per ring or less  in nakameguro they have a ring studio called makers base  but we re looking into more places since we aren t familiar with shops that do this sort of thing  we want to do something creative  so a place we can have fun while making our rings together and somewhere we can add our own personal engravings  designs are best  we re mostly looking for something affordable  we don t need gold and diamonds ,1

covid 19 monthly discussion thread   4th edition  june 2020, the state of emergency has been lifted in japan  but the borders are still closed to international travel  all foreign nationals are being refused entry to the country   and all visa exemptions have been revoked  questions regarding when how soon the borders will reopen  when should i cancel rebook my trip  will be locked to replies  this includes posts that vaguely refer to tourism reopening in japan  we will only report information from verified sources when it bes available  we ve received many posts on the supposed travel reimbursement program and  it has been confirmed by the japan tourism agency  it is only intended to boost local tourism at this time   this rebate will not apply to foreign tourists in the future  please wait until official government announcements are made and protocol established before booking or rebooking any flights  hotels  or other forms of entertainment for any future trips   transit through japan is only possible through narita or haneda  you cannot depart the airport without facing quarantine measures  unless you take a cab from one airport to the other    this is a cost of up to  400 00 usd for a one way trip  if you have booked your trip already  or are flying on a rebooked ticket  please speak to your airline right away if you have any further concerns if you are seeking information on your work school related entry  please go to  movingtojapan s megathread  unfortunately  outside of  nobody is allowed to enter  and we do not know when this will change    there is no further information on that topic that this sub can offer you a backup of the original thread with minor changes is found in our  faq please check  here    for the original post from when this situation began  and  here  for the most recent thread from this event  the first discussion thread is  here  the second edition is  here closure information   june 2020 japan guide has kept an excellent a masterlist of information on their site for any tourists who are looking for information at this time  as this includes a well maintained list of high tourism attractions  and locations in japan  we will now defer to this list for closures   and urge anyone curious to check through to the website  if you have any information on areas reopening  we will allow them to be posted in theents  but the overall list of closures and openings is bing too long to contain in one reddit post  due to character length  so we ask you check in with japan guide for this information at this time    we d like to take this space to remind all those who use this thread that the likelihood of tourism being allowed into the country en masse by the end of this month to be extremely unlikely  there are still a lot of factors in play worldwide that will affect the opening of borders both in japan and many users  home countries  and it should not be assumed that tourism will restart on a large scale this month  or even during this summer season    this well written article from the cbc in canada  gives some good background information and food for thought on international travel once the borders begin to reopen around the world  we suggest you read it fully and apply it to your individual situation  but here are some key points to consider as we await the resumption of international travel     airlines will not be back at full capacity right away    according to a spokesperson for flight center in canada   the airlines aren t going toe back and go to 100 per cent  she said   there s sort of a general agreement that international travel will start toe back around 20 per cent by the fall   like september   and then it ll grow from there  this will present itself as lesser flights  with more seats being unsold to promote social distancing on the plane    even flights that make it to the destination will be subject to restrictions on arrival    from the article    st  lucia and iceland will require that visitors get a covid 19 test before flying and provide proof upon arrival that they re virus free  if travellers to iceland can t get a test beforehand  the country plans to test them when they arrive   if you cannot provide proof that you are virus free on arrival  14 day quarantine may be mandatory    from the article    airline analyst and mcgill university prof  karl moore is set to fly to iceland in august to teach for a couple of days at reykjav k university  but if he can t get tested in canada beforehand  moore is unsure he ll take the trip  that s because  if he tests positive for covid 19 upon arrival  he ll have to foot the bill for a 14 day quarantine in a reykjavik hotel  travellers suffering from covid 19 can t fly back to canada until they recover   returning home  and unable to prove you re covid 19 free  that might be another 14 day quarantine    so if that s 14 days on arrival  14 days on vacation  and then 14 days back home in quarantine  again  you could be out a lot of money covering costs of extra hotel rooms that you didn t intend to stay in on or after your trip   there is no evidence that travel insurance will cover covid 19    from the article    insurance broker martin firestone believes that when canada lifts its advisory against international travel  travel insurance providers may continue to exclude coverage for covid 19 related illnesses   until there s a vaccine  cbc news reached out to several major insurance travel providers to find out if they would resume covering covid 19 related issues when canada lifts its travel advisory  they said they couldn t make a definitive statement at this time    if you get sick on vacation  that s an amount you will have to pay out of pocket  and be aware that on the ground insurance in japan might not even be available to tourists to cover this virus   that september timeline for international travel mentioned above     don t hold your breath  lots of countriesing out of the first wave should be using their precious time to get ready to flatten the curve of the second wave   that s not an if  it s a when    as vaccines are being developed but will still take time to refine  test and distribute   in the meantime  we will still keep the lines ofunication open in this sub on the virus by way of this megathread  we do ask that you refrain from speculating on the when how of reopening because  as you can see  the factors in play right now are too many to give a solid start date  we d also like to note that we will only cover informationing from confirmed government agencies on reopening  travel bans  or restrictions for tourists    as this sub deals only with tourists and tourism  we won t entertain questions on working visas  school visas  teaching visas  or anything outside the realm of tourism  questions or links pertaining to those subjects will be locked and removed   thanks everyone ,1

best place to watch the sunrise in tokyo kyoto hiroshima ,i m traveling to japan this time next year with 2 friends  specifically may 18th  may 30th  and one of the things that i really want to be able to do is to watch the sunrise at least once during my trip  i know japan is known as the land of the rising sun  and it would really mean a lot to me to see the sunrise at least once  specifically  i want a good view of the sunrise where i can get a good picture of it  the three major cities that i am staying in are tokyo  kyoto  and hiroshima  and i really would appreciate any advice someone may have about the best place to see the sunrise in any of them  for tokyo  i saw that kaisai seaside park  toyosu gururi park  and odaiba beach were good places  but they suggested those places around new years time  so i was unsure if that would still be applicable in mid to late may in kyoto i saw that fushimi inari was a good place to watch the sunrise but in may the sun rises early around 4 am and i wouldn t be able to use public transit to get to it before sunrise since public transit is closed in the early morning  i also read that kyoto was in a basin  so it might be harder to see the sunrise in a good location  i even talked to someone who had been to japan and they suggested kamakura beach to me  that s definitely a day trip scheduled from tokyo  but there s no way i could get there in time to see the sun from public transit  unless i took a late train and stayed there until public transit opened back up  i could add an extra night to stay at a hotel but that would push back the rest of my trip any advice suggestions rendations would be very appreciated  here is my  loose  itinerary if it helps to see where i ll be by day may 18th  land in tokyo  i ll mostly be around my hotel for that day to familiarize myself with its surroundings may 19th  morning  harajuku  shopping  cafes  etc  afternoon  shibuya  parco mall  crossing  etc may 20th  day trip to kamakuramay 21st  day trip to chuerito pagoda  ice cave  wind cavemay 22nd  shinjuku government building  extra time for anything else i or my friends may want to do may 23rd  leave tokyo  arrive in kyoto  visit k daiji temple may 24th  fushimi inari shrine and nishiki marketmay 25th  day trip to himejimay 26th  higashiyama  jish ji  philosopher s path  nanzen ji temple may 27th  kita ku district  kinkaku ji  kamigamo jinjamay 28th  leave kyoto  arrive in hiroshima  visit hiroshima castle  peace memorial museum  shukkein gardenmay 29th  possible trip to itsukushima  floating shrine will still be under construction  or this day could be an extra day in tokyo kyoto may 30th  fly from hiroshima to tokyo  then tokyo to back home ,1

suggested by the sub  we were still studying while planning for this trip and as much as it could ve been better  we were pretty worn out with the places and activities we did  watched countless videos of japan places to go and see and also pablofromtokyo on youtube  read through itineraries from this sub and online websites to determine the places we wanted to go  we read through many of the sub advices regarding the mario kart experience and even though it was looked down upon by locals in japan and many on this sub we still decided to proceed with it anyways  as it really intrigued our interest and looked like a really interesting activity  we booked the mario kart experience from govoyagin  we were on a budget as we were both still students and wanted to make the most of what we could  fiance wise  most of the activities we did were booked and paid online through  klook sg  and we purchased our pocket wifi from  changirends  our pocket wifi was free though due to a promo code which glitched the system however later on in the trip the wifi malfunctioned and we had to purchased one in tokyo the following is most of the budget which we planned for everything is in sgd  amp

arrived at narita airport terminal 1 at 0730 local time and it took us around 1hour to get through the customs  after the customs we went to collect the suica card and the keisei skyliner tickets  made our journey to our hotel  hotel monterey hanzomon and checked in our baggage  we then headed down to shinjuku to sight see and ate our lunch at one of the gyukatsu motomura outlets  the queue was pretty short as it was still early for lunch  however  the restaurant was already crowded and the wait was quite a bit  it was our first time having gyukatsu and the experience was satisfying  being able to grill the beef to our own preference  however  we both ordered the extra meat meal  25   and did not managed to finish  we purchased our tickets towards mt fuji for the next day from shinjuku station and headed down to tokyo station  we then bought our nozomi shinkansen tickets for 22 december  spent some time outside marunouchi and the tokyo imperial palace before heading to our mario kart destination  we booked the 2 hour tour  however the total tour was only 1 5 hours  additionally  after the tour  the tour guide asked us for tips instead of it being voluntarily  the tour went by roppongi hills  harajuku  tokyo tower and shibuya crossing  the tour was adrenaline filled and the go karts went fairly fast  we were also given photo taking opportunities  however  driving alongside heavy vehicles and cars at a small go kart really is dangerous and we understood the negative stigma after the tour  this was a once in our life experience and probably never going to do it again after the tour we headed back to nishi shinjuku and had our dinner at uogashi nihon ichi  standing sushi bar  this was a different experiencepared to the conveyer belt sushi places that areon and we got to see the chef prepare the sushi in front of us  the sushi tasted wonderful  however the price was a little high which cost us  40 per person     we loitered around shinjuku area for a bit and spotted the godzilla at hotel gracery before heading back for the night amp x200b day 2   19 december   thursday     fuji chureito pagoda  kawaguchiko lake  gotemba premium outlet  shibuya the second day of the trip was probably the most tiring one as we had to adjust our body clock and woke up at 0500  we headed to shinjuku station and took the jr chuo line 1 5 hours journey towards otsuki station  at otsuki station we missed our train and decided to have an early breakfast at     which was in the station  this was one of our best decision as the hot soba that we ate was very affordable and was very memorable  we then took the fujikyu train towards shimoyoshida station after arriving at shimoyoshida station  we took around 30 minutes before reaching the arakurayama sengen park  the climb up was a bit of an exercise as some of the steps were quite steep  however after reaching the top  we were treated to a spectacular view of mt fuji  on the other hand  the view of pagoda was not as impressive due to the number of china tourist crowding the area  but we managed to snap a few pictures and loitered in the area before heading back down to shimoyoshida station we took the train towards kawaguchiko station and had brunch at the family mart there  the restaurants around the area was either full or overpriced and we did not want to fall into the tourist trap  after lunch  we took the red line sightseeing bus to the end of the line and enjoyed the scenery there  the gift shop also sold ice cream which we enjoyed in the cold weather  however  the view of mt fuji was slightly covered with clouds  the view was still beautiful nonetheless we took the bus back and went to the ropeway station where we took the kawaguchiko ropeway up to enjoy a better view of mt fuji  the cabin was squeezed packed with people  however the scenery at the top was magnificent and we bought the grilled dango which had mt fuji imprinted on it  there was many people at the top but was still fairly easy to take photos and was not very crowded  we then went back to kawaguchiko station and waited for the  bus towards gotemba premium outlet  the bus ride took 2 hours to arrive at the premium outlets  by the time we arrived at the premium outlet  the sun was already setting thus we could not see the view of mt fuji  the stuff at premium outlet was not what we were looking for and we ended up not buying anything  honestly  the premium outlet isn t worth it and we wasted a total of 5 hours for it  we then took the jr express bus back to shinjuku station and went to shibuya for our very late dinner  we ate a yakiniku dinner at the han no daidokoro kadochika restaurant  the service was excellent and the food was superb  however the price was on the high side  85 per person  but it was every bit worth it  we then went back to the hotel and ended our day amp x200b day 3   20 december  friday    asakusa  tokyo skytree  ginza we had a  late rise for this day and rescheduled tsukiji fish market to the next day  once we woke up we headed towards minamisenju station and went to queue outside obana unagi restaurant  the queue for the michelin star unagi was long and we waited for 2 hours before we managed to eat  they have limited servings and serve their lunch customers in two batches  we were in the second batch to enter the restaurant  there were more locals than tourists queuing for the unagi and we knew that it was going to be good  ordered 2 sets of unagi and the unagi omelette and it cost us almost  100 per person  after lunch  we went down to asakusa and visited the senso ji shrine which was filled with tourists  walked around nakamise and nishisando shopping district for a bit and trying out some of the street food along the way we then took a train ride to tokyo sky tree station and shopped at the mall for a bit before heading up to the observation deck  we had a clear view on tokyo s skyline and witnessed the sunset  the tembo galleria isn t necessary and i suggest just visiting the tembo deck  the view of the city remains almost the same and the tembo galleria felt more crowded  we took the train towards ginza and proceeded to dover street market ginza  after shopping  we had our dinner at mugi to olive  the shoyu ramen made from a variety of ingredients was amazing  the restaurant was a little small and we needed to wait for our seats  but the soup and noodles was refreshing after a long and tired day of travelling  if i recall  the price of the ramen per person was around  13 per person  we then took the train back to our hotel to end our day amp x200b day 4  21 december  saturday tsukiji fish market  meiji jingu shrine  harajuku  shibuya we woke up in the morning and went to tsukiji fish market for our breakfast  by the time we arrived  the market was already crowded with locals and tourists  it probably was not the best day to go down to tsukiji as it was a weekend  we then ate a variety of seafood  croquettes  tamagoyaki omelettes  mochis and even tried the uni bun  sea urchin  that was featured on pablofromtokyo  however the taste was too strong for us  tsukiji market pricing was moderate and the food was okay  we enjoyed the market and what it has to offer  spending around  25 each at the market we then made our way down to meiji jingu shrine and spent some time at there  this would be the first shrine that we will visit in our trip  the shrine and its surrounding brought quiet and peace to me  even though it might be occasionally disturbed by tourists talking loudly or children playing  the shrine was also crowded and we managed to witness a small ceremony that took place we proceeded to harajuku to shop around stores like bape  fr2  supreme before heading down to flippers for some late lunch pancake  luckily for us the queue for flippers was not too long and we managed to get seated in 25 minutes  the pancake was  fluffy and decorated with fruits around  in my opinion  flippers tasted good but it is way too overrated  costing around  20 total  after flippers  since there wasn t a queue at the luke lobster right outside  we decided to queue and ordered the sandwich with soup set  the sandwich was a little small for the price we paid but it tasted really good   25 we then decided to head towards shibuya  where our pocket wifi was spoilt  we then needed to get another pocket wifi from shibuya and rented an any fi pocket wifi for the remainder of our journey  the pocket wifi was expensive around  135 for the next 1 week  in my opinion  getting a pocket wifi from the airport is way cheaper than getting it in the city  but we had no choice  we the headed down to the newly opened shibuya parco to visit the nintendo and pokemon store  before heading down for our dinner  for dinner  we had shabu shabu at nabezo  we opted for the premium meat buffet and the beef served was excellent  the dinner costed about  90 per person we then headed back to our hotel to end our night and pack our luggages amp x200b day 5  22 december  sunday tokyo to shin osaka  dontonbori we woke up a tad bit late and did not managed to catch our train for the nozomi shinkansen  this meant that our reserved seatings were forfeited and that the next train we took towards shin osaka would be free seating  we then went to the bento store in the station and bought the bentos before heading to the platform  when the train arrived  it was empty and we managed to secure a seat for ourselves  the trip was around 2 5 hours and along the way many passengers came up onto the train and we were quite lucky to have the seat at the start after arriving at shin osaka  we changed trains and headed to our hotel at sotetsu fresa inn osaka shinsaibashi  we left our baggage for check in and decided to walk around shinsaibashi area and had lunch at the shake shack  we went back to the hotel to check in and rested till dinner time before heading out towards dontonbori we had okonomiyaki for dinner at chibo  okonomiyaki at dontonbori  the japanese pizza was amazing and we also got to see the chef fry the okonomiyaki right before our eyes  additionally  chibo has a halal section  but we decided to eat the normal one   without pork  the okonomiyaki was something different which we have not tried before and was a really good experience   around  25 per person  we walked down towards namba to collect our kansai 3 day thru pass and nankai line airport train tickets  while returning back  we saw a queue for takoyaki and decided to grab some from takoyaki doraku wanaka   namba  the takoyaki tasted good and had 4 different flavors and toppings to go along with we then went back to our hotel to end the night amp x200b day 6  23 december  monday    universal studios japan we chose a monday to spend our day at universal studio japan and it was a great choice as it wasn t particularly crowded  we did not manage to wake up in time to enter the park at its opening time  but was still able to take all the rides which we had planned to  the highlight of the day would be the harry potter world and the ride  additionally  we did not need to queue for a ticket to enter harry potter world  we had lunch at the three broom sticks which cost us around  35 per person and the portion was pretty filling  however  the queues for the rides were still long  with the harry potter ride queuing for almost 2 hours and the flying dinosaur ride almost 1 5 hours  one thing to note would be that the later it was   the shorter the queue for the rides was  we took the harry potter ride a second time before we left the park and we only had to wait for 5 minutes   there was no queue at all after we left the park  we headed back to shinsaibashi and it was pretty late for dinner already  we then went to the porkless ichiran ramen near the glico sign  even though it was around 2230  there was still a queue for the ichiran ramen  the ramen was cheap and delicious    around  10  it was also our first time eating in an ichiran styled setting  solo cubicle  we enjoyed the ramen and went back to the hotel and call it a day amp x200b day 7  24 december  tuesday fushimi inari shrine  nishiki market  kiyomizu dera temple  yasaka shrine  gion it was christmas eve and we made our first day trip to kyoto  the journey to fushimi inari station took around 1 5 hours and we arrived around 1130   we then walked towards the temple following the huge crowd  before walking to the temple grounds  near there entrance  there was many food stalls selling street food  it took us 2 hours to climb to the top of the mountain   along with breaks in between to take pictures and contemplating to give up or not  the view mid way was better than the view at the top  but hiking up was a good experience nonetheless  it took us another hour before we reached the entrance and we spent more time here than we planned to we then proceeded to nishiki market to look for some lunch along the way  the market was not up to our expectations and was quite smallpared to tsukiji market  the market felt like a long walkway packed with people  the food there did not seem to appeal to us aspared to the other market  however  we tried the soy donut and bought some soy dog biscuits back  tried the octopus egg and some matcha ice cream  we took the train to gion and took a bus heading towards kiyomizu dera temple  the walk to the entrance of the temple was a small hill filled with people at that time  everyone trying to take pictures of the sunset  as the temple was still undergoing renovation and was closing in less than an hour  we decided not to enter and just admired the view from outside we headed down to kyoto station for dinner at sushi no musashi  its one of the better conveyor belt sushi in kyoto and was extremely affordable   15 20 per person  the food tasted to our liking as well  we took a walk around the area and got to view the kyoto tower in night lights  we then headed back to our hotel in osaka amp x200b day 8  25 december  wednesday nara deer park  gion on christmas  we decided to head down to nara using our kansai thru pass and went down to the deer park  the journey took around an hour to get to nara and we went to get some mochi from nakatanidou  but was unable to witness the mochi beating  we bought some donuts from the bakery for breakfast and went to see the deers the deers at the entrance were more aggressive than the ones deeper into the parks and would follow you if they knew you had food  the older deers were also more greedy than the younger ones  but it was still fun to interact with the deers  bowing before them and having photo opportunities  this really was an experience  we spent half a day here  walking from kofuku ji temple to todai ji temple to kaisuga taisha shrine  the only temple we entered was the todai ji temple as it has the big buddha statue inside  kaisuga taisha shrine was also renovating at the point when we went  thus we were unable to enter  the walk around the park surrounded with deers at every point in time was amazing  despite the number of tourists  the place was still beautiful we then headed back to nara station to rest and decided to find a spot for late lunch  the restaurant  tendon makino   served amazing tempura set at a very big portion  there were some variety of fried fishes in the bowl as well  the tempura bowl was really worth the buck  15 20 per person    and was very filling  after the late lunch  we went back to gion as we had some time to spare  by the time we arrived  it was around 1830 and the skies were already dark  we went to the yasaka jinja shrine and took a walk to the kyoto styled starbucks  we spent some time around shijo before having dinner at the yoshinoya around the area  we then returned back to our hotel and ended the tiring day of travelling   amp x200b day 9  26 december  thursday arashiyama bamboo forest  nijo castle we woke up late for this morning and left for arashiyama   the bamboo forest and its surroundings were really beautiful even though it was crowded  the bamboo forest was shorter than we imagined it to be and we only spent less than an hour there  we then decided to head out to the streets to have some of the street foods that were selling outside  including this shop that sold halal fried small bites  we then left for nijo castle and only viewed it from the outside as it did not pique any of our interest to enter  as it started to rain heavily  and i was feeling unwell  we decided to head back to our hotel and rest for a bit  at night  we decided to head down to shinsaibashi and shop around the area  we had our dinner at the porkless ichiran ramen for the second time in our trip as we enjoyed it so much  before going down to the don quijote to buy souvenirs  snacks and food to bring back  we bought lots of stuff from don quijote and headed back to rest for the night amp x200b day 10  27 december  friday cup noodle museum  osaka castle  namba yasaka shrine  abeno haruka 300  shinsekai on our final full day in japan  we started off with cup noodle museum  which was almost a 1 hour travel from shinsaibashi  the cup noodle museum was packed with locals and children and it was a really interesting activity to do there  the diy cup noodle cup was such a fun activity even for us and we thoroughly enjoyed it  after the cup noodle museum  we headed down towards osaka castle park  the walk from the station to the entrance of osaka castle was tedious  we did not enter the castle as we felt like it was not worth the money  we viewed the castle from the outside and left for our next destination as we had some time to spare  we took a detour down to namba yasaka shrine  to view the lion headed shrine  this shrine was at the top of my list due to the the unique shrine head  however the previous few days we were unable to visit as the shrine closes pretty early  the shrine is also very small and when we went  there were a few people just taking pictures with the lion head we proceeded to abeno haruka 300  where we stayed until the sun hadpletely set  the observation deck was interesting and the view of osaka from the skylines were really beautiful  we then left and headed down to shinsekai for our kushikatsu dinner at daruma shinseki  the kushikatsu dinner was inexpensive and the food was good  however we left after just one order as the ambience was not what we expected and the restaurant itself smelled of smoke  we then took a walk around the area and went back to namba when we reached namba  it was pretty late so we decided to spend some time at the arcade  the arcades in japan were way bigger than the ones we have in singapore  and had different variety of games  we decided to head back to shinasaibashi area as it was getting late and managed to grab a melonpan  the melon pan was extremely delicious and a must eat when given the chance to anytime  we then decided to have our last meal at cocoro yakikiniku  shinsaibashi  it was close to midnight  but there was still customers in the restaurant  the food was excellent and tasted well  the meat was relatively cheap  80 90 total  as well and the restaurant owners were very friendly with us after dinner we returned back to the hotel and ended our last night in japan amp x200b day 11  28 december  saturday we checked out from the hotel in the morning and headed towards namba station  where we took the pre purchased train to kansai airport  checked in our luggage at the airport and waited for our flight towards seoul amp x200b what we realised  japanese people were very polite and kind  the workers were also extremely professional in their jobs  many times  where we lost our way or google maps failed us  the train conductors tried their best to help us with the directions  platforms to be at  and how many stops we had to take  google maps was our best friend  using it to navigate through the cities  itineraries are just a rough guide for us and it is okay to miss a place or a train  don t beat yourself too hard over it amp x200b well this took way longer than expected to write and it ended being way longer than what i had expected  hope it helps someone out there ,1
trip report  part 2  lake biwa to kanazawa to takaoka to tokyo  february 2020 ,hi allpart 1 of my trip report can be found here which covers our time at the sapporo snow festival      as some background  we had been to japan a few times and the main purpose was to see the sapporo snow festival and shirakawago light up  so our trip was planned around this lake biwa  biwako    4 days  feb 9 to 12 day 1    we departed on our flight from sapporo to osaka mid morning and made our way to our hotel in otsu  biwako hotel  on the way we picked up our 7 day jr kansai hokuriku area pass which would prove very useful over theing week   we had previously been to osaka and kyoto  so decided to stay somewhere nearby with the aim of seeing a few new things  otsu is a quiet town with the hotels easily walkable from the station  10 mins  there is also a tram that runs through the town which helps when getting to a few of the sights  the station also has a supermarket which is handy to pick up the essentials  the only challenge is the lack of food options in the area  we went to a great omi beef restaurant one night  kadoman  which i would thoroughly rend to anyone in that area  but the other 3 nights we stuck to restaurants at the hotel  so it would be something to consider if you are thinking of staying here instead of kyoto or osaka   day 2    in the morning we headed to daiichi nagisa park rape blossom fields to view the rape blossoms that were in bloom  it was a bit of a trek to get there as we had to catch a train to moriyama station before transferring to an infrequent bus  the blossoms itself were really nice but probably not worth the challenge getting there as a lot of time was spent waiting for buses  after that we went to  omi hachiman which was a great  we enjoyed going up the ropeway and then strolling around the canals  we also stumbled across a nice place that served sweet rice balls and rice tea which wasforting given the cold weather day 3    in the morning we headed off to uji with our first stop being nakamura t kichi  we arrived just before opening and didn t expect there to be a queue already  the tea  soba and desserts here were great  we actually went to the one in ginza later in our trip which was just as nice  we slowly made our way to byodoin temple before walking back to the station  uji is a great town just to walk around  it s verypact with lots of places selling matcha treats and a few neat shops  after uji we made our way to nara for a late lunch and quick visit to see the deers  we had previously been to nara but went again so our daughter could see the deers   day 4    we decided to do a day trip to osaka to do a bit of shopping  we also strolled around osaka castle which i hadn t previously been to and enjoyed the plum blossoms that were starting to bloom morning of departure    before heading to kanazawa we took the tram from otsu to ishiyama dera temple  it was a really nice temple and very peaceful in the morning  i think we only saw 5 or so other walking around when we were there  so definitely worth checking out for anyone in the area  after that we hopped on our train to kanazawa   kanazawa   3 days  feb 13 to 15 day 1    we arrived in kanazawa around lunchtime and spent the rest of they day strolling around the town  we had previously stayed in kanazawa so we enjoyed just being able to walk around higashi chaya  the castle and surrounding areas without feeling the need to visit every shop or attraction  all 3 nights we were there we had dinner at a different izakaya  with the highlight being fuwari  the last time we were in kanazawa ended up eating near the station most nights  but this time we found that there were a lot of great modern izakaya s which served up some really nice dished  it definitely makes we want toe back just for the food  we also found that at the place we went to there wasn t much smoking  but maybe we just got lucky day 2    we didn t really have any firm plans for day 2 and 3  so just kinda did what we felt like  on day 2 we decided to go to gokayama for a visit and hopefully see some snow  we knew it was a warmer winter and were hopeful there was snow given we were going to shirakawago in a few days  the trip to gokayama was pleasant  we took the shinkansen to tokaoka before switching to their local train for johana which was decked out in anime pictures  we then hopped on the bus to gokayama  it was a bit of a journey but when you aren t in a rush it can be quite enjoyable  gokayama was a pleasant visit  there was still some snow on the rooftops and ground but we could see that it was starting to melt as we frequently saw large chunks falling off rooftops  we walked up to the viewing platform which was a bit tricky with the icy ground but was definitely worth it  back in kanazawa we visited kenrokuen at night for their free winter light up  there wasn t any snow but it was still really nice seeing the garden illuminated  maybe it was good that it was a bit warmer as we were able to walk around and explore for an hour or so without feeling the need to go back to our hotel   day 3    again  no real plans so we just walked went to the markets  went to the shops for a bit   we spent a lot of time at the ishikawa local products center where they have a number of craft workshops  we probably did around 4 or 5 different things here and it turned out to be quite enjoyable and we have a few souvenirs to bring home   takaoka   1 day  feb 16 one of the reasons for our trip was to go to the shirakawago winter light up  we had this booked in for the evening of february 16 with our bus departing from takaoka  so we departed kanazawa and made the short trip to takaoka  it was raining so we found that we couldn t really do too much walking when we got there so mainly stuck around the station  we spent our time focused on doraemon  checking out the statues  sending some doraemon postcards from the doraemon post box and also taking a short trip on the doraemon themed tram  it was fairly enjoyable but we found that the station area was really quiet with not many food options  perhaps if the weather was nicer we could have explored a bit more but the main purpose was going to shirakawago  so at around 3pm we hopped on our bus knowing the weather wasn t great  we arrived at shirakawago and were greeted by lots of rain and no snow  it was kinda expected but at the same time disappointing  but who can control the weather  i consider myself lucky that we managed to go to gokayama a couple of days prior and was able to see the snow covered houses as there wasn t really much to see at shirakawago that night  the one thing i didn t know before booking was that there are set times to go up to the viewing platform  so once we arrived in shirakawago we were almost immediately guided to the bus stop as we awaited our bus to the viewing platform  once there we had to wait around an hour in the rain before the light upenced  but even then it wasn tpletely dark  given the rain it wasn t worth waiting any longer so decided to just spend the time walking around and eating some snack  overall it was a disappointing and wet night  maybe one day i ll make the trip back here or maybe not the following morning we were greeted by sunshine  before heading to tokyo we decided to take a walk to check out the bhuddha which was neat  there were a lot of closed shops along the way as we went before takaoka had woken up  so it would be neat toe back again on a nice day and see the city when it is alive  overall we enjoyed our time in the ishikawa and toyama prefectures and i would love toe back when it s warmer and hire a car and drive around  i feel like there is so much to see but it can be tricky if you are limited to trains and buses   tokyo   9 days  feb 17 to feb 25 i won t go into too much detail as we had been to tokyo a few times so we spent our time revisiting things we loved while checking out a couple of new things  a few highlights included  checking out the plum blossoms that were in bloom and enjoying the festivities  yushima tenjin was probably the pick  we went on the weekend and they had live music and lot of treats to eat including some plum blossom mochi  i always love it when the festivals are on    spotting some early blooming cherry blossoms near fureaibashi bridge  going back to disneyland and disneysea   always a lot of fun  checking out teamlabs borderless for the first time and gettingpletely lost  going to gomaya kuki around 5 times for

for the dates i am planning  early to mid march  i ve been to tokyo before with a friend  but this time i m going solo  trying to do some things i really enjoyed last time   some new things that we didn t get to please let me know if some days seem too packed or not packed enough  i d love some help as this is my first time going overseas alone  and therefore first time planning something like this alone  also if certain things would fit better with others  that would be helpful too  thank you so much for taking the time to look and help  i appreciate it so much  day 1  simple stuff  i m flying into haneda instead of narita this time  have to figure out stuff with pocket wifi   sim cards still  i didn t plan any of that during last trip  i remember having a pocket wifi but my friend handled it  any help there would be appreciated  i have an iphone 11 max with verizon if that helps with any information you could give  planning to stay at kimi ryokan in ikebukuro because i literally just need a  clean  bed and a  clean  shower to be happy   so basically just check in and wander around ikebukuro a little bit  grab dinnewatesnacks etc  day 2  shibuya   harajuku  small repeat of my last trip  we stayed in shibuya  loft  tokyu hands  donki  never went into the 109 building so i am curious  small snack from the food show in the tokyu department store  my friend and i loved it there last time  shibuya parco  nintendo tokyo  harajuku  takeshita street  exploring   maybe snake cafe  will double check to see if they treat the animals properly  meiji shrine  not a huge priority because i ve already been but i loved it so so much   and i believe it was under construction while i visited day 3 akihabara   asakusa  radio kaiken  arcades  anime shops  gacha  kakimori stationery  mt lab  asakusa shrine  senso ji  nishi sando  tokyo solamachi  kameido tenjin shrine  tokyo skytree  i know it s not worth it to everybody to actually go up it but  i am so curious  when i first saw it i was in awe at how huge it is  couldn t stop looking at it from the window of the narita express lmao  day 4 ginza   tsukiji   pokemon cafe  pokemon cafe  small snack  amp  a coffee  want to eat at tsukiji mostly  plus i remember it being quite pricey  wander around the nihonboshi area a little bit  itoya ginza  if you can t tell by now i am a huge stationery lover  ginza six  tsukiji fish market  back to ikebukuro for wandering  maybe do sunshine mall or seibu if i still want to shop  otherwise some outside stuff day 5 tokyo tower   roppongi   akasaka  tokyo tower  zozoji temple  shiba park   roppongi hills  will do mall  museum  and observation deck  hie shrine  nogi shrineday 6 shinjuku   shimokitazawa  seikaido  art stationery shop  kabuchiko  day time  just want to wander   not really into bars    samurai museum  grab food in the area  not sure how long shimokitazawa would take  or if it s worth it for me to go  i m typically a size xl here in the states so i assume most of the clothes wouldn t fit me  but i love love love shoes boots and random trinkets so i could definitely still have fun i think  day 7 ikebukuro   ueno  explore ikebukuro a bit more if i haven t already at this point   grab breakfast lunch  maybe visit the animate store  stuff like that  ueno park  toshoju shrine  nezu shrine  loved it there last time  was basically empty  possibly visit a museum or two  maybe the art museum or national museum  day 8 9  would love love some cool suggestions for these days  maybe cool things i ve missed or things that you loved  some things i did last time but don t need to do again are  sanrio puro land  teamlab borderless  ghibli museum   amp  the imperial gardens  i loved visiting shrines so if there are any that i ve missed that you enjoyed  i would love to know also debating filling one of these days with a day trip to kawaguchiko or hakone  quick trip  not overnight  the 2 hour trip doesn t bother me  did a trip to kawaguchiko last time but sadly no fuji visibility  we wanted to try even if the chance was slim  i know visibility still isn t perfect in march but definitely better than late june  fuji trip is a maybe  for now possibly thinking of going to a baseball game at tokyo dome if they re playing   walking around the la qua shopping plaza  was a total downpour when i was in the area last time  day 10 re doing any favorite things before leaving  definitely another trip to a loft  maybe visit some record shops  amp  stuff as well  last minute arcade fun because i m addicted to crane games  gift hunting for friends  amp  family  etc  probably won t be in tokyo again for a while  especially because i really want to do osaka and kyoto soon day 11 going home  probably will get to the airport super duper early because i am paranoid so won t have time to do much this day   thank you so much if you got this far  as you can tell  quarantine has me bored with nothing else to think about  also  would appreciate any katsudon  pork bun  and or omurice rendations       edit  thank you to everybody that s suggested helped me out  definitely going to spend some time looking at places that are about 1 2 hours out from tokyo by train bus  so far  loving kamakura and nikko so those will definitely make their way in there  thank you everybody  you guys are such a sweetunity edit 2  thank you again  going through everything now and going to revise my lil itinerary  will probably post again when it s perfected    0  ,1

itinerary for a 19 day trip  osaka  kyoto  shimanami kaido  tokyo ,hello  my brother and i have a trip booked for august 30   september 18  we have not planned anything in too much depth yet  but i am seeing if our itinerary so far is good we are open to pretty much anything  so if you have suggestions feel free to throw them my way amp x200b  8 30   8 31 arrive at kix around 6 45  make our way to our hostel  get food  sleep  9 1   9 3 as far as osaka goes we would like to go to universal  osaka aquarium  osaka castle  and den den town  we are open to staying longer in osaka if there are plenty more things to do  9 4 9 5 take the train to kyoto  visit fushimi inari  monkey park  bamboo forest  i have been to kyoto  but my brother hasn t  so we are just going to do the basic kyoto stuff  9 6   9 7 take the train to onomichi and start the shimanami kaido  we plan on doing the whole ride in two days  but may be open to doing it in one day if that is a better option  my main concern is where we will leave our luggage  are there big lockers in onomichi station to put our luggage until we get back  9 8 take the shinkansen to tokyo  then rest since we will be wiped out from cycling  9 9   9 18 we don t want to necessarily plan out tokyo too much  in a nutshell  we will probably spend entire days in one district  or maybe two  we will probably go to akihabara more than once though since we are into all that stuff  the last few days will probably be full shopping days should we spend more time in osaka kyoto  should we plan out tokyo more in depth rather than just do whatever  let me know your thoughts ,1
trip report  sapporo snow festival 2020,hi alli was fortunate enough to go to the sapporo snow festival this year along with a quick trip to otaru for their snow light path festival  we were in sapporo from february 3 to 9 and traveled with a toddler planning try and book as early as possible  we booked our hotel around 7 8 months in advance and found that a lot of options were booked out  after booked the prices of hotels just went up  so best to plan ahead  if you can  try and go towards the end of the snow festival as it overlaps with the festivals at otaru and asahikawa  also there are snow sculpturepetitions that don t begin until the start of the festival so you only see thepleted sculpture towards the end weather  amp  clothing ing from australia it was cold  but apparently not as cold as previous years  weather was usually around  5 to 0  with otaru being slightly colder  wearing layers  waterproof water resistant boots and wind resistant clothing was essential  if you are unable to buy this before you leave then you can easily pick up clothing from uniqlo and shoes from abc mart  and probably a bunch of other stores  also  if you are travelling with a toddler then bring a carrier  using a strollepram in the snow isn t an option  it will also keep you warm having them close to your chest sapporo snow festival the snow festival is split into 3 sites with 1 unofficial site as well  odori site   this is the main site with all the snow sculptures  it covers around 12 blocks with around a third accessible from the underground walkways  it takes around 3 or so hours to see all of it  there are plenty of food stalls  shops  events and photo spots along with way so you can easily spend a lot longer there if you take your time  we found it was too cold to see it all at once so would often take break to go inside or underground to warm up  we also went back at night to see part of it as you get apletely different vibe  we also went up the tv tower at night for views of the entire event which was worth it  susukino site   this site is focused on ice sculptures  we went at night and it took us around 1 2 hours to see it all  it was great seeing it at night as the sculptures are lit up  there are also a couple of photo spots along the way  tsudome site   this site is a shortish bus ride from sapporo  around 20 mins and features a number of snow activities  there were slides  tubing  mazes etc  there is also an indoor area with some food stalls and other activities  we were there for a few hours in the morning and found it fairly quiet  if you aren t interested in the activities then you can probably skip this  but if you are you could spend most of the day there  nakajima park   this isn t part of the official festival  but from february 7 to 9 they had a light up event at night  there are a couple of sculptures at the entrance but the main focus is on the candles and lights scattered around the park  it was really nice to walk around and explore for a couple of hours and i would definitely rend going to it otaru snow light path festival on february 8 we did a day trip to otaru to see the snow light path festival  this was the eve of the festival  with it officially beginning on february 9  however they did have a launch event on the 8th  this involved some music and a few speeches to kick off the festival  the main snow path was lit up but we found it really crowded   moreso than what we experience at sapporo  it was still enjoyable but i would rend going another night if you can other attractions this wasn t our first trip to sapporo so when we had free time it was focused on shopping  eating and kid friendly activities  a few activities we enjoyed were  sapporo beer factory for a quick self tour and eating genghis khan in the beer hall  sapporo science centre is great of kids and if you want a break from the cold  it was pretty quiet and had a lot of interactive displays  they were in japanese but were interactive enough that it was enjoyable for us  otaru aquarium was ok for a short visit  it is pretty small but has a couple of shows such as a penguin walk  we had previously gone to the zoo in asahikawa which is much better but if it s too far and you want to see the penguins then otaru is a decent option also  asahikawa has a snow festival on at the same time  we didn t end up going but something to consider  on previous trips to sapporo we enjoyed the mt  okura ski jump stadium and the shiroi koibito park factory tour food some of our favourite foods while there were  soup curry   we had this most nights and tried a few different places  they all have slightly different soup bases and toppings so it was fun to try a few places  it s great with the cold weather and a must try while there  genghis khan   we enjoyed having this at the sapporo beer factory but there are a few other places you can go for it  seafood   there are a lot of seafood options while in sapporo and otaru  we had dinner at sapporo kani honke and really enjoyed it  otaru also have a lot of seafood restaurants as well  kinotoya   they have the best hokkaido cheese tarts and we ate way too many of them  they also have great soft serve ice cream  le tao   they make a great cheese cake and lot of other desserts  they have a couple of cafes in otaru but you can easily do take away in sapporo from one of the department stores after sapporo we headed to lake biwa  kanazawa  takaoka and tokyo  if i have time i ll do a write up of this in theing weeks hope you all enjoyed the read and happy to answer any questions ,1
anyone know how to access kazamaura shimofuro ,i ll  hopefully  be traveling to japan in january 2021 with my friend  who speaks japanese  and we were interested in checking out this little town for their monkfish festival  however i can t find a route there  because it appears that there isn t a train station in that town  any help would be greatly appreciated ,1
rendations for travelers who do speak japanese ,hi japantravelers my husband and i are hoping to travel to japan this december for two weeks  if covid 19 allows for it  fingers crossed  i m thrilled because i actually had the opportunity to live in and travel throughout japan pretty extensively when i was younger  high school early college  but haven t been back in about ten years  i never took the jlpt  but looking at the level guidelines  i was probably between n2 and n3  i have kept up my language to some degree  and plan to dive deep into speaking listeningprehension in the next few months  my husband doesn t speak japanese and has never traveled there  but is super excited and down for everything my question  is there anywhere in japan  or any experience  that you d only really rend to people who arefortable reading speaking some level of japanese the reason i ask  in terms of itinerary  i m sort of puzzled  i have been to pretty much all of the  must see  places  including a lot of the top winter destinations  sapporo s yuki matsuri  the sea of okhotsk  shirakawago  hida takayama  the jigokudani monkey hot springs in nagano  other than a trip to fukushima to see my host families  there s nowhere in particular i want to go  i just want to be back in the land of onsen and conbini while i definitely want my husband to see some of the big tourist destinations  i m curious to know if there s anything  off the beaten path  i won t find looking through typical itinerary ideas because it might be hard for non japanese speakers to navigate  i know that japan is so magical we ll have an adventure regardless of where we go  so i wanted to see if reddit had some ideas i haven t considered yet  as an example  i ve considered focusing the trip on tohoku northern japan  since i know that would be a very unique  and not super touristy  experience thanks in advance possibly helpful background info  we re into the outdoors and do like winter sports  but don t really want to make that a focus  we re much more interested in cultural activities like visiting hot springs  festivals  temples shrines museums  eating a ton  etc  we ll probably be in japan through christmas until right up to the new year  places i haven t been would love to go are hiroshima  okinawa  and the mt  fuji area  but we may need to save those for a visit during another season  not winter edit1  sapporo ,1
trip report  9 days in tokyo dec 16   dec 25,while i know this is a very tardy trip report  i feel like we need a bit of content and distraction from the fact that many people are having to change their plans due to this troubling time you can find my itinerary i posted before the trip  here first off  let me say that this trip was about proposing to my girlfriend and as a way to celebrate her graduation from college  i am pleased to share she did say yes  thank god  what an awkward twelve hour flight that would have been  secondly  thank god we went when we did any later and we would have been in creeping into corona time  although the first cases weren t confirmed til much later   the flights to california let me preface this with the fact that i am not a stranger to flying  but how woefully under prepared i was for the monster that was los angeles to haneda  first was a flight from orlando to dallas fort worth  after the flight we had a brisk jog to our next flight  then was the flight from dallas to los angeles  these short flights were nothing stellar  watched a movie  had noisy kids  the standard  the moment things got interesting was navigating lax  we had to exit security  just to re enter it to get to our gate  we just got to the front of the line for our passport when our plane began boarding  we arrived at the gate  and our plane just began seating the economy seating  we were sitting in the very back rows of the plane so i took this chance to try and squeeze money exchange in before we got called  i jogged all the way back up the terminal  and started the process  luckily no one was in front of me  at the very end she asks for my driver s license  which is all the way back with my girlfriend at the end of the terminal  after a brisker jog back to retrieve my wallet  i briskest jog back to the exchange counter to finally get my wad of cash  upon returning to where i left my girlfriend  she is no where to be seen  and our luggage isn t there  panic sets in  turns out the check in counter needed to confirm our tickets for some reason and she was at the front desk  after all of that we are some of the last people on the plane  and i ve worked up a sweat  sorry fellow passengers all the flights were one booking  so these close calls were not supposed to even happened the great trans pacific flight as i said before  i am not new to flying  but this was my first flight across the ocean  and easily my first flight of this length  the second longest flight is only a measly five hours  after getting settled from the running that felt like a marathon  despite me running cross country in high school  we quickly became enraptured by the seemingly royal amenities  even though we were in the cheapest seats on the plane we were enamored  in flight entertainment that takes longer to scroll through than the flights i took to get this far  games of seemingly unlicensed quality  rather roomy seats and top notch tables  i felt like i was in the lap of luxury  fast forward six hours and i wanted to be anywhere but on that damned plane  a screen showing our currently location  with an agonizingly slow plane soaring across the bearing sea  aching back with no relief  that list of once thought endless entertainment now a monument of disinterest and indecision  the cherry on top was i had been awake for the solid twenty hours to this point  in my foolish attempt to laugh in the face of kronos and conquer jet lag  i had decided to not sleep on the flight  luckily  my girlfriend beside me had no such illusions of grandeur  and was managing to get some escape from my anxiety filled presence  the turmoil replaced by giddy excitement as we looked out the window and saw salvation  twinkling in the distance little golden lights  the surface was in view  upon landing we were freed from the prison tube  and we were once again powered by our own lotion brave new world we were here  we had made it  after exiting the plane we quickly made it to customs  after a quick scan of our documents  we were immediately ejected into the baggage claim  very convenient  while waiting for our luggage we were greeted by a worried airport employee with an ipad asking if we were  my last name  after we confirmed  she began to say that our luggage may not be here  and they may have to ship it to our hotel when it arrives  she is apologetic and doing her best to explain in english  we arepletely unfazed  and explain to her it is okay  we ask her if two of the four bags we brought had arrived  she said yes  and we told here then there is nothing to worry about  in preparation for the trip we placed a medium sized bag in our large checked bag so that we would have room for souvenirs and so we didn t have to surgically repack our bags on the way back  she had a hard time understanding this  as we had four bags assigned  that bit is our fault  we were unsure if we said we only had two bags when we departed we wouldn t be able to chose four bags when we returned  so when we left orlando we chose four bags and put the tags on the bags inside our larger bags  dumb in hindsight  but we were stressed and uncertain  after our bags came around  we promptly opened them up to reveal the missing bags  relief washed over our friends face and we were off to enjoy our trip   metal tube prison 2  electric boogaloo after acquiring our sim and pasmo cards  we made our way to the train  at this time we learned that my suitcase wheels had taken quite the impact during the three flights  because they melted under the constant impacts of the tile floors  i forget the time we finally arrived to get on the train but it must have been rush hour because there was barely enough room for all of the airport passengers to fit in the cabin  at least that is what i thought  i was aware of the famous white gloved people pushers  and was prepared for the worst  but luckily the worst never came  instead  more and more people piled on the train at every stop  pushing my girlfriend and i further back with our unwieldy luggage  never to the point were the mythical white gloves were necessary  but definitely tighter than we would have liked  after an eternity and a half in a hot tube filled with meat  we arrived at our stop  asakusa station  foolishly we then hauled our luggage through the station  down stairs  up stairs  down stairs  and then back up  instead of just finding the elevator  after a short walk in the refreshingly cold air we arrived at our  hotel  after a much needed shower and bath we went to sleep hoping to never endure that level of inconvenience again day 1  asakusa this day consisted of no trains  the very thought of one at this point would bring cold sweats  because of proximity of our hotel to the day s activities  we knew that if we missed stuff today due to jet lag and fatigue we could squeeze things in to any other day  fortunately my wager paid off  and not an ounce of jet lag was had  we toured the shops  the food stands  the streets  every bit of it was interesting  fried chicken from a vendor stall tasted like guy fieri himself took me on a personal trip to flavor town  we visited the senso ji temple and the asakusa shrine  the main nakamise street was very touristy and a bit of a let down  but i was glad i saw it and partook in the experience  two of the best activities of the day was goldfish scooping at  asakusa kingyo  and having extremely matcha ice cream at  suzukien asakusa day 2  meiji trains are back  but we are scheduling all rides to be during slow times  a quick hop to harajuku  and after a short walk to the  meiji shrine  we are transported to forest within a city  this beautiful walk is a must for anyone interested in japan s shrines or temples  truly unique  after our walk through the temple we stop by yoyogi park to take a break  then we were off to takeshita street  after very little shopping  mostly just there for the spectacle  we head to an okonomiyaki restaurant for lunch   yai yai  is a very english friendly restaurant  with a very friendly owner  all smiles  and wonderful atmosphere will have meing back if i ever find myself in the neighborhood again day 3  ghibli museum   tokyo tower  and proposal the big day is here  and possibly the greatest source of pre trip stress  getting tickets to the museum for our desired time was an ordeal  we almost didn t get the tickets at all  the uing proposal made every moment a mix of sheer panic and delight  after a wonderful morning at the museum  even with a nasty fall onto her butt made by my soon to be fiancee  we made it to our destination for lunch   the happy pancake  was a tucked away  third floor nook  where we had our super fluffy japanese pancake experience  from there we wandered around kichijoji  and then headed back to tokyo  for our anticipated trip up the tower  before our reserved time slot in the tower  we explored  zojoji temple  a beautiful grounds just off the base of the tower  when our time finally came we made our way to the tower  wandered the shops  rested a bit  then went of to the top observation deck  i definitely rend this to anyone looking for a unique  and intimate way to view tokyo  only a handful of people are allowed up on the top deck at a time  and you still get access the the main deck on the way down  the proposal was a success  i was so nervous  i just snuck the ring out of my pocket and quietly drew her attention to it  tears we shed  hugs were exchanged  and quick kisses were shared as to not upset the others around  i would actually be surprised if anyone present were even aware of the proposal at all day 4  ueno i ll start this off by saying this  i did go to the  ueno zoo  while there were many things they could do better  there were many enclosures that were just fine  if you have a bleeding heart for animals or have a general disdain for the concepts of zoos altogether  avoid this zoo  now that we are past the controversial topic  the  tokyo national museum  was amazing  a super cheap price for three amazing museums was so worth the time we spent inside them  there was a festival we were unaware of in the park outside the museum  and it was amazing  food  handmade crafts  and a stage with people showcasing their talents  the  ameyoko  market was an interesting experience and definitely worth a walk through if you find yourself nearby day 5  shinjuku garden and tokyo metropolitan building the  garden  even in winter was a treat  the tea houses and greenhouse was a wonderful sight  afterwards we made our way to the  tokyo metropolitan building  a short elevator ride later and we were treated to a spectacular view  a lovely live piano performance  and a small cafe  at the time the olympic preparations were in full swing and i took a picture of the olympic stadium  later i would find out the picture i took would technically have usain bolt in it  even if he isn t visible  after more shopping and stopping by to see the iconic hachiko statue  we made the great crossing of the shibuya scramble day 6  akihabara the great pilgrimage wasplete  we had made it to weeb town  jpn  my fiancee and i do partake in many animated forms of entertainment  and read manga  but we had never been overt with our interests  we mainly came here because we felt obligated  and to pick up some merchandise we couldn t in the states  or at least not for a reasonable price  we also made a trip to the local shrine before all the stores opened  we intended to visit tokyo station after akihabara  but unfortunately we were short on time  and had to bypass it if we wanted to attend a winter solstice festival that night pletely packed and crowded  we made our offerings and bought our charms  partook in the food and found ourselves back on the street before we could even process what had happened  it was magical   day 7  spa day this day was all about getting off our feet  and getting away from the city  we canceled the previous plans to go to the small amusement park next to it in favor of spending a half day at asakusa to find souviners  buy new suitcases  and explore stuff we missed on the first day  after a train ride that was mostly empty  and one we spent the whole time sitting  we found ourselves at  toshimaen niwa no yu  this resort is not tattoo friendly  but you can wear your own bathing suit in the multitude of mixed bathing pools and saunas  this resort also had sleeping rooms  a wonderful restaurant  that we ate at twice  several massage options  and separated traditional baths  after a much needed break we returned back to our hotel   day 8  tsukiji and odiaba the outer tsukiji market is still alive and buzzing  the markets were alive with fresh fish  busy isles  and quality goods  if you were thinking of skipping tsukiji because the main market closed  don t  this should still be on your radar if you were interested before  and should still be rended if you are giving travel advice  odiaba  not much to say other than its like six large american malls back to back with japans own flair thrown in  a must if trendy clothes are your thing  and not all the clothes are extra small  but most of them are still going to tend to lean that way   teamlab borderless  was an unforgettable experience  if you need a new profile picture  just about every wall will be the perfect back drop  unfortunately  this is what its kinda known for  good photographs  don t get me wrong   i got my fair share of pictures too  but some people will stand for minutes on end trying to get the perfect shot for their social media  and you will get bumped by someone face down in their phone day 9  there and back again while this day did not really include an activity  itbined with the hours we spent arriving does technically add up to a ninth day  instead of getting on the train for an hour ride back to the airport  we opted for a taxi ride  for anyone who has traveled by taxi in tokyo  you know where this is going  a taxi ride from asakusa to haneda  while short by car  quickly racked up a one hundred dollar fare  was this worth not having to get crushed into an hour long train ride with luggage  maybe  was it worth my new fiancee being happy  yes so  what did we learn walk less  sit more don t get swept with the crowd always have a back up plan for food  70  of my restaurants fell through find the elevator don t be afraid to try to talk to people take  calculated  risks  every plan that fell through turned into an amazing impromptu experience conclusion this has been a wonderful experience  this report did not include about 50  of what i did in each place  so if you wanted to know about stuff near where i went  ill let you know if i did it  and how it was  i ll answer any questions you may have  thank you foring to my ted talk ,1

private onsen ryokan with view of fuji,hi everyone  my boyfriend and i were meant to be visiting japan this april  however we ve had to reschedule to next year which has given us the chance to replan our trip  we were previously going to visit yumenoi onsen and loved how traditional it was after seeing it in a youtube video  however  we would really love to stay near fuji this time and want somewhere equally as traditional with a beautiful view and a private onsen  any rendations of ryokans that offer a full dining private experience with an amazing view of the mountain from the room would be so appreciated ,1
questions about a fall 2021 mini traverse,edit   i know it will be a grueling pace  but i did france  gt  southern germany germany  gt  austria  gt  cr  gt  northern germany  gt  amsterdam in 2 weeks and 10 western us states in 3 weeks  we re seasoned travelers  my mo is usually to go very broad on my first trip and then dig into the things i wanted to see more of when ie back amp x200b it would not be quite a grand traverse but the current sketch is a 3 week trip hitting  hokkaido  asahikawa  daisetsuzan  sapporo  hakodate  tohoku  ichinoseki  mitsushima  sendai  tokyo and hakone  kyoto  osaka  kobe  okinawa amp x200b my questions 1  does haneda  or the various luggage porter services  offer long term  1 week  luggage storage  ideally we would have 2 sets of baggage  a northern one for hokkaido and a southern one for tokyo  kyoto  and okinawa2  would it be worth it to spend more time on hokkaido  specifically to go to shiretoko  if we did that we d have to nix okinawa and probably shorten the tokyo and kyoto segments3  do japanese rental agencies allow you to pick up a car somewhere and drop it off somewhere else  could we pick up in asahikawa and drop off in sapporo or hakodate 4  for those who have done hokkaido in the fall  how cold is it  when were were in yellowstone in september last year it snowed several inches and got into the  10 cs   it seems like daisetsuzan has a somewhat similar climate   i was thinking maybe starting the trip on sep 10th or so  to get to daisetsuzan before the roads close 5  for people that have been to sendai  tohoku region  do you think it is worthwhile  there s something that appeals to me about the train trip from hakodate to tokyo  plus i want to see geibikei gorge and mitsushima bay  but doing so adds 3 days vs just flying back to tokyo out of asahikawa6  referencing question  3  is it true you can t see much of the country from the shinkansen  so maybe a lot of that time on the train through tohoku would be pretty lame 7  how is nikko for the wilderness lover once you get past the major shrines  if we really wanted to get out and hike and enjoy nature  is spending several days in nikko a good bet and just skipping hokkaido altogether 8  i would like to visit a traditional ryokan in some of the less touristy areas  but my partner has a tattoo  will that be a bigger problem outside of where the tourists usually hit ,1
trip report  3 day and 4 nights in tokyo  jan 10 14  2020,it s hard to believe it s been four months since i  23 m  first stepped foot in tokyo  and it wasn t even a possibility until a few weeks before i visited  thanks to a unique work and traveling situation that i happened to be in and a little help from my parents  i was able to spend time in tokyo on a modest budget pre planning navigation  it would have been impossible to get around tokyo if it weren t for the existence of google maps  i cannot begin to tell you how difficult it would be to get around with a physical map  for one  even though signs use the latin alphabet and kanji  it isn t like this everywhere  not to mention the fact that dealing with dozens of subway lines  hundreds of neighborhoods and many other obstacles for a tourist would be a total waste of time  i say this because quite a bit of my time was spent trying to figure out where i was and where i wanted to go  the subway exit guidance was also a godsend  as someone in a thread pointed out last week  and it was a seamless experience transit  i initially had a  wee suica  card but later got the traditional green one as a souvenir  again  google maps was my personal transit guide and i can t rend anything else  not even apple maps which i m fond of equipment  all i brought was my backpack and a toiletry bag  and there is a reason for this which i will get into below  i also had my dslr and two usb battery packs for my power guzzling iphone se  forunication i bought a wifi hotspot at narita for  3 day my research was done through this sub   tokyo s  uncharted tokyo  an invaluable book created by the collaboration of redditors  japan guide  many other random websites on random topics  and in particular   paolo from tokyo  on youtube  his videos sped up my planning and gave my good ideas  also  i had coworkers who had recently solo travelled to japan and gave me advice on things to do  which led me to book a half day tour of the city background unlike most people  i didn t have a 14 hour flight in  i happened to be working on the island of saipan  120 miles north of guam  and 3 hours southeast of japan  saipan used to be controlled by japan before world war ii  but was lost when the us won it back a few months before my trip  if i were on the island then  i d have to fly united down to guam and then into japan  but in november  a domestic japanese airline called skymark began service in a bid to  bring back tourism to the island  as a side effect  those on island who wanted to do the reverse could do it  and i know several locals who said they couldn t wait to go north and visit tokyo  but then the virus came along i wasn t in the best financial position while on island  i wanted to go to japan so bad  every day i would check skymark s page to see if flight prices would drop  they were steady at around  400 round trip  for most people here that would be a drop in the bucket  i had to wait eventually i gave up searching  a few days later  out of curiosity  i checked again   90 one way   280 round trip  i could make that work  being that it was also the holiday season and i was over 7000 miles away from home  my parents helped a little bit and sent  500 to me for the of my expenses friday  january 10th  saipan  gt  narita shinjuku afternoon who thought a domestic airline could be this good  skymark gave me a blanket  mug and nice meal  consisting of some saipan delicacies    i m 99  sure i was the only non japanese person onboard  because i went through narita customs alone  i then claimed my pocket wifi  struggled to get the  40 jr narita express discount and then rode to shinjuku evening after wading through throngs ofuters at shinjuku station  i emerged  as planned  to the main strip in the area  absolutely breathtaking  after visiting a 7 11  i got to my hostel  unplan shinjuku  around 10 that night  right before the sign in cutoff  and to my surprise  they had a free to use smartphone next to my bed  with data  if i had known this before i bought the pocket wifi at  35 night  the hostel was amazing and modern  having opened a few months earlier  the bathrooms were clean  the dorm area was relatively quiet  and the staff were helpful when needed  the only things i didn t like were the location  about 10 minutes walk outside of the center of shinjuku  and the light they left on one night  i would stay here again though if given the option saturday  january 11th  tsukiji market  bus tour  shibuya  shinjuku morning i got up early to visit tsukiji outer market  since i had a bus tour at 9  i got there around 7 30 and cut my time short at the market to about an hour  i was overwhelmed by the food options  but settled on some  salmon onigiri and seared tuna skewers  this was also my only time seeing ginza i took the subway up to hamamatsucho bus terminal  where i almost missed my tour thanks to being lost  it was a great half day tour where we first went to meiji shrine  then the imperial palace grounds  only open certain days  and then asakusa  where i left the tour to explore more of that area after ramen for lunch  i took a train to tokyo station  got a bento box  and headed back to my hostel because i needed to rest with the miles i put on throughout the day evening after laying down for a bit  i headed out to shibuya to check out shibuya scramble square  a new shoppingplex that had recently opened  it has a depachika in the basement and about a dozen floors of shops  so many of these buildings felt like escalator jungle gyms  i mostly did window shopping here  because i came to get a view of tokyo from the sky deck    walked around kabukicho and golden gai  and went to bed sunday  january 12th  shinjuku gyoen  shibuya  roppongi hills morning what was hard to adjust to was the fact that everything opens late and closes early in japan for the most part  so i couldn t do everything i wanted  but may not have had the energy to do it all anyways  i spent the morning in shinjuku gyoen  about a 10 minute walk from my hostel  and stumbled upon a nice indoor botanical garden i got on the yamanote line for a short ride to shibuya station  it was pretty cool to see so many people crossing that intersection at one time afternoon i spent over an hour waiting to get into line at  katsu midori  seibu  a well known conveyor belt sushi restaurant in tokyo  this is one of those rare times that i think waiting in line was worth my time  because not only was the food cheap  it was also fresh and the atmosphere was inviting  this was one of those rendations from paolo that i had to do later  i visited a place around the corner called  milk  which has good ice cream and crepes i then did some hopping around to tokyu hands  don quijote and a few other places to get soveniers and window shop  on a side note  i wonder why the u s  doesn t have its tokyo hands equivalent  that place was amazing evening again  i found myself gassed  so i went back to the hostel to recover  i m not even out of shape  it s just that you can only do so much walking without resting that you ll feel you have to sit down  this bined with some rain and a lack of cash on hand at the time  iirc  made me go back around 7 00 i went down to roppongi hills  another place i had been wanting to visit  hindsight is 20 20  and i would have gone to harajuku or akihabara instead  if i could grasp how limited my time would be on the trip  but this was an alright place  another escalator jungle gym with plenty of stores and ways to get lost  maybe it would ve made more sense if i had more time  but it didn t seem like it was worth the visit  to add to this  most places i wanted to visit has closed by 9 00  i did manage to get  pretty good tasting tsukamen monday  january 13th  mount takao  tokyo skytree  akihabara morning unplan shinjuku has a decent selection of breakfast items  such as bread and toast  greek yogurt with peaches  and hard boiled eggs  it was enough for me i took several trains out to hachioji  home to to mount takao  it s about an hour away from shinjuku and a good excursion for those who want to hike or see mount fuji without going to it  here  you can ride a chairlift to about 1 3 of the way up  where you follow the path to the summit  it s not a trail per se  it feels more like a city park with its temples  shrines and shops along the way  so you don t feel isolated  i tried dango here  which was worth it  and had soba noodles at a restaurant just past the summit  on a clear day  you can see mount fuji  and i was able to that day a bit further down are hiking trails that extend hundreds of miles to the southwest  i went on one for a few hundred feet but then headed back to the base of the mountain also of noteworthy mention is takao 599 museum  which is free to enter and has stickers and postcards afternoon evening my afternoon was spent going from mount takao to the tokyo skytree  i left takaosanguchi station around 2 00 and got to sumida around 4 00  it was around this time that i ran out of data for the day  to my surprise  so i had to scramble and find public networks to access my fast pass ticket  once i got it  i was up to the top very fast  i had tickets to the tembo galleria and skydeck  and again  it s worth it to get the full thing  this was a great way to cap off my trip because it was a clear day and i could see the sun set behind mount fuji  as well as the glow of the city below a bit later i figured i d have enough time to visit akihabara  so i went to an arcade and played for a while  then a few manga places  if i could rearrange my trip  i would ve spent at least a half a day here  i was only there for a couple hours my final meal was okonomiyaki from a restaurant in a nearby shopping center  i had no idea how to eat this this because there was a burner at the table  but it was good  i checked out those wacky vending machines and then headed back to my hostel tuesday  january 14th  shinjuku  gt  narita  gt  saipan morning checkout was simple  but with my flight leaving at 10 15 and me waking up at 6 30  i had to haul ass  i missed a train at shinjuku gyoenmae station that set me back a few minutes  and led me to nearly panic and scramble when i got to tokyo station  as the narita express was set to leave literally within 2 minutes of when my other train got there  here s a tip  don t wait for an elevator if you don t have to  always scan surrounding signs to see what trains are on what platforms  all i did was turn around and i had my answer you can get to narita airport an hour before your flight if you don t have checked bags  you should get to the airport two hours in advance  even though i couldn t  in the time i had there  i was able to check out the observation deck  get breakfast  and get a shirt for my sister  the flight back to saipan was smooth as always  and the  meal was another great touch it wasn t my goal to write a novel  but i felt like i could help others with my experience and pass it along  it all costed about  800 in the end  which was a bargain deal  let me know if you have questions edit  i forgot to add that i brought my pocket wifi back to saipan by mistake and had to mail it back with dhl for  50  otherwise it would have been  400  make sure you return these things edit 2  if you re in tokyo for at least a few weeks or a month  consider flying down to saipan  my rendation  or guam  they re basically the hawaiian islands of japan  although they re u s  territories  i would consider myself a great source for information on saipan travel  so please pm me if you want details ,1
looking for a very specific train tour ,i remember reading a news article on a plane once about a very scenic tour of the japanese countryside  way up to the northern islands  on an old fashioned steam train  on the inside it looked like fancy a hotel on wheels  like a japanese orient express  i believe the word  golden  was somewhere in its title   but the primary colour of the train seemed to be black  though i could be easy of car there  it all seemed so romantic  but in all my google searches have never found a train or coach tour that fits my memory of that news article   if  and when  i go to japan  this tour is top of my bucket list  was wondering if anyone could help me find out what this trai  or tour is ,1

miso brewery tours in english ,so my planned 2nd trip to japan next year is being postponed until a later date but hey that just gives me more time to find interesting things to do while there  the first time we went we hit up a lot of the standard tourist spots which i dont regret at all since they were super fun and interesting but now im hoping we can find things more specific to our particular interests this time around  and being a cook working my way to being a chef how food is made is incredibly fascinating to me none of us speak japanese outside basic travel phrases and a little cheat booklet for reading signs and menus and i dont think any of us will be able to get fluent enough to properly translate for the others by that time  so im hoping to see if there are any miso making places that offer tours in english or maybe at least a pamphlet that we can use to follow along  i tried google searches but they all seem toe up with the same suggestions and as far as i can tell from reviews  some very old so not sure if its still true or not  they dont have any english options   amp x200b the cities we will be in when we will have time to make a day trip or special outing to go for a miso tour are hakata  nagasaki  hiroshima  kyoto  and tokyo  we are hoping to be in japan from early may to early april  not sure if that would change anything  thank you for any advice and suggestions ,1

trip report  january 29th   february 9th   tokyo  gt  hakone  gt  kyoto  gt  tokyo,reminiscing on my fiance and i s trip to japan  i used this sub to plan a lot of things so i wanted to write up a trip report  thank you to everyone on this sub for your trip reports and advice  this was my second time in japan and my fiance s first  we had an amazing time and can t wait to go back again  we are 28 f and 37 m and live in nyc notes  transit  we both downloaded the suica app and loaded money onto it using apple pay  this was so convenient  there were only a couple of times we had to buy a ticket for public transit  we did not buy a jr pass because the cost of our train tickets pretty much added up to the cost of the jr pass and we rode some trains that were not included in the jr pass  it didn t make sense for us  we used the bus and subway to get around mostly  google translate  used this a lot to translate signs photos and talk to people who didn t know english  navigation  we used google maps which was amazing for both walking and navigating public transportation  we loved how it told us where to exit in train stations as well as which car to get on  so cool  wish we had this in nyc  coronavirus  i won t mention it other than here  news had beening out about coronavirus before our trip but we still decided to follow through with going  at this point not everyone was wearing masks  people in japan were talking about it way more than people in the us  none of our planned activities were impacted at all  i bought  this really awesome book  on amazon before our trip and we used it to find tons of restaurants in tokyo  i also  created a google map  with places of interest   restaurants   our hotels so if we ever didn t know what to do i would just open this map and see what was nearby  7 11  we ate a crap ton of food from 7 11 so i won t mention it throughout my report but we ate countless onigiri  egg sandwiches  and other sandwiches that we were obsessed with amp x200b wednesday  january 29th and thursday  january 30th  flight  amp  tokyo morning we had a direct flight from nyc  gt  narita  we lucked out by getting emergency exit seats at the check in counter  we were obsessed with the corn soup they served  so good  we purchased round trip jr narita express tickets for  38 each in the jr office in the train station  i had to show my passport to purchase evening hotel  onsen ryokan yuen shinjukuwe checked into our hotel around 6pm  i had purchased a wifi buddy that was delivered to our hotel  in hindsight i kind of regret purchasing this  we used wifi whenever we could and we both kept forgetting to connect to the wifi buddy   letting it die  both of our phone plans offer international usage for  10 a day  the wifi buddy was kind of a waste of money because our phone will automatically charge you  10 as soon as you start using international data  i feel like this subreddit persuaded me to rent one  onsen ryokan yen shinjuku was a really cool hotel  it had an onsen on the roof that we used a lot  the room was extremely small so i think our one regret was not upgrading to a larger room  none were available when we checked in  we stayed here for 4 nights after settling in we went to the onsen to clean off and relax  for dinner  we went to this amazing japanese bbq restaurant in shinjuku called jiromaru  it is standing room only and has room for around 10 people  it was a perfect first dinner in tokyo  we ate some amazing wagyu beef and veg  we wandered into a pachinko place on the way home and blew some money restaurant and food photo amp x200b friday january 31st  tokyo   shinjuku  meiji shrine  harajuku and kichijoji morning when we checked in we decided to book a traditional japanese breakfast at our hotel the next morning  it was really delicious but in hindsight i think we should ve eased into full on japanese food as we were still jet lagged and fish grossed me out for the rest of the day  even though i love it  lol breakfast we both walk a ton normally so we opted to walk a lot of places to soak in the city  we explored shinjuku and then headed to the metropolitan building for a view  there was a tour guide there telling us a lot of fun facts  it is cool that it is free next we walked to the meiji shrine  there was some sort of wedding or ceremony going on  i purchased a goshuincho book at the shrine and got a stamp we then headed to harajuku  we went into a store with all the toy dispensers which was really fun  we also went into an owl cafe but it ended up being really sad and i regret spending money there  i wish we did more research on this  we were really exhausted from walking a billion miles so we went into a little french cafe and had some drinks before going home to rest evening we booked  this kichijoji drinking tour  through airbnb experiences and it was one of the highlights of our trip  kichijoji was only a 15 minute train ride from shinjuku and was such a cool place  we never would ve gone without this tour but it ended up being our favorite neighborhood in tokyo  the tour mainly took place in harmonica alley before the tour started the guide gave us all these hangover drinks  i think they worked  we ended up drinking them every night before imbibing  we went to a bunch of the little 6 8 person bars  i mostly drank lemon sours  each bar had its own specialty food  we ate at one of them and had horse sashimi for the first time  the tour included 1 hour of unlimited food and drinks at a big izakaya barestaurant place where we had lots of snacks and drinks  played drinking games  and the waiters chugged beers with you  we ended the night at another bar that had karaoke  we also hung out outside and drank corn soup from a vending machine kichijoji   airbnb tour photos amp x200b saturday  february 1  tokyo   fish markets  amp  kappabashi dori street  kitchen district morning i don t know whose idea it was to book a 6 hour  6am tour of the fish markets after our drinking tour  but we pulled through  we  booked this tour through airbnb experiences  and loved it as well  our tour met at the toyosu fish market and we did not want to mess around with the subway that early  our hotel booked us a cab for 5 15am and it showed up right on time the tour ended up being longer than 6 hours and we covered so much  the guide dropped so much knowledge on us  toyosu fish market  walked around where vendors are selling everything  saw tuna auctions  saw a guy filet a fish and held a bunch of fish   crabs  tsukiji fish market  walked around the outer market and bought dashi and a few other items to take home  asakusa shrine  went to the guide s home and his wife prepared us a meal with the fish we had just purchased at the market  this meal included a lot of sake  we got to eat day old   fresh tuna and the difference was interesting  we ate special tuna from the head  a huge crab  oysters  sashimi  tempura  freshly grated wasabi  2 ways  and so much more  he also had a cool ice cream machine and we all made our own cone tour and meal photos  evening the tour ended around 4pm and i m not sure how we managed to continue our day after 4 hours of sleep and copious amounts of alcohol the night before but we stuck with our plan to go to the kitchen district  maybe it was all the sake at lunch we went to a bunch of stores on kitchen street  we bought knives  cups  bowls  and miniature food magnets  we bought the knives from kamaasa  they engraved our knives which was really cool  we also bought stuff from dengama and asakusaumegen  i m pretty sure we took the subway back home and had a lowkey night afterward amp x200b sunday february 2  tokyo   akihabara  jimobocho  shinjuku  yurakucho morning the next morning we forwarded our luggage to our hotel in kyoto with the help of the front desk  for 2 large suitcases and one carry on it was around  50  we were a little nervous doing this but just went for it  we each brought a backpack to carry our essentials we went to golden gai for breakfast and had yakitori  we just stopped at a random stall where a woman was already cooking food  it was so good photos of breakfast after breakfast  we took the subway to akihabara which was probably one of our favorite neighborhoods  we went to don quijotes  m s  mandarake  and a few other unplanned shops we wandered into  one of the highlights of akihabara was going to a maid cafe  there were so many choices but ended up going to u home cafe  we had to stand in line for around 15 minutes  some people were leaving and getting back in line which was crazy  we paid for coffees and 2 polaroid photos  we felt like if you spoke japanese it would ve been more enjoyable but was still a really cool experience  props to the people who work there because after 30 minutes it was a sensory overload after our jaunt around akihabara  i was determined to get some japanese curry  the tokyo book i purchased had an entire section dedicated to curry  so it was time  the book rended the jimbocho neighborhood to get curry  it also is known for used book stores  we first tried to go to curry bondy  we took an elevator upstairs with another couple and realized that there was a winding line all the way down the staircase  both couples got back in the elevator  the other couple got in line but we were too hungry to wait  we ended up going to another place rended in the book called ethiopia   which was also busy but had seats for us right away  we paid for our meals at a vending machine  a woman came over and asked us how much spice we wanted  i opted for no spiciness and my fiance got medium spicy  based on how much he was sweating whilst eating the curry  i can confirm medium was very spicy  i m also pretty sure she gave us something different than we ordered on the vending machine but she probably knew best photos of curry  evening we went back to the hotel to rest for a bit then headed back out  before dinner  we went to kurand sake market which was really freaking cool  you pay for unlimited sake for certain amounts of time  you can also bring in your own food  since we were going out to dinner afterward we paid for 30 minutes  i think there are a bunch of locations but we went to the one in shinjuku near our hotel we wanted to go to a new area so we headed over to yurakucho where there are a bunch of restaurants and bars under the tracks  it was pretty dead when we got there and a lot of restaurants were already past last call  it seems like this place is better toe to during the weekday  we ended up getting some gyoza at a place that was still open which was really delicious afterward  we went back to shinjuku for some karaoke  we went to a place called karaoke kan  it was so cool  we got our own private room and if we wanted to order drinks we just picked up the phone in our room and someone brought them to us sake market  dinner  and karaoke photos amp x200b monday  february 3  tokyo  gt  hakone morning we took the romance car train from shinjuku station to hakone yumoto station  it was about a 1 5 hour train ride  i had booked our seats in the front of the train as soon as i could  i think it s 2 months in advance  and then we purchased a limited express ticket  amp  hakone free pass at the station  after we got off at the station we walked to our ryokan  it wasn t too far of a walk  we bought so much food on the train because it came in themed romance car packaging  we also got an amazing view of mt  fuji on the way hotel   yama no chaya ryokanthis ryokan was amazing  we had never stayed at a ryokan before and we arrived earlier than check in so we dropped our stuff and went off to explore hakone  we stayed at this hotel for 1 night  we had our own onsen in our room as well as other onsens in the hotel we could explore  the nightly rate included breakfast and dinner  the woman who was assigned to our room was amazing and very attentive  we both agreed that it was really cool to do this for one night but we wouldn t have wanted to stay here longer as we like to go out and explore and this is the kind of place you stay and relax we toured around hakone  we took a bus  used the free pass to pay  to togendai station to see lake ashi and took the pirate ship sightseeing cruise  we opted for an upgrade to sit in the front of the ship  after the cruise  we got on the cable car and got off at owakudani  we did not eat black eggs but we walked around a bit  we hopped on another cable car and got off at the end   the railway was closed so we took a bus back to our hotel  the bus didn t accept the free pass so we had to pay  all of these activities were a lot of fun and it s really cool that it s included in the free pass hakone tour photos evening we went to the hotel bar dressed in our yakutas and had a couple of drinks  when it was time for dinner  we ate our kaiseki dinner in our room  which was delicious and so  much  food  after dinner the hotel staff switched out our table for our beds  the rest of the night we went into one of the ryokan s public onsens  our own private onsen  and watched movies on our little tv in the room  they had a dvd collection in the lobby photos of ryokan and dinner amp x200b tuesday  february 4  hakone  gt  kyoto morning in the morning we had our kaiseki breakfast and checked out at 10  checkout was really early  we took the train to odawara on the odakyu limited line then went to kyoto from there on the shinkansen  we had a bit of time in odawara so i grabbed some udon noodles  we hadn t booked any of these trains  we were able to just buy tickets at the station photo of udon hotel  the thousands kyotothis hotel was beautiful  the hotel was right next to the station which is about a 20 minute walk to the touristy areas of kyoto  we stayed in this hotel for 2 nights when we arrived at our hotel our luggage was waiting  yay  we got some drinks in the hotel bar then walked to the fushimi inari shrine  the walk was about 45 minutes  it was dark by the time we got to one of the viewpoints and we had a really pretty view of the city kyoto hotel photos evening i think i was extremely jet lagged this night and passed out but fiance went out and had dinner and drinks somewhere amp x200b wednesday  february 5  kyoto morning in the morning we slept in a bit and eventually walked over to nishiki market  before leaving our hotel we sent our luggage off to our hotel in tokyo  it was the same price as before  we were hungry and hadn t eaten proper sushi yet so we decided to eat at sushi no musashi for brunch which is a conveyor belt sushi place  so yummy  afterward  we took a long bus ride over to the tenryu ji temple  bamboo forest  and arashiyama monkey park  the bus ride was kind of cool since we got to see a lot of kyoto photos of sushi and bamboo forest area evening later on  we took another bus ride to the kyoto university area and just walked around  we had our sights set on tonkatsu for dinner but it didn t open until 5pm so we stopped off at a random cafe called trentanove for drinks and an appetizer  it waspletely empty except for us and a man taking a cappuccino design lesson  super cute place  it oddly started hailing outside while we were there for a bit  finally  the restaurant we wanted to go to for tonkatsu was open  it s called tonkatsu yamanaka  so we made our way over  the door was locked but the owner heard us trying toe in and opened up  i guess google was showing the incorrect hours and it actually opened a   later than google said  it was an old school restaurant with wood paneling and old school tv playing the news  the owner was so nice and gracious and chatted with us a bunch drinks  appetizers  and tonkatsu dinner amp x200b thursday  february 6  kyoto  gt  tokyo  kichijoji morning we were supposed to stay in a capsule hotel in kyoto for another night but felt we had seen enough of kyoto and wanted to go back to tokyo  we liked tokyo a lot more than kyoto  thankfully we hadn t pre booked our train or capsule hotel so we were able to go to the station and book a train to head back to tokyo evening hotel  park hyatt tokyowe had been psyched to stay at this hotel for our entire trip  we  of course  were inspired to stay here by lost in translation  this hotel was awesome  we spent a lot of time at the new york bar and loved our room  the only downside was that it is not close to the station in shinjuku  the walk is 20 minutes  they did have a shuttle to the station every half hour that we used to get around but we probably wouldn t stay here again based on location  our luggage was waiting for us when we arrived it took a few hours to get from kyoto to tokyo  after we checked into the hotel we relaxed and went to the hotel bar  after the bar  we headed back to our beloved kichijoji for more harmonica alley drinking and ramen park hyatt  kichijoji  and ramen photos friday  february 7  tokyo  bunkyo city  shinjuku morning after a nice lie in  we went to a tamago kake  egg over rice  restaurant called kisaburo nojo  i d been wanting to go here after seeing them go to it on terrace house  they have several different menu items but the star of the show is being able to go up to the egg table and pick out which eggs you d like to crack over your steaming hot rice  they have all types of eggs  some hens are only fed rice their entire lives which makes the eggs a different color  the food was excellent and i was happy to terrace house fangirl out for a bit  we walked home which took a few hours tamago kake photos  evening after resting at the hotel  our next stop was the robot restaurant  we were expecting something really cheesy  fully flying our tourist flags  we were pleasantly surprised with how well of a production it was  we bought drinks and popcorn and watched the show  the pre show was almost better than the actual show amp x200b saturday  february 8  tokyo   shinjuku  shibuya  ebisu  meguro morning our last full day in japan  so sad  we went back to the same yakitori place in golden gai for breakfast  we had not been to shibuya yet so we hopped on the subway down to shibuya  we went to starbucks to watch the people on the giant crosswalk which was fun  one food that we had not yet eaten was soba so we stopped by a soba restaurant called kamiyama in shibuya  it was delicious and had really pretty decor breakfast  shibuya and soba photos  evening time for another alley  we decided to explore ebisu yokocho  we were debating whether we should go back to kichijoji but we decided to go somewhere new  this alley was inside of a building which was different than the others we d visited before  after downing some hangover drink we walked through a few times to try and find a seat  we ended up at bekohira which is a place famous for their beef tongue  we stopped at a few other places for other snacks  we wanted to continue exploring and we were still hungry  how  so we walked to this yakitori restaurant in meguro called kushiwakamaru  it was awesome  there was a guy next to us that had been going to the restaurant for 10 years and he told us what to order  we ended the night at a punk rock bar called tatemichiya  it was cool but extremely smoky inside ebisu and kushiwakamaru photos amp x200b sunday  february 9  tokyo and flight morning fiance wanted ramen for breakfast so he went to piss alley to get ramen at this vendor we d seen another early morning  i wanted to do some last minute shopping  i stopped by beams  love this store  and the depachika in shinjuku to buy some goodies to bring home  i was so excited to find this prime minister cup we saw at the restaurant the night before  we tried to buy it from the restaurant but they said no  later on  we took a cab to the shinjuku station and caught the narita express to the airport  the flight home was smooth oops  that was really long  i hope you enjoyed the report and i can t wait to go back to japan  feel free to send any questions over ,1

okinawa tips guide,edit  for those interested  i have a travel focused instagram with pics of some of this  and much more  feel free to browse  deftonesrci wrote a lengthy response to a thread that got closed by the time i finished  didnt want it to go to waste  so here it is as promised  here are some places i found enjoyable while in okinawa  so  here we go 1  cape hedo   this is the farthest point north on the island  visually  its kinda of beautiful  but i really enjoyed the drive to and from here  i lived in uruma shi  to get there you can just take the west side of the island  58 i believe  and going back its nice to drive on the east side of the island  doing so will expose you to a bunch of small villages along the coastline  additionally  you can also take a random side road and see where the hell it goes  we ran into a few secluded beaches every so often tataki   tataki is a waterfall that you have to trudge through a small creek to get to  at the top you can swim around and just enjoy yourself  it s a beautiful jungle hike and is pretty safe  so don t stress any habu    miyagi island   this is a really fun place to just drive around and explore  there is a nice lookout and some super random hidden beaches that you can find  i ve gone here to have a beach bbq with a cheap don quixote grill and some yakitori  its pretty cool  but requires some work and exploration  some sites worth seeing are the nuchimasu salt factory and the happy cliff they have on their grounds  its quite a stunning view  my link below is to the remote beach and the salt factory hamahiga island   this is in the same general island chain as the above miyagi island  there is some fun places you can explore  like most of okinawa  you have to get there by car  then maybe bike around to really get a sense of it  this island is one of those places  if you can drive here then bike  that would be an awesome experience  the link below goes to a shrine to the god of the ryukyu islands  if memory serves manga souko   now this place is a place i went to waaaay too much   it is a great second hand store that you can find things for pretty cheap  i bought a bunch of work clothes and dishes here  they have a lot of fun stuff to look at including japanese anime toys  old and new video games  for collectors  you can get atari stuff there  books andics  vintage clothing  musical instruments  movies and music  and game machines to win stuff  in general  this store is pretty cool and i found myself there a lot  the link below is to the awase store  there are 2 others  one in urasoe and another in naha   seifa utaki   this is a sacred site to the ryukyus  and its very peaceful to walk around  you park at the bottom of the hill and walk up through this small marketplace  when i went nothing was open  but it looked like it could be pretty neat if it were   caf  kurakuma   this is a restaurant  thai  with an awesome view  we went here and just chilled out for a bit  it came rended by a friend who is native to the island  the food wasn t something you would lose your mind over  but i think the surroundings made it worth the trip  its near the above seifa utaki  so you could roll them into one trip gushikawa castle ruins   i randomly stumbled on this  it s the only castle i found that was located directly on the coastline  the landscape is this really bizarre porous stone that resembles an alien landscape  great views here as well  running theme  this is one of the last things i did before leaving okinawa kouri island   this island is similar to most areas  but getting here is really awesome  the bridge you cross to get here is breathtaking  i wasn t expecting it when i navigated here  and it was a great surprise  the island warrants a bit of exploration that i didn t have enough time to get to  maybe you can pick up on my slack    wansaka oura   this place is actually a travel stop of some sort  but it acts as a good staging point for central nago  specifically i enjoyed the stroll through the mangroves  there isn t much to the town beyond that  but you can walk through it and check out the shisa road they have  i would rend doing this either on the way in  or out of  another destination  maybe hit it on the way to from hedo bise fukugi tree road   this is a really quaint town that that has a network of roads that are unpaved and lined with these fuku trees  on one end you have the ocean  with  you guessed it  a stunning view  and on the other side you have the town and its neat roads  it s a nice peaceful stroll that brings you back to what okinawa may have looked like in the past  its not far from churami  but you ve already done that  well  still worth the drive considering you can get gas super cheappared to the local economy kokusai dori   this is a marketplace in naha that has some fun shopping and food  on the whole the food is amazing in oki kobe bar nakanaka   this is a place to get kobe beef   small little bar type joint with a cook who has a british accent  i found this awesome haha  of course  he could have moved on  who knows  but the place is worth a visit  just eat the beef with salt and wasabi  here you can try out the ishigaki beef as well  that is the okinawa specific wagyu southeast botanical gardens   here is a place i lived near  on my way home from work i would stop here and walk around then head home  i had an annual pass  across from it is a cool noodle place where you can pick up some okinawa soba   i also bought a bottle of their chili oil and still use it now there is also some stuff like american village  which has a really cool nightlife scene  just a lot of military guys around there  so i didn t include it here  if you do go there  check out okinawa brewing co  and have a flight  nearby is chatan brewing co which is also good  its worth seeing as the seawall is spectacular that s enough for now haha  let me know if you have any specific interests and i can provide some insight  as u takaonogaijin said there is some seriously awesome diving  but i never really got into that as much  so he may be able to provide more insight ,1

my 2020 japan food album ,hey guys  i hope everyone is safe and well   it s a trying time for everyone in the world so hopefully this album can bring a little happiness to you   this is my third time to japan and i went for two weeks in january 2020  just before all this madness started on this trip i went to osaka  kyoto  uji  tokyo and fukuoka   fukuoka has amazing food and should really be on a lot of people s list in the future my 2016 album my 2018 album my 2020 album and here are my top 5 experiences on this trip spice chamber  kyotothis is my new favourite japanese curry place in japan   it s a small little restaurant in kyoto  run by a nice young couple   all they serve is this  and they do it well   it s got around 8 bar seats and that s it   the curry was really nicely spiced  and the cheese on top really balances it well   also  the owner loves david bowie and rock and roll  so the music was also pretty good ganso tomato ramen sanmi  ramen stadium in fukuokathis was tomato soup ramen in canal city mall in fukuoka   i ve never seen tomato soup as a base for ramen  but it was really delicious   the cheese on top also adds a lot of flavour motsunabe rakutenchi  fukuokawow  this was awesome   it s a giant hot pot with pork offal and random meat   you also get lots of cabbage and green onions and they give you rice   it was one of my favourite meals on the trip  and i think this was around 3000 yen for the two of us  dazaifu  kyushuthis was a little place near dazaifu shrine in kyushu   the curry was ok  but the most memorable thing was it run by just one woman   maybe she didn t have help that day  but she took customers in  served  cooked and did everything by herself in a restaurant of 20   she had to refuse service to some outside because she didn t have time to clean the tables   still  she took every effort to make the food look amazing and still served everything with a smile kaisen misakiko okachimachi  ueno  tokyoi went here more for the kitsch factor than the actual food   who doesn t want their food delivered by a jr train   it was just funny to have the train deliver my sushi to me   the quality of the sushi was your average conveyor belt sushi but it was a quick meal and memorable experience ,1
kyoto for new years   where to eat osechi ,hi all  my girlfriend and i are planning to do a trip to kansai dec 27th   1st  taking the shinkansen to tokyo on the 1st to catch a flight on the 2nd at haneda  we re staying 2 nights  27 29  in osaka and 3 nights in kyoto  29 1  so we can go for hatsu moode  yes  we know that all the shrines will be super crowded but i think we d like to try it out we re debating between whether we should stay at a super fancy hotel  like the park hyatt or the ritz carlton  using points  or a business hotel  we don t expect to spend much time in the hotel anyway  so maybe a business hotel near higashiyama will do  my main question is whether fancier hotels would offer osechi  if not  we re perfectly fine with buying them at a depachika and eating it in our hotel room  please give us some suggestions  thank you ,1

where to find japanese fine china  as in teacups ,i have an odd personal goal where i m working on building a tea set with different pieces i ve picked up in traveling  so far i have a creamer from london  one teacup and saucer from luxembourg  and a teapot i picked up in kyoto years ago before i thought to do this   because i intend to go back to japan  i d like to pick up at least a teacup and saucer from there   i have some more traditional japanese teacups for my green tea habit  but i know japan must produce western style tea china does anyone know of places in tokyo  maybe antique typed shops  that would be a good spot to hunt down my next tea piece ,1

to destinations  but hey those places are popular for a reason right  had an amazing time  and could easily do the same places again and see loads of stuff i missed i m a solo traveller  32 m from uk  must have taken a couple of thousand photos  took two lenses  but mainly ended up using my 16 200mm exclusively  so have just picked a few for this post general stuff  corona virus stuff  so from a purely selfish standpoint i went at the perfect time  way fewer foreign tourists than usual so places were quieter  but the virus wasn t as serious then so everywhere was still open  more masks than usual and hand sanitizer everywhere  on the final couple of days of my trip places were starting to close  but i didn t miss out on anything  i booked this trip around september last year though  so i was pretty much just lucky  don t overdo it  make peace with the fact you ll miss stuff  it s fine  you ll most likely do another trip  take the time to enjoy the places you re going properly  and enjoy just being in a new place while you walk around  also don t feel guilty about spending time just people watching in a cafe or relaxing in your hostel  it s all part of the experience  don t be too worried about the language barrier  i learned a bit more than the usual greetings thanks etc  but didn t use much  generally people will know what they need for their line of work  shops will know how to ask for tax free  take out etc  in english at least  and anything else you can figure out by pointing  gesturing etc  that said  the little i did learn was good for the odd little chats you find yourself in on trains  in hotels  bars and so on  so if you can learn a bit  great  if not  don t worry  walk everywhere  i did the  get off a stop early  pretty often and walked back to my hostel hotel most nights if the walk was around or under an hour  tokyo especially is full of cool random shit you ll never see by sticking to the main areas  but also have good shoes  i picked up some  vans ultrarange  for the trip and they were amazing  eat and drink plenty  not just because it s tasty  but because you ll more than likely be walking way more than you re used to and it s easy for hours to go past quickly without realising  i had a couple of early afternoons feeling slightly lightheaded before stopping to scarf down some food and feeling much better  i found that the unreserved seats on the shinkansen were basically empty anytime i used them  now i wasn t in peak tourist time and the virus meant less tourists so take it with a pinch of salt  but don t panic if you can t reserve a seat amp x200b thursday 13th friday 14th   flight and tokyo mostly taken up by the flight  i went from manchester  via munich into tokyo haneda  would definitely rend grabbing a ticket to your  local airport lounge  before your trip  unlimited food and drinks  was a cool way to start the trip and really quiet and relaxingpared to the terminal  flight to munich was via lufthansa  then ana from munich to tokyo  great service from both  especially ana when it came to food and overall experience  had a good chat with one of the cabin crew  she was from kyoto  mentioned the reduction in tourism due to the virus  whilst approaching tokyo and got a little ana care package too there was temperature monitoring via a thermal cam when going through customs  and had a slight panic moment when i got pulled aside to have a forehead scan  luckily it was just the 11 hours in a warm plane and the long ass walk from the gate that had me a bit sweaty  so passed through without issue  grabbed the usual bits  rail pass  suica  pocket wi fi  and took the monorail to my hostel    wise owls tokyo  arrived around 6pm and was determined not to fall asleep  but turns out travelling for nearly 20 hours and not sleeping on the plane makes you pretty tired  woke up just after 11pm and had a walk around for a couple of hours  followed by some random 7 11 snacks then went to bed around 2am amp x200b saturday 15th   asakusa  ginza  jinbocho woke up around 6am and headed to  asakusa  to wander around and visit  senso ji before it got busy  realised it might be a little  too  early as nothing was open for a couple of hours   but it was a beautiful morning  so just walking for a while with the city waking up was nice  grabbed some breakfast before visiting  mokuhankan  for a wood block printing party  was just  myself and a friendly couple from south africa  but was really fun and the staff give you a pretty great insight into the history of the printing process  you get to keep  the print you make  and i bought another too  rended ventured into the local don quijote after some random street snacks at senso ji for lunch  but quickly realised i d be best saving it for my final couple of days back in tokyo when i d be doing my souvenir shopping  also i think my travel addled brain might have had a bit of a seizure with the amount of lights and jingles and stuff happening afternoon plan was originally to head to the edo museum  but my pocket wi fi decided it didn t want to charge  rather than be stuck with no internet i had to head back to haneda to swap it as the desks in the city weren t open on weekends  gave past me a big pat on the back for not booking a flight into narita  took a train back to jinbocho  with a detour via ginza to check out the closed weekend streets  with the plan to do a couple of hours looking through old bookshops for interesting stuff  but was a little too tired  food at yoshinoya  then back to the hostel with plans for a chill evening with other travellers buton area was pretty dead  my brain appreciated the early night though amp x200b sunday 16th   ghibli museum  open air edo museum  kichijoji  shinjuku another early start  dropped my bigger bag off at akasaka station as i was switching my hostel to  kaisu  a couple of minutes away later in the day  really good  stay here if you can  train then over to kichijoji station and a relaxing morning walk through  inokashira park  before the ghibli museum  was a very pleasant way to spend a morning  small but super charming and grabbed a few bits from the gift shop and some lunch from the cafe after lunch spent an hour or so walking to the tokyo edo open air museum  small town tokyo was super nice to wander round  especially with even less tourists than usual  the museum was great  was worried it might be a bit too dry but the  variations in buildings  are neat and the reconstructed stores are  super cool  staff were also great  even if only a couple spoke english  sat with a couple of old lads who were volunteering and drank roasted tea made over an open fire in a reconstructed 17th century farmhouse  and just about managed a conversation through the odd word and hand signals  was brilliant  another hour or so walk back to musashi koganei station and jumped off at jinbocho again to catch the  lights at dusk  picked up some awesome donuts at hara donuts  then back to the hostel for a nap after dodging plenty of touts i met up in  shinjuku  and golden gai with some folks from the japantravel line group  and we got chatting to another american guy who lived in tokyo  i would do a longer bit here  but my memory goes hazy at around 2am  i remember  karaoke with australians   locals buying us drinks  then stumbling onto a train around 7am  fucking brilliant night amp x200b monday 17th   sleeeeeeeeeeeep  roppongi hills oof  woke up around 1pm then again around 4pm  wasn t feeling my best so went with the best hangover cure there is even when you re on the other side of the world   mcdonalds  it tastes exactly the same  but also made me feel alive again  along with somebini chicken and a few pocari sweats  met up with a few of the guys from the night before again in roppongi hills  but it was super quiet everywhere we went  had a few beers at a couple of different bars but they had to grab the last train back  so went for a solo midnight wander over to  tokyo tower  then back over to my hostel amp x200b tuesday 18th   odaiba  harajuku  shibuya morning train to over to the east of the city for the first slot in the day with teamlab planets  a short but very cool experience  definitely rended  no spoilers  couple of hours of walking over the various man made islands in the area  really nice morning again so some  great views  of  the city lunch in the diver city shopping centre and spent a bit of time marvelling at the  unicorn gundam statue  listen  i m a nerd and giant robots speak to me  but even if you re not super into gundam this thing is  fucking cool  try and make one of the  transformation times to get hype train over to the other side of the city and visited  meiji jingu   very impressive  and as always the  go one path away from the main bit  rule applied  walk two minutes from the shrine through the park and there is no one there  super relaxing  and cool to be able to only hear the trees even though you re in the middle of tokyo  followed it up with the total opposite  a walk through harajuku and over to  shibuya  was supposed to be on a shopping ban until my return to tokyo  but the stickers in b side were too much of a draw  staff were awesome here too  mention you re a tourist and you ll get some freebies with your purchases after some exploring of shibuya i walked the hour or so back to my hostel  some awesome little shops and houses in the backstreets on the way back  food at some random ramen place then a couple of beers in the hostel bar before bed amp x200b wednesday 19th   shinkansen to hiroshima up nice and early for the first train to hiroshima  with a changeover at shin kobe  got chatting to a guy on the second train who worked for a lumber business  very affluent  old school dude with some questionable traditional views on  men at work  family at home  but who was also self aware and very funny  exchanged line info and he offered to buy me dinner when i was in kyoto later in the trip  never took him up on the offer and super regretted it  can imagine it would have been a better meal than i could have ever afforded   also got a fantastic view of mt  fuji on the way arrived in hiroshima in the early afternoon and dropped my bag off at the hostel  akicafe  another nice place right next to the station  spend the rest of the day walking through the city to the  peace park  and museum  no pictures inside obviously  it s a pretty intense place but  definitely worth a visit  wandered over to  hiroshima castle  and the  gardens  before heading back to the hostel for an early evening nap woke up hungry so got  okonomiyaki at tampopo  super cool little family run place  they have  maps and books  where foreign visitors can put a little sticker and message showing where they re from  i m the blue at the top left  also  okonomiyaki  was probably my favourite thing i ate from the whole trip  so much so i bought a couple of the hiroshima gacha pods to make sure i got the  mini okonomiyaki set amp x200b thursday 20th   miyajima  amp  kyoto spent the morning and most of the afternoon on  miyajima  it really reminds you that you re actually in the pacific and places can look pretty tropical even in winter  unfortunately the ropeway was closed and i didn t have the time to hike to the top of the mountain  but it s a  gorgeous little island  main areas were pretty busy with  mostly  japanese tourists  but again walk 2 minutes off the beaten path and you re basically alone  loads of little  foresty areas  and  shrines to visit  also the deer are  chill and cute as fuck wish i d budgeted more time for hiroshima  but had to catch my train up to kyoto  arrived around 7pm and checked into my hostel  mosaic  a little out of the city centre but another good place  had a wander around the local big aeon mall and a little into kyoto itself  coco for a late dinner as a lot of places were closed  then back just after midnight amp x200b friday 21st   toji park  nishiki market  shrines i was lucky enough to be in town for the toji flea market  so headed down early  was already pretty busy around 9 ish  and spent a few hours browsing the stalls  speaking to stall owners and eating various delicious things  didn t buy much  but found a guy selling old postcards and retro stamps and stuff so grabbed a few of those  go here if you re in kyoto at the right time  it s a great way to spend a few hours  stayed in toji for a bit and wandered around the  gardens and the big pagoda  before heading into kyoto proper another couple of hours scoffing snacks and street food in nishiki market  although didn t go for the sparrows on sticks  loads of shopping streets in this area  so spent a good couple of hours wandering around  also  calling out  karaage umeshin  because it s easily the best fried chicken i ve ever had  i had the plum salt flavouring and was thinking about it the rest of the trip walked for a bit over to  heian shrine  super quiet despite it  being another amazing day  the gardens were  gorgeous  despite the lack of foliage in winter  can imagine they look insane in spring or autumn  managed to get to  nanzen ji  before it closed  another stunning area that shows how quickly kyoto goes from bustling city to quiet woodlands headed back for an early evening nap then headed out to wander ponto cho and some of the other cool little backstreets by night  couple of beers and some food but not a super late night  back just before midnight amp x200b saturday 22nd   fushimi inari  train museum got to  fushimi  just before the goshuin office opened around 8 30am  was already a fair few people there but no massive hordes so managed to get  that picture everyone takes  did the hike to the top and back down  definitely gets quieter as you head up the trail and it was mostly locals heading to  specific shrines  along the trail to pray had plans for gion and the surrounding area for the rest of the day but started raining super heavily   train museum  was my backup plan for any rainy days so headed there  i m not specifically a train nerd or anything  but the history of the railways was really interesting and there s plenty to see  good english support through their app too  and  nice views from the roof  the gift shop here was nuts  train people are obviously on a mission and the shop was cramped as fuck with people rushing around not caring who they pushed out the way dinner at  chao chao gyoza   happy hour set and a couple of extra drinks obvs  before heading back to the hostel  was a pretty busy few days so just relaxed at the hostel before heading for an early night amp x200b sunday 23rd   osaka later start  relatively  than usual today  but was on the train to osaka by around 10am  another bag drop ready for my hostel check in  the stay shinsaibashi  very nice and modern  wandered through the shopping area to dotonbori  snacking on various things along the way  indulged my yakuza 0 fandom a bit on the  bridge and the surrounding area  before taking a train to the kaiyukan aquarium i  loved  this   fish are cool  but what s cooler is a  giant tank filled with a simulated ocean  must have spent at least 4 or 5 hours here  then another good 45mins in the gift shop at the end  if you re even slightly interested in nature or animals take the time to go to the aquarium  you might have to wait for your time slot but the shopping centre next door has plenty to to and eat while you wait headed back to the hostel  via another b side stop  love those stickers  for my patented early evening nap  got some dinner and met up with a couple of folks from the line group for what was supposed to be just a couple of drinks  obviously that turned into  karaoke   several drinks in is the only time you ll get me singing maroon 5  being squished into the tiniest bar with 20 other people and 4am and drinks in some random tiki bar a drunk new zealander told us about where the owner made me some kind of alcoholic slushie  super fun amp x200b monday 24th   sumiyoshi taisha  osaka castle chill morning  no hangover  result  in the hostel doing some laundry and sorting out my bags  before heading out to sumiyoshi shrine  wasn t anything super special  but had a pretty open day on my itinerary so wasn t in a rush to be anywhere  ate some takoyaki in the park next to the station before an hour or so in the shrine itself  wouldn t go out of your way toe here but the  bridge is pretty  and i needed an osaka stamp for my goshuin took the tram back to town after some help from the station guards in finding the platform  the one time google maps let me down  i ve seen some folks say the reconstructed castles aren t worth visiting  but i would totally disagree  yeah they ve been rebuilt  but they re still  incredibly impressive  and have good exhibits inside if you re into your history  also a nice time of day late in the afternoon for some  nice views  of  osaka from the top my original plan was one final night in osaka before getting the first train to tokyo in the morning  but by this point i was craving a hotel room after nearly 2 weeks of hostels  fyi i m nearly 6ft 3  so even the best of those pods were limited for space  changed my plans and jumped on a train back to tokyo  obviously not before grabbing a  meal for the journey  i felt like a fucking genius when i got into the hotel room and was able to just dump my stuff  have a shower in my own bathroom and sprawl out on the bed  stayed at the  hotel route inn grand tokyo asakusabashi  which was insanely good value and a way bigger room than expected  had initial plans to venture out for food but was so relaxed i was done for the night amp x200b tuesday 25th   shibuya  shinjuku  nakano  akihabara back to tokyo  i had always planned a couple of final days to fill in some of the gaps from the first few days and finally do a shit load of shopping first off was a visit to a happy pancake in shibuya  with a final meetup from the line group  everyone i met on the trip was super friendly  and with 5 of us meeting for pancakes we each got a different version and shared them out  they were all amazing  and  definitely lived up to the hype then shopping  parco center was great for video game stuff  with the nintendo  pokemon and ca stores being the standouts  then loft  tokyu hands  village vanguard  don quijoite  etc  etc  endless places to go if you have the time  also made a trip to nakano broadway  but think this would be better if you have some specific stuff you re looking for as there are lots of little shops with shit loads of stuff in each went back to the hotel and dumped a few bags of stuff before grabbing a train to  akihabara  was pretty late by this point so spent a bit of time in the arcades  didn t win any crane prizes but played plenty of rhythm games  then finally off to don quijote at midnight for a suitcase to put everything i was buying in amp x200b wednesday 26th   akihabara  skytree the last day   i spent the majority of the morning and afternoon trawling akihabara and the various nerdy shops  got some ff7r stuff in kotobukiya  a bunch of gundam after being paralyzed by choice in yodobashi and bic camera  a monster hunter figure i had been hunting for years in madarake and countless other cool stuff  went to a bunch of video game shops too but didn t actually pick anything up  which was probably the right choice considering the state of my luggage on the way back quick stop at the hotel to dump everything before heading over to the skytree  didn t realise the shopping centre at the base was so massive  so spent an hour or so in the various shops and places to eat while waiting for just before sunset to head up the tower  got the best of both worlds  the city just as the sun was setting and then the view of the lights and night  it was a bit misty but still a  totally amazing view of tokyo i was lucky enough to visit when the final fantasy vii remake collab was happening  and wandering around the upper level of the skytree surrounded by  props and exhibits  with the soundtrack playing and  was super cool  narrowly avoided dropping  60 on the fancy soundtrack vinyls in the pop up shop  but grabbed a  cloud  drink  apparently he s pineapple flavour  back down to the main viewing area to catch the little  ffviir video they had projected on the windows  before calling it a night  with  one last nice view  super tired by this point  so one final coco curry trip  chicken and sausage eff the haters  and back to the hotel to pack up my mountain of stuff amp x200b thursday 27th   flight home  so glad i left shopping to the last couple of days  as i went from a backpack and small holdall to those plus a giant suitcase and one extra big shopping bag  early train to haneda  check in and spend the last of my suica credit on some snacks  haneda has a good viewing area  so spent some time there before the shops opened  and also had to get the special  pikachu in a cabin crew  costume  crammed some final souvenirs into my carry on before heading home amp x200b well that ended up being longer than i thought  hopefully this was helpful or at least worth reading  it was fun to reminisce about my trip and remind myself of all the places i need to add to my list for the next time ,1
trip report   february march 2020   tokyo  eight days,i m currently a bit bored stuck at home  so i decided that it was time to put together this trip report  and also allows me to reminisce about my trip  as i am missing tokyo so very much    amp nbsp this was a trip that was in the works for almost an entire year  and that time spent makes for a bit of a saga as well so i m going to include it in the hopes that it gives people some insight about what to do and what not to do in the lead up to their visits     amp nbsp also  given that it was just before the time when the us and canada were talking about possibly ramping up their travel advisories  and air canada had not yet extended their goodwill rescheduling policy to japan  there was a slight damper on things for sure  but we made an informed choice  we stayed safe both during and after our trip  and it was a great experience amp nbsp note that the purpose of our trip was to do lots of shopping for retro anime toys and novelties  and lots of street food amp nbsp may 2019  bought economy class tickets through  ana  with one connection  flying from  yyz  gt gt  iad  gt gt  nrt  and then  nrt  gt gt  ord  gt gt  yyz  on our way back  my primary aim was to fly ana because i had heard great things about their economy product  and the tickets that i found were very cheap  however  i guess i didn t really think things through because  after a time  i started worrying about having to collect baggage  clear customs  and recheck baggage at o hare  and the process bugged me a bit  flying into iad wouldn t have been as big of an issue since yyz offers us pre clearance  i even went so far as to purchase premium access for the flights into iad and out of ord since those flights were provided by united  just to make sure the connection was smoother  anyways  more on this later in the year  i also  around this time  made a reservation for a hotel in  ikebukuro amp nbsp june 2019   february 2020  this was probably the nuttiest time period for me  this was when i started planning out an itinerary for our trip  for a period of time  there was not one day that went by that i didn t refer to  or tweak  or otherwise work on my google spreadsheet  pros  when we finally arrived  i was so well prepared having so studied up on tokyo that everything was smooth  from getting around on the rail lines  to using a suica card  to navigating streets  etc  cons  i drove myself nuts  looking at pictures on google maps  plotting out optimum dates and times to make online reservations for cafes  etc  in the end  we decided to make reservations and pre purchase tickets for  pokemon cafe   kirby cafe   eorzea cafe   tokyo disneyland   ghibli museum   sunshine city sky circus   tokyo skytree  and a kaiseki dinner reservation at  nadaman shinjuku amp nbsp october 2019  disaster  or an opportunity  our flight from  yyz  gt gt  iad  was cancelled  it was an early morning flight  and the only other flight that would have allowed us to still take the ana jet on time would be from the previous night  so  i took the opportunity to get a full refund on this flight since it was considered a major change to my itinerary  dropped the idea of flying ana  for now  and decided to purchase economy class tickets through  air canada  instead  flying from  yyz  gt gt  hnd  no need to transit through the us if i didn t need to  the tickets were slightly more expensive  but not terribly so   amp nbsp february march 2020  as part of my planning  i also kept a close eye on the available seats on my flight into  hnd  and noticed that although it was a busy flight  it wasn t anywhere near full  so i decided to seize the opportunity  and put in a low ball bid for an upgrade to  air canada signature class  and got in  definitely an unexpected expense  but this trip was meant to be our long overdue honeymoon and  realistically  i don t fly enough to be able to ever upgrade flights in the future using points  and i don t work a cushy corporate job that would ever allow me to expense business class flights  air canada  has three classes  economy  premium economy  and signature  besides  upgrading my economy tickets cost way less than buying signature class tickets outright  so i consider it a victory amp nbsp february march 2020 cancellations  unfortunately  tokyo had begun to close certain attractions  so we were not able to go to  ghibli museum   tokyo disneyland   sky circus  or  skytree  however   jtb canada   who sold us the ghibli museum tickets  actually processed the refund for us immediately without being asked  i think they processed it minutes after sending me an email about the closure  and  klook  refunded my sky circus and skytree passes without a little bit of poking and prodding  tokyo disneyland was a bit moreplicated  it took them awhile to release the web form for refunds  and the form itself i felt was unnecessarily convoluted  but i ve submitted my refund request and am now waiting for results amp nbsp saturday   arrived at  yyz  checked in  airports are definitely quieter than usual  but nowhere near as quiet as it eventually got  before everything was shut down  having upgraded our tickets  we were able to access the  maple leaf lounge  which was nice but nothing special  and i know how privileged that sounds  don te for me  it allowed us a few hours of quiet isolation  though  when we finally boarded the plane  i made aitment to enjoy every last minute of the experience  because again  it ll probably never happen again for me   although  mentally  i have made a smallitment to myself to at least consider trying to upgrade at least once per decade amp nbsp sunday  arrived at  hnd terminal 1  at 4 55 pm  going through customs and immigration was super easy  and the customs agents were very friendly  when we arrived in the arrivals lobby  although i had seen pictures  maps  and videos that gave me a sense of where different locations were  it was still very overwhelming so needed to ask the information desk staff a few times  but eventually got my bearings  went to the departures level in order to pick up my pocket wifi from  japan wireless  and purchased two  wee suica cards  at the  jr east travel service centre  and loaded them each with ¥10000  went back out to the bus platforms in order to catch the  airport limousine  to  ikebukuro  although we exited customs and immigration much earlier than expected  airport limousine staff were super aodating in allowing us to board an earlier bus  the ride took about an hour and a half  and dropped us off at  ikebukuro station  west exit  where we slowly pushed our suitcases and found our way to our hotel  we were absolutely exhausted  but didn t want to waste our first evening in tokyo  so after checking in at the hotel  we went back out to do some essentials shopping at  donki  had a quick meal via a 7 11 run  then spent a few hours at  game st  tropez  a game centre east of ikebukuro station  we must have spent a fortune on  ufo catchers  and  gem pushers  but we wiped out their supply of kirby prizes lol   oh  and a giant moomin plushie  oh  how i love japanese conbini  many taps of a suica card were made at  7 11   lawson  and  family mart  love that they are all over the place  love that the food is of so high quality  for convenience store food  and love that they are so convenient and open 24 7   amp nbsp monday  this was our  nakano  day   nakano broadway  is an absolute mecca for anyone interested in retro toys  so it had to be first on our itinerary  we chose to arrive a little bit earlier in order to go to  namco nakano  first  which is another game centre  yes  they are everywhere in tokyo  while waiting for nakano broadway to open  we also perused and spent coins on gachapon machines  anyways  we had a list of major items that we wanted to purchase  so we decided to go find those items first  buy them  process the tax free claims  always look for  tax free counters  it s super simple  doesn t cost you very much time at all  and the hassle when leaving japan was non existent  and then went back to our hotel to drop off our purchases before spending the rest of the day enjoying ourselves  speaking of travel  the rail lines in tokyo are super convenient and extremely intuitive  it did not take me very long at all to navigate the lines like a pro  aided by google maps which i found to be invaluable  to this day  when i close my eyes  i will sometimes hear the friendly yamanote line station announcer repeating  mejiro   takadanobaba   shin okubo  anyways  while exploring  nakano broadway  and  nakano sunmall  we also took the chance to try the koala s march pastries at  lotteria  dimsum at  daily handmade dimsum  and a bit of an odd choice but i wanted to try  mcdonald s  while we were here lol  towards the end of the day  we went back to ikebukuro and had dinner at  sushi zanmai  i have to say  although the sushi was delicious  and i do love sushi  i found the sushi a bit underwhelming  maybe because i m quite particular with my sushi and we do have some good sushi restaurants in canada  don t laugh  they are pretty good   amp nbsp tuesday  this was our  pokemon cafe  day  we started off by travelling to  kichijoji  in order to pick up  eorzea cafe  tickets that were purchased for us through  voyagin  before going to the voyagin office  we took a short walk through the  east gardens of the imperial palace  it was quiet  peaceful  beautiful gardens  a highlight was walking across the koi pond  from there  we walked through  ginza  towards the pokemon cafe  which was attached to  nihombashi takashimaya  a huge department store  and  well  all i ll say is i ve never been in a department store where an entire corridor of elevators were each individually operated by an elevator attendant  what a ritzy five minutes  anyways  the  pokemon cafe  is a must for anyone who is remotely interested in pokemon  the decor was super cute and attentive  and the dishes were so on point   everything looked exactly like in the menu  staff were super into the experience for their customers as well  and although there are pokemon centres in many key locations in tokyo  i felt that the  pokemon centre dx  next door to the cafe  was the superior pokemon centre  best stocked  largest  with lots of exclusive merchandise  don t miss it for the shopping and the photo opportunities  by now  though  the jet lag was starting to catch up with us  so we decided in the moment to take the rest of the day off  we were originally going to stop in shibuya   pro tip  do not be afraid to schedule in rest  or decide to take a break on the spot  during your stay  it is better to voluntarily take the time to rest  than to be forced to stop because your knees are locking or your feet just can t take another step anymore  tokyo will still be there in the morning  we did head back out later that night to another game centre though  lol  oh  and we also had dinner at  ichiran ikebukuro  it was  missable  but the chashu was  delicious   amp nbsp wednesday  we decided to change our schedule to visit  shibuya  and  akihabara  today  shibuya was mainly a shopping and walking excursion  highlights included  parco  in which we spent way more than we should have in the  nintendo store  personally  i m very selective when ites to personal souvenirs  but there were some zelda themed ties that i couldn t resist  i also bought a gorgeous set of pokemon tins  which held seaweed snacks  but have now been repurposed as tea tins   tokyu hands  was also great for purchasing household goods  such as an onigiri press and some nori punches   loft  was great for tokyo souvenirs on the top floor  but  honestly  buy your magnets and keychains at  donki  instead for half the price  for lunch  we went to  genki sushi  for the experience of ordering sushi that arrived on little monorails  again  the sushi was a bit underwhelming  but the experience was great fun  after dropping purchases off at our hotel in ikebukuro  we headed out for  akihabara  in the late afternoon early evening  which was a bit  well  eye opening  had to run the gauntlet of maid cafe touts  as we made our way to  super potato  a store selling retro video games  equipment  and merchandise  the main purpose of our akihabara visit  though  was to go to  eorzea cafe  a final fantasy xiv themed restaurant  a very small restaurant located in the pasela resortsplex  it was fully immersive  and again  the attention to detail in the dishes was amazing  we spent an absolute fortune on food and drinks  but i figured that next time i m in tokyo  it s not like i ll want toe back anyways  so might as well splurge now   amp nbsp thursday  we decided to sleep in a little bit today  but then headed to  tokyo station  where we spent some time shopping on  character street  loads of fun  lots of iconic little stores and pop ups  ghibli  hello kitty  moomin  precure  pokemon  etc  but honestly was starting to feel shopped out  don t forget to claim the tax free status  we also had lunch at a tempura restaurant in  kitchen street  which was absolutely delicious  afterwards  we wanted to go back to shibuya to go to  village vanguard   think hot topic  and  graffart  in  magnet by shibuya 109  and were able to visit the observation deck where we took great photos of  shibuya crossing  from above  went back to ikebukuro  by the way  it should be noted that throughout our stay  we bought hot food  snacks  and drinks regularly at 7 11  lawson  and famima  so it was a non stop food fest  we decided that this was a good night for curry and gaming  so we had dinner at  coco ichibanya   oh  my  god  such a simple and humble plate of fast casual food  but it was easily the best thing i put in my mouth  well  that  and  kare pan   amp nbsp friday  we spent all day friday in  ikebukuro  started off in  sunshine city  checking out the  pokemon centre  and  pikachu sweets  cafe  again  a bit underwhelmingpared to pokemon centre dx  and  alpa  where we basically cleared out their fire emblem  three houses merchandise  we had lunch at a tendon restaurant in sunshine city  a fast casual restaurant   tendon tenya  which was delicious and  in my opinion  much better than our tokyo station pick  before leaving for  graffart  and  mandarake lalala   for more retro anime purchases  we then went to  animate  which is a multi floor store selling manga  anime merchandise  video game merchandise   the store blew my mind  there was something that caught my eye on virtually every floor  but it was soooooo busy and popular  overall  though  this was a bit of a quieter day  so we didn t do a whole lot  called it a day  ate re heated conbini food  gyudon  tempura on soba  buns and pastries  and chilled in our hotel amp nbsp saturday  this was our last full day  and we did tons  we started by traveling to  asakusa  where we took photos in front of  bandai   they have statues of their most iconic characters  set up on the sidewalk outside and around their headquarters  from there  we went to  skytree solamachi   we could have walked across the bridge  but we were exhausted  so we took the metro for a few stops  i wanted to visit skytree because of their final fantasy vii remake exhibit on the top floor  but they were shut down  so that was a bummer  but solamachi was a great shopping experience  and the highlight of the morning was going to the  kirby cafe  another themed cafe  fully immersive  i actually enjoyed kirby cafe more than pokemon cafe  but i m more into pokemon such that i d probably revisit that one in the future  afterwards  we travelled to  shinjuku  where we visited  artnia  which is a store and cafe run by  square enix  and walked through the streets of shinjuku towards the  hotel gracery  for a photo of the giant godzilla head  and towards shinjuku station towards  nadaman shinjuku  which is located on the top floor of the  odakyu  department store  i had made reservations for a special kaiseki at nadaman months ago  and it didn t disappoint  thoroughly enjoyed the experience  and it was a great way to end our trip with an excellent view of shinjuku   amp nbsp sunday  departure day  we checked out of our hotel  and caught the airport limousine back to  hnd  quite early  so that we could check out the shops there  the  hnd international terminal  has a shopping area that resembles  loosely  an edo period town  as well as more shopping on the upper level and an observation deck that allows one to watch planes take off quite closely  so we put our luggage in storage for a few hours before having to check in  and yes  i was able to upgrade for this flight as well  so let s just say the entire trip from beginning to end was extremely expensive but highly memorable  checking in  going through security  and immigrations  was super smooth  i had concerns about dealing with the tax free business  because we made a lot of purchases and everything was packed away in our checked luggage  however  we walked up to the tax free counter  and handed over our passports  where all of our receipts were stapled or taped by store staff  the customs agent took a look  whipped out a handy staple remover  and proceeded to carefully remove our receipts and every single staple  thanked us  and returned our passports  super easy  super smooth  in hnd  we got to enjoy the  ana lounge    much nicer than the maple leaf lounge at yyz  definitely seemed overstaffed  but the staff were super attentive without being overbearing  anyways  left tokyo at 6 50  and arrived in toronto at 5 50  same day   amp nbsp lessons for others  and for my future self 1  take the time to rest  it is far better to take a break to enjoy the next day more  than to be forced to be bedridden because you cannot walk anymore 2  get a suica card immediately  we both managed to use up the last of our suica cards with a final small purchase at a conbini in hnd  didn t have to recharge our cards at all  and we started off with ¥10000 each  3  plan  but don t overplan  i personally found it useful to work out every last detail  because i got to know tokyo extremely well before i even arrived  but it drove me a little crazy  that being said  the familiarity allowed me to be very flexibility with our itinerary on the spot  i am already planning a return visit  a much more economical visit  and although i have worked out a shell of an itinerary  i am moreitted to a more casual  flexible schedule  based more around neighbourhoods than specific stores  cafes  restaurants  etc   oh  let s just chill in ueno today 4  don t worry so much about the rail lines  with the help of google maps  and a firm sense of the yamanote line  and a general understanding of how wards in tokyo are organized  i found the rail lines soooooo easy to navigate  by the third or fourth day i didn t even need google maps  and was navigating by platform names and rail line names alone  5  i know everyone says that japan is still very much a cash based society  but this was not so in tokyo  i would imagine that it is more important in more rural areas  but if your trip was based around tokyo  i can t think of one place that i visited that didn t accept foreign credit cards  i d suggest to just make sure you have a chip card  and having tap helps  6  i made a reservation for nadaman  but i now realize that unless you are looking for very specific dining experiences  it is far easier and much more fun to pick restaurants on a whim  don t get me wrong  nadaman was very nice  but 7  location is important  but not critical  making sure your hotel is near a train station is ideal  especially if it s on the yamanote line  ikebukuro was absolutely perfect for us  8  prior to my trip  i watched a lot of videos about food  and thought that all the noise about egg sandwiches at 7 11  family mart  and lawson was just hype  anyways  i decided to try all three  do yourself a favour  unless you have an egg allergy  you need to try these sandwiches  and the strawberry cream sandwiches  and the chicken katsu sandwiches  and the shrimp croquette sandwiches  basically any sandwich in a conbini  oh  and the chicken snacks are amazing  you must also try the hot potato croquettes  okay  anything in a conbini is fair game   amp nbsp final thought  although my entire life is in canada  i fell in love with tokyo  the culture  the cleanliness  the friendliness  the food  the shopping  i could never see myself picking everything up and leaving canada for tokyo  but i will certainly try my darndest to return to tokyo as much as possible  now that i ve gotten one big trip out of the way  i am ready to enjoy japan in quieter  calmer  more economical ways  so i m already planning my next trip back  let s just wait until the current struggle begins to calm down ,1
itinerary check  july august 2021  tokyo   nagano   kansai   hiroshima ,hello all i plan to travel to japan with my father from july 21 to august 5  2021  hopefully  and would love for you to answer my below questions regarding it  or any other critiques you may have  i am aware that this travel is during the tokyo olympics  package is non refundable  and  i ask that readers refrain from any questions orents pertaining to it  other than observations such as  because it ll be during the olympics  because the moderators have made clear to me that those kind of statements belong on the covid 19 discussion board  if you genuinely would like to talk to me about trip affairs in which the olympics are an inseparable element  feel free to pm me please also note that  only our olympic travel  is determined by a touringpany and that the rest ispletely on my father and i  all of our tickets have been confirmed for the postponed dates  and we have paid for a hotel aodation   we just do not know where  my father plans to pay for the entirety of the trip and strongly prefers western hotels over airbnbs and ryokans  and thus  we agreed to stay in one ryokan the entire time   everything else is to be a modern  western style hotel language wise  i speak very basic japanese and my father speaks absolutely none  though i can tell you that my father is much more extroverted than i am and will have a hard time not being able tounicate with japanese people  personally  i may enjoy that  sightseeing wise  my father and i both love history and museums  he is more conservative on gender roles and nudity than i am  so i don t know if he ll like many of the more  youthful  tokyo sights  he s a bit fearful of public transit  but i m certain the shinkansen will blow his mind  in terms of food  i am a gigantic ramen fan but have some sensitivities  very mild  to seafood  this will be my first time in japan and i am very excited amp x200b date city  amp  aodations  flights included here

anything  tragically  wrong about the itinerary  like something we will deeply regret doing or will not succeed in doing  or an essential activity that i totally left out 2  are the given days too packed or too sparse   i ve never done this kind of large scale travel before  and am basing off of itineraries in cities like new york  chicago  and toronto  but filling in based on the amount of sites i wish to see in each city  i m including rest  hopefully in shady areas  because i know that i ll need it  and that it will be hot 3  have i listed anything that is an overrated tourist scam  a boring unimpressive activity  or just not worth doing  or have i missed something that is a must ,1

donki and luxury goods,hi all so i have noticed that a donki in sendai that is near me has an outlet section for g shock and seiko watches  they seem remarkably cheap and once some of the craziness dies down i may look at getting one  i am worried though that they could be fake given their insane discounts  does anyone know if japan has an issue with fakes  are donki s luxury goods actually what they say they are ,1
how is the chinese food in yokohama ,hey all  still in the planning phase of this trip  but i m toying with the idea of visiting yokohama s chinatown  my dad s chinese  born in hong kong  raised in seattle s chinatown  and very much  not  into chinese food that s not cantonese  i ve heard that yokohama is famous for its chinatown  but i m also reading conflicting reports about the tastes of yokohama based chinese food  mostly that even the most high end chinese restaurants  the ones that hire famous hong kong chefs  still tailor their dishes towards a japanese palate which seems to mean that the dishes don t taste very familiar to those who regularly eat cantonese food  conversely  i ve also heard that the street food is more authentic  can anyone shed some light on this  is all chinese food in yokohama going to be  japanicized  much like how we have americanized chinese food in the states  is yokohama s chinatown more of a  ooh  doesn t this look exotic  kind of tourist trap  or are there some bona fide authentic chinese restaurants to be found in yokohama ,1

blatherings on a trip to japan,trip report this ll be long and rambling and utterly pointless  i mean  i think it skirts around the kernel of some ideas  but it never hits them  still  it s something that s not covid related  tl drwent to japan    saw a museum    climbed a mountain   got fat and drunk   visited a castle    visited a shrine   stayed in an inn   bathed in a hot spring   went over a volcano   took a boat ride    visited another castle    wandered around tokyo    bought some shit    realised i m getting older   took a stroll in a garden   got drunk   went home    will go again    but there s more to it than that  multiple posts worth   the holiday in truth began over fifteen months before departure date  with a promise to go to japan  at some stage  during the rugby world cup  it seemed like a good idea at the time  the oulfella was turning sixty and might not be able to travel for much longer  and two weeks in japan seemed an easy ask from work for months i watched the prices of the flights  trying to work out what the budget might be the rwc had an obvious affect  prices were twice as high as they should ve been   to the point of near unnafordability  the irish team was still looking good to go all the way to the finals  and half of dublin 4 was merrily booking out flights  not to mention the english  the welsh  the scottish and the french nobody yet knew what a mess the six nations would be  people were still optimistic i checked prices religiously every morning for nearly three weeks in the office  remarkably  for the final few days before the rwc final   prices dropped back to their sane levels  demand was still high enough to jump the price of a flight by fifty euro from the time i checked in the morning  to the time i got home  with 350 days to departure  we were booked and confirmed with klm they give me four seats on an airplane  for in exchange for 800 hard earned euros per seat  aodation was booked soon after  three nights in the centre of hiroshima  three nights in shinsaibashi  osaka  three nights in hot spring ryokan in sengokuhara  hakone  four nights in shinjuku  tokyo  then home  leave ireland on the 30th of october  arrive on the 13th of november after that  there was only time  and the incessant googling of  days until october 30th  whenever work got tough and i got into the misereable place  at least i could remind myself that i had plans to look forward to  i just had to make it the year ground slow  the clusterfuck of brexit made things steadily more and more expensive  all the hotels were booked in yen  i had time to worry about what i d forgotten  what i d missed and what the fuck could go wrong   the dread sense that everyone s expensive holiday would be ruined and it d be all my fault  little things like insurance and a jr pass are sorted  the last thing i do  is buy some rolls of film and a brand new lens for my eos 650 cameras work changed from tiring and misereable  to busy and tiring  i get warnings for being down  i get praised for picking up months later  two colleagues left  two more joined   and they were still getting themselves to speedwhen people realise you re going away  they want everything done before you go   just in case it might be needed when you re not there  i start to wonder if all i achieved by taking a two week holiday was to make the two weeks before   and two weeks after  a living hell of things to get done  i d deliberately left a single day between the october bank holiday and departure day to wrap things up and take care in handing things over halfway around the world  i d bepletely beyond contact  intentionally so  instead  i m spending two hours crashing together a  basic state of play  email  leaving the office an hour and a half after i meant to  and finishing off a software program that might be needed as soon as i get home  this is the point the oulfella chooses to check if any of his medicines are actually illegal   something i d mentioned months before  in the end  we figure they re probably fine   no stimulants or opiod derivatives the travelling group assembles for the first time our group is meself  the oulfella  the brother and me mate  we are four  the oulfella is past sixty and doing the retirement thing afterpleting his lifetime employment   the strag of the group  the brother podcasts  doesn t drink and works as a tourguide over the summer  and me mate s like me   either winners  or runners up  at the pub quiz at the local anime con this is followed by celebratory pints  a few hours drunken sleep  and an early morning start to the airport celebratory pints are regretted   my head is full of nose goo  early mornings in the airport aren t  the views of the lights out the window are always beautiful  cities need more colour at night like this  we take our places at the checkin line and are are made to remember our place as every single passenger who arrives at the priority line gets served before anyone in the normal the preflight meal is a massive slab of burger from the airport burger king it doesn t kill last night s pints before the morning flight begins boarding  all four members of the travelling party are seated at the back of an embraer 190 aircraft  the seat isfortable  the in flight snacks are tasty and fresh  the view out the window is spectacular  with the sun streaming through the clouds over a darkened dublin city  i snap a well branded shot out the window   while simmering in anticipation of the journey aheadmy head explodes from the change in pressure   especially on the descent  the pain lasts all through schiphol airport  and through the next takeoff the 777 is a larger aircraft  with more space for the legs  and an inflight entertainment system with a gammy jack  but if it can be sat in just the right position to work and it doesn t cause trouble  by the time twelve hours have passed  my head has cleared there is something deeply magical about flying that is too easy to forget these days  siberia rolls past below in darkness  the northern lights are visible off the wing as a dim green glow  it feels adventurous in a way that flying generally doesn t anymore  it s feels like a journey out of a different time  from when flying was an adventure rather than a fussy routine  the aircraft bes afortable home for twelve hours  while we re given dinner  snacks and breakfast narita airport in tokyo greats us with a warmth that does not belong to halloween  customs wees us to the country with fussless efficiency and a stamp in the passort and we are unleashed on japan  being so far from home feels strange jr passes are received while i sweat from the heat  it is perfectly acceptable that i sign for all four passes by myself while everyone waits outside  i appreciate the pragmatism of not having the office clogged up with four weary travellers and their luggage  the ticket agent books our first trip all the way through to hiroshima station from the airport the smallfella gets a local sim   causing a few minutes of hilarity by dropping his own microsim on the floor  he crawls along the floor with the kiosk attendant looking for it  while i worry about missing the train meself and me mate use prepaid esims on our phones   both of us being dualsim  either approach works fine   but i ve me own sim for making phonecalls home  i think having a dual sim phone is a blessing for trips like this the narita express carries us first through fields  and then what feels like an eternal city before we reach tokyo proper  a hikari express carries us to kobe  a sakura trainpletes the trip to hiroshima  a trip of near 1000 kilometres is covered in about 7 hours   allowing for waiting  the shinkansen is a marvel offort and speed  smooth  unobtrusive and meticulously efficient with only the turbine like whine of the motors and the calm voice of the electronic annoucements forpany i m asked why we didn t just crash overnight in tokyo   rather than spend another 8 hours travelling  it seemed logicial at the time   we d basically lose two days to travelling  rather than the one if we did that  and i always wanted to finish in tokyo  rather than racing for the plane across the country it means 30 hours straight of travelling before we make it to hiroshima  night falls far quicker in japanpared to the lingering twilight we get at home home and it s well dark by the time we find our way out of the train station  somehow  the night even seems darker a city bus takes us the few stops from the trainstation to the hotel  you board by the centre door  take a ticket with a number on it  then follow that number on a screen in front of the driver  it tells you what fare to pay when you get off the bus  a distinctly logical system that d never at all work at home  the bus is full of partygoers heading to a halloween celebration  we re too tired to appricate it  maybe we d arrived a day too late to have fun on arrival at our hotel in hiroshima  checkin is quick and painless  i grab a can from the vending machine down the corridor before dozing off  the nightime view out the window is spectacular   a crescent moon looming over the quiet peace park and the shimmering river below  the room isn t spectacular   it s small and old  but it s not bad  not obnoxious and definitely not ufortable or dirty  the aircon works to keep the room cool and dry and the controls are nonplicated  it s a bed  a bathroom and a desk with a television  nothing more is needed  the shower is hot and freshens up after well over 24 hours of solid travelling peopleplain too easy in these days of tripadvisor and yelp  it s like they want to find things wrong  to give themselves more to say  the internet loves misery ,1
how to enjoy food in japan  at all price points  without over optimizing planning ,fellow japan travelers i write to you this morning  looking for guidance on how to enjoy japan   japanese food without driving myself crazy in the planning process  i know i m over planning   over optimizing the food  but i can t stop  i love reading about restaurants  watching vloggers like mark wiens show and explain his favorite places  i love seeing where david chang goes in  ugly delicious  i love reading the trip reports in this sub it s an endless cycle  i love food and travel for food  it is very important to me planning trips to japan  specifically the food portion  is very difficult for me  this uing trip will be my third trip  i was actually supposed to be going to japan yesterday  but covid 19 has postponed my travels   the first time i went to japan was about 6 years ago after i graduated from university  everything was novel and i appreciated the cheapest  most basic fare  sushi zanmai was my favorite lol i went 3 times in 2 days  on my last trip  i found zanmai to be like diner sushi   it is not something i would seek out again last year  i returned as a young professional with disposable ie  i way over researched my food options and was actually very disappointed by an expensive  michelin starred sushiya   sushi shin   for a number of reasons  i am an american tourist and do not have the refined palate of a japanese person  i am not used to many of the tastes and textures of japanese cuisine  i also don t have much experience with shellfish so some of the food was extremely foreign to me  i much  much  much preferred kyubey over sushi shin even though sushi shin is a much more highly regarded restaurant and has a higher rating on tabelog i noticed myself dismissing tripadvisoyelp reviews in favor of tabelog every single time without understanding what i was reading and looking for  now tabelog helped my friends and me immensely when we were looking for a teppanyaki place in kobe  it told us what locals prefer instead of what rich tourists prefer  but i didn t understand what i was after and i found myself disappointed by very expensive japanese cuisine that had a very high bar due to the price let s be honest  tokyo has unreal food and the quality is high at all price points  i find myself trying to juggle cheap  quality eats with higher end  more refined choices while making sure to hit important  and new  food groups cuisines  i m interested in how you all plan the foodponent of your trips some restaurants i m interested in trying on my uing trip sushi araitempura kondoyonekyu  sukiyaki eiki  yakitori yakiniku nakaharaiwa 815  sushi kyourakutei  soba curry bondyginza kagari  ramen ,1
trip report   two weeks   tokyo  osaka  hiroshima  kyoto  kanazawa and takayama   oct nov,hi japantravel   i stumbled across this subreddit some time after this trip and it has slowly be quite the soft spot  travel has always been a huge part of my life and japan in particular is an absolute highlight so  this is my  slightly  delayed trip report from oct nov 2019   i hope this proves to be useful to someone   i started putting this together several weeks ago so i know this might not be the best time to share but i also thought it might also be nice to escape into a little imaginary trip as well i booked planned organised this trip in the span of 5 weeks  as in  we were leaving on oct 30th and i believe we decided to book flights in the last week of september so it was super last minute general travelled to japan with my boyfriend  we are from australia  in our early mid 20s and this was his first trip overseas  i had previously been to japan in 2017 with my mum so already had a good grounding of tokyo and what to expect etc we both absolutely love japanese food and culture and are huge studio ghibli anime fans so this contributed to our itinerary as well day 1   october 30   tokyo landed in tokyo  narita  at around 5 30pm  had already organised a pocket wifi through japan wireless that we were able to pick up from the airport   super easy to do and highly rend i am quite familiar with the higashi shinjuku area and thought this was the perfect introductory location  so we got the keisei skyliner to nippori  transferred to the yamanote line to ikebukuro and then on the fukutoshin line to higashi shinjuku  we also already had organised our pasmo at this stage too got to our airbnb at around 8pm  had a fantastic 7 11 haul for dinner and then wandered around shinjuku until about 10pm  nothing specific  just wanted to get grounded and amaze the boyf with how crazy awesome shinjuku is day 2   october 31st   tokyo  shinjuku  harajuku  shibuya i totally overdid it this day because i was really excited oops walked to cafe aaliya for some nostalgia inducing french toast and coffee  boyfriend said  and still remains adamant  this was the best coffee he s ever had in his life   he got a special blend that was something like ¥800  this cafe will always be a must for me in shinjuku wandered around shinjuku gyoen after this for about an hour and then slowly made our way back towards central shinjuku to browse some stores  bicqlo mainly  and visited some arcades grabbed a super tasty set lunch on the restaurant floor of lumine est before we made our way to harajuku wandered through meiji jingu to takeshita street and omotesando  harajuku has such good vibes and we really just enjoyed taking our time looking at anything that caught our interest  also took a really nice walk down cat street to head towards shibuya just as the sun was setting so it was a nice calm departure from takeshita spent some time in shibuya mainly eyeing off all the crazy halloween costumes  halloween in aus is somewhat nonexistent  and the mega don quijote  headed back to the airbnb after this and grabbed some mcdonalds for dinner before absolutely crashing after enduring 30 000 steps  as i said  oops day 3   november 1st   tokyo akihabara  yokohama slept in a little  had some fruit yoghurt cereal at the airbnb and made our way to shinjuku station to exchange our jr passes  only to realise  after a mild freak out  that my exchange order had been left in the photocopier back in australia  i died immediately   but all is good  i was able to purchase a new one  the full price i paid in japan    712  still worked out cheaper than purchasing all of my train tickets individually and i was able to get a refund from klook as the original exchange order had not been filled  semi win made our way to akihabara and immediately purchased a cheese tart from pablo   instantly felt better  wandered around akihabara  hitting up a fair share of anime figure stores and visited the gachapon hall before heading over to yodabashi camera  we ended up having lunch on the restaurant floor of yodabashi  boyf got an absolute monster of a curry and i snagged a delicious set lunch with mackerel  miso  rice and salad we decided to head back to our airbnb and have a little rest before making our way to yokohama for the evening  we both really wanted to visit the cup noodle museum and there was quite a big rugby world cup fanzone that we also wanted to check out yokohama was the absolute best surprise  it was really nice exploring a little outside of tokyo and we even made it to china town which we also enjoyed  especially after the stressful morning haha  i definitely think we would return here again day 4   november 2nd   tokyo to osaka  shinjuku  dotonburi checked out of our airbnb pretty early as we could leave luggage there and utilised our morning by wandering around shinjuku  browsing some more stores and then heading to the tokyo metropolitan government building  we had to wait for about 25 minutes before getting up to the top but  for free  it is so worth it  especially seeing yoyogi park and just the entire expanse of tokyo  truly crazy rushed back to the airbnb to grab luggage and made our way to shinagawa station to catch the shinkansen to osaka  once we got to the station  we found our platform and i raced to get some bento  fortunately  we were able to reserve seats the day before and were able to view mt fuji on the journey  which was cool  excitedly played some switch for a few hours before getting into osaka as soon as we arrived in osaka we instantly felt the change of pace   everything just seemed a lot more relaxed our next airbnb was located near ebisucho station  it s not the  nicest  area in osaka  but we felt like it was fine  especially because our apartment was huge  we relaxed for an hour or so before heading into dotonburi to grab some dinner dotonburi is just delightful  honestly can say that we just had the best time wandering and eating and wandering  we stumbled upon hozenji yokocho  which was so quaint and just did a lot of ogling at the food  food consumed  takoyaki  gyoza  melon pan day 5   november 3rd   osaka  kaiyukan  kita  nakazakicho aquarium time i like aquariums  we went early  the kaiyukan aquarium was fantastic  we got there just after it opened after picking up some coffee snacks breakfast on the way and spent a solid 2 hours there  we actually bought the osaka kaiyu ticket at ebisucho station as this gave us entrance to the aquarium and unlimited travel on the osaka metro plus it meant no lining up when we arrived explored the area after we finished at the aquarium and then made our way to kita district for some sushi train and shake shack  struck gold here with this find  we then wandered through all the thrift stores and back streets in the area until we slowly made our way to the osaka museum of housing and living  this was a nice experience and i am glad we made the effort to check it out took some time this afternoon to do some washing organising etc  and then we headed back to dotonburi for dinner  decided to try mizuno for their okonomiyaki and it was well worth the hour wait  we spent the remainder of our night roaming through the namba area and forcing boyfriend to get purikura  he loved it day 6  november 4th   osaka  castle area  den den town  america mura  shinsaibashi headed to osaka castle first up  we probably spent over an hour wandering the grounds and exploring the inside of the castle  there is a really nice view from the top too  circled back around the grounds and then went to gram pancakes for a late brunch   we were slightly disappointed made our way to den den town with great anticipation  this was such a fun afternoon as we just aimlessly wandered in and out of arcades  retro game stores  anime stores etc  i also got a sweet potato yam filled taiyaki and it was so tasty  this area was just jam packed with so much to see and do  it felt like a less refined and modern akihabara  we loved it after a quick nap break conbini feast  we headed to america mura  this was a really awesome district and if we had more time i would have loved to spend it here but alas  we were on a deadline  for the pokemon cafe  i was able to snag tickets for dinner at the newly opened pokemon cafe in shinsaibashi  we are both pretty big pokemon enthusiasts and the whole experience was just really cool  and  to top it off  after 6 days of tracking down a very specific gachapon  we located it at the jump shop across from the pokemon center  wins all round i also had to have more dotonburi takoyaki so we headed back that way through shinsaibashi suji and i inhaled my octopus balls like no tomorrow  lol  oh and more melon pan  obviously day 7   november 5th   osaka to hiroshima  peace memorial park  shukkei en garden  hiroshima castle we got an early train to hiroshima  armed with some breakfast bento and arrived by mid morning  took the tram to our hotel and dropped our bags before making our way to peace memorial park we walked from our hotel to peace memorial park as it was only  15 minutes and i am so glad we did  this gave us an instant insight into hiroshima s vibe ing from brisbane  which can beonly known as a large country esque town  hiroshima almost felt familiar  it wasn t loud  it wasn t boisterous  it was just really calm and peaceful the peace memorial park was such a significant experience  as we were making our way through the park  we reached the children s peace monument and there was a group of school children singing in front of it  and my gosh  all the emotions just hit hard  it really drove home the devastating loss of life that occurred in the city we then visited the peace memorial museum  i would highly rend adding this to your schedule as the museum itself has been very well curated  it is sad  but it also highly insightful and reflective we made our way through downtown hiroshima  grabbed some ichiran ramen for lunch and explored hon dori shotengai on the way back to the hotel to check in  we stumbled upon a store in hondori street with 100s of gachapon as well  with a huge selection we hadn t seen before too we utilised the rest of the afternoon heading to shukkei en garden  which was awesome  as far as japanese gardens go  this one was top notch  we also made the effort to walk to hiroshima castle  which was also a nice stroll we made our way back to the hotel and consciously decided to have a quiet night   we definitely needed to recuperate  ended up going on a stroll later on to scout out some dinner but we both weren t feeling 100  so decided some sandwiches and fruit from lawson was our best bet day 8   november 6th   hiroshima to kyoto  miyajima island itsukushima shrine  mount misen to miyajima after a quick breakfast we made our way to miyajima island   from hiroshima you can take the jr line to miyajimaguchi station and then hop on the jr ferry  this takes  45 minutes  i was incredibly excited to visit miyajima to see the floating torii gate  but  on the ferry to the island we soon realised the gate was undergoing some renovation works and waspletely covered up  sad face  honestly  i had looked up a few other things to do on miyajima but this was our big draw card and i guess the lack of my timely research did not prepare us for this feeling slightly defeated we decided to make the most of our day and explore as much as miyajima as we could and honestly  this day was just the best  after we got off the ferry we made our way to itsukushima shrine  and even though the torii gate was covered in cladding  the shrine itself was still worth the visit  we made our way up to daishoin  which is just an incredible buddhist templeplex   there s a lot to see and explore here and we had a lot of fun wandering through the many halls we descended back down to the  centre  of town to look at some stores and grab some lunch   there s quite a lot of street food on offer but be careful if any deer are around  they wille for you  we decided to try abination of pork buns  beef buns  chicken yakitori and octopus yakitori from a few different vendors and it was all just so good we still had some time up our sleeve so decided to take the miyajima ropeway up to mount misen and the shishiiwa observatory  i also decided  on the limited time we had left  to make the trek to the mount misen observatory as well  though incredible  and well worth the crazy fast walk  we basically only had time to make it to the observatory and turn around again  so  i would rend to set at least 2 hours aside to ascend and descend mount misen if you d like to trek to the further observatory   this would give you that extra time to just rest and really appreciate the incredible view  also factor in the time the ropeway closes  i believe the latest time to return was  5pm we made our way back through the centre  picked up some momiji cakes  headed back to hiroshima  grabbed some bento for dinner and then made our way to kyoto  we basically crashed as soon as we checked in that night  so nothing exciting to report day 9   november 7th   kyoto  southern higashiyama  gion  kiyomizu we ventured to eggs  n  things for a late breakfast before kickstarting our temple tour  we had a quick look in tokyu hands and the pokemon centre before grabbing the metro from karasuma station to higashiyama station  i had stumbled across a kyoto itinerary which included a walking route   we followed this route to visit  shoren in  chion in  maruyama park  yasaka jinja  higashi otani cemetery  kodai ji  and ishibei koji street we took a small break at this point to grab a coffee from   arabica  which was fantastic  and then continued uphill via ninen zaka street and sannen zaka street  i also bought a matcha tiramisu from maccha house that i still dream about it to this day  there were also quite a few stores stocking studio ghibli so we spent some time browsing  we continued to follow the crowds all the way to kiyomizu dera and spent some time on the temple grounds  there s a wonderful view of the city from here  i would say this whole walk took us about 4 hours  but that s only because we took it pretty slow  we definitely weren t in a rush i probably should add that the higashiyama area is where you will find the absolutely beautiful historic buildings that kyoto is famous for  but be prepared for large crowds in small spaces i also should add that it can be quite difficult getting transport from kiyomizu dera back into the city centre  if you aren t staying in the gion district  but  we just decided to walk back to our hotel   it was about 3km and we passed through gion  kamo river and the downtown area  so it was a really great choice as it ate up a fair chunk of the rest of our day and gave us heaps of unstructured time to just explore day 10  november 8th   kyoto  arashiyama  nishiki market  downtown kyoto we got moving a bit earlier on this day to make it to arashiyama by 9 30  walked through the temple grounds of tenryu ji and then made our way to the bamboo groves  there is quite a lot more to see and do around arashiyama  sagano railway  okochi sanso villa  and i wish i had set some more time aside for this but we were pretty focussed on keeping it simple and not rushing around  i would like to go back here though after picking up a strawberry mochi  yum  we made our way to the iwatayama monkey park  we had a lot of fun here just watching all the monkeys roam about  plus the view of arashiyama kyoto is awesome  probably should add that it takes 25  minutes to ascend as it is on the mountainside  definitely not an  easy  stroll to get there made our way back to kyoto via train to visit nishiki market  i got some garlic butter scallops and mitarashi dango as we were walking through  10 10  picked up some bakery items from paul bocuse in daimaru to take back to the hotel as we desperately needed to do some laundry with some life admin sorted we ventured back out into the  downtown  district  wandered through teramachi street  visited a few arcades  continued our gacha hunt and made our way to pontocho alley  i really loved walking through this area  we even passed a geisha   which i was secretly hoping for but not expecting at all i had made reservations for kichi kichi that night and the whole experience was fantastic  the staff are so friendly  and chef yukimura motokichi was exactly what we expected   his theatrics and passion were wonderful  boyf got the omurice and i got the ox tongue stew  incredible food but portions aren t overly large ended the night with melon pan  because why not day 11   november 9th   kyoto  fushimi inari  kyoto station planned to head to fushimi inari as early as possible but transport was a lot busier than we expected  maybe because it was a saturday  so ended up arriving around 9 30  we spent a good 2 hours here  making our way up mount inari and descending at our own pace  even though the first 15 20 minutes was quite busy  once we hit the hiking trail the crowds dispersed almost immediately so we were still able to get some good photos we headed back to kyoto station and explored the observation deck before making our way towards the district surrounding kyoto tower  explored yodobashi  took advantage of the massage chairs and ate on the restaurant floor  this was hands down one of our favourite meals although totally unexpected  which made it even better  i had oyakodon and boyf had a katsu curry we spent the rest of the afternoon relaxing  re visiting tokyu hands and the pokemon centre  and just wandering through downtown more   we really enjoyed just walking around kyoto  we went to miyabi an for shabu shabu and boyf was absolutely obsessed with this whole entire experience  i just loved being able to cook everything ourselves plus the choice of side dishes was incredible day 12   november 10th   kyoto to kanazawa  kenrokuen  kanazawa castle  10 10 food with the previous day a bit hectic in the morning with transport we decided to get a taxi to kyoto station from our hotel and i am so glad we did this   it cost  ¥1200 and the added convenience validated this decision  we picked up some breakfast from kyoto station before jumping on our train at 9am bound for kanazawa we arrived in kanazawa at  11 30am  caught the bus to our hotel and were able to leave our luggage to explore  we headed straight for kenroukuen gardens from our hotel  these gardens are next level  i would say we spent at least 1 5 hours roaming these gardens  they are beautiful  immaculate  incredible   just a 10 10 experience we took the exit out of the gardens closest to kanazawa castle and grabbed some lunch at a nearby cafe  once again  we were unexpectedly blown away by this meal   i ordered the omurice and ended up with sashimi  pickled vegetables  potato salad  miso   rice and freshly squeezed orange juice and man it was just too good  so  if you end up in kanazawa  check out kissa hakucho the rest of the day was spent leisurely exploring the castle park and the contemporary art museum  both were super nice we also couldn t resist some shopping arcade fun   this was the first time we both were bold enough to try taiko no tatsujin  the taiko drum game  and it was just so great  we both got a bit confident and thought we could tackle a harder song and failed spectacularly one thing i wanted to add about kanazawa is the slowed pace that is present here  i felt like no one was in a rush and everything happened a bit slower than usual  it was nice day 13   november 11th   kanezawa to takayama  ryokan  higashiyama walking course to takayama we arrived in takayama at around 11 30am and made our way to our ryokan  the boyf had no idea i had organised a ryokan but was really ecstatic we could experience one the weather was much cooler in takayama which made our huge exploration a bit more pleasant haha  we set out towards the historical quarter  which was so incredibly delightful  i truly felt like i was transported back in time  grabbed lunch from center 4 hamburgers  which was amazing  after this we just aimlessly strolled towards the sakurayama hachimangu shrine and slowly made our way towards kyushoji temple which marked the starting point of takayama s higashiyama walking course  i would highly rend this walk  there s heaps of signs directing you on where to go and you get to see some beautiful shrines and temples on the way  it was also peak fall foliage season so everything was just speckled in reds and oranges takayama was just so calm and chill  we had the best time wandering and exploring anything that piqued our interest   our ryokan was fantastic  the staff were incredibly kind and weing and i am so glad i included this in our trip   day 14   november 12th   takayama to tokyo  takayama morning market  akihabara kickstarted the day with a traditional japanese breakfast at our ryokan which just really rounded out the experience with some time to kill we decided to visit the takayama morning market   it was a little quiet but the stores surrounding the markets were great this was our biggest travel day  i think about 4  hours on trains from takayama to toyama and then toyama to tokyo  so a whole chunk of this was spent playing switch on return to tokyo we stayed in the nihonbashi area  just for something different  our closest station was ningyocho which provided access to the asakusa and hibiya lines spent the rest of the night back in akihabara exploring various anime related stores  shopping in yodabashi and eating coco s curry  although a chain  we became obsessed after this one dinner day 15   november 13th   tokyo  odaiba  teamlab borderless  venus fort  ikebukaro  shinjuku second last day   a lot to do  panic ensue we headed to odaiba early ish to grab breakfast at eggs  n things at the shinbashi shiodome   their iced coffees are really nice imo  we also discovered a pokemon vending machine as we were leaving in which you could order a mystery poke ball  cool right  boyf got mareep lol and i got pichu  just fyi walked to teamlab borderless from here and it was  10 30am when we arrived  it wasn t crazy packed but there was a sizeable crowd there  i would say we spent a good 1 5   2 hours here  thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience and i would 100  check out planets next time spent some time in venus fort  cool european themed shopping centre with a huge array of stores made our way to ikebukaro to visit sunshine city and surrounds  got coco s curry  again  stumbled across a newer release of the gachapon we were hunting and managed to get all 6  spent the rest of the afternoon trying to hunt taiko drums for switch  no dice we really enjoyed ikebukaro  it felt like perfectbination of shinjuku and akihabara and i would definitely stay in this area the remainder of our evening was spent catching up with friends for diy okonomiyaki restaurant in shinjuku  visiting a pachinko parlour and dying over strong zero 20 10 day day 15   november 14th   tokyo  tokyo station  skytree  asakusa  ginza premise   our flight was at  9pm so we could aplish quite a lot got to tokyo station early to store our luggage  grabbed a quick breakfast and spent some time in character street  really cool basement level in the station for anime character goods decided  on the last day  we wanted to collect all og starter pokemon in their  fluffy  version  walked to the tokyo dx pokemon center and was able to get charmander and bulbasaur  soon realised that getting squirtle was now a priority decided to head to skytree  i really enjoyed this area when i was previously in japan and wanted to show boyf  to visit the pokemon center there  no squirtle made our way to asakusa to see sens ji and nakamise dori  got a bad fortune headed to ginza for a wander  grabbed a really nice set lunch at minori cafe which sits on the upper terrace of mitsukoshi quickly did some shopping at tokyu hands and bic   last minute gifts etc wandered back towards tokyo station via the marunouchi side   it s just so so pretty we got the narita express to the airport  traded our pasmo cards back in for some cash  checked in and then had to check the pokemon center  once again  no squirtle  and with that  dreams were crushed  much sadness pro tip about narita departures   all of the really nice food is located before you go through security so if you were planning one last tasty meal then you ll want to grab this before you go through security explored the terminal  wandered toward our gate and decided that i wanted to grab a few small things for family  lo and behold there was a lonely fluffy squirtle in one of the stores and i could purchase him with the cash we got back from our pasmo  happiness peak reached fin if you have any questions please feel free to ask away  notes  our pocket wifi was the best investment  it was incredibly fast and reliable and ensured that we could play pokemon go at all times  oh and find our way around  of course  we ordered this through japan wireless  we both really enjoy walking  and we also got really lucky with the weather  most days varied between 15 24 c  which greatly contributed to choosing to walk more  gachapon are addicting  tracking down a full set of gachapon became more of a need than a want haha  restaurant floors in department stores are a general lifesaver   usually will always have a set lunch on offer  includes miso  rice  salad  drink with meal  and are just so tasty  also  on food  don t underestimate how fantastic the convenience stores are  we tried so many things and did not once feel as if we were skimping on going to a  proper  restaurant  the food quality is extraordinary and the novelty with trying something new never wore out  reserving our seats for the shinkansen really helped put our mind at ease  there was only one train we couldn t reserve seats on as it was fully booked  this was from osaka   hiroshima  our pasmo worked everywhere we travelled  unless the mode of transport only accepted cash coins  japan seems to be doing a huge overhaul of restoration works on some pretty major sites before the  now delayed  olympics   this was a surprise to us as a few sites had longer waits could not be viewed  this included the tokyo met building and the torii gate of itsukushima shrine ,1
how long is the sakura themed food drink available for ,i ve bought this amazing sakura latte powder about 2 weeks ago while traveling and i regret not buying 10 so much  i m thinking of visiting japan next year  but probably in may  june so not sure if that would still be found in shops thanks in advance,1
does ikebukuro station close ,pretty simple question  when i was last in ikebukuro  i didn t much care for the underpass  we rd  to get from the east side to the west side of ikebukuro  so it occurred to me to consider  if i were  for example  finishing up the night at a game centre on the east side  and then returning to a hotel on the west side  could i walk through the ikebukuro station underground even though train service has ended ,1
how do i know which anime themed cafes will be happening this year ,i m hoping to go to japan sometime this fall or winter  and i want to check out a few cafes  however whenever i try looking up cafes for this year  i m only given cafes that are only open for spring or already ended  is there a website that has anime themed cafes for all of 2020 or will i only know what themes will be out the closer i get to my travel date ,1
who else is postponing their trip till next spring ,part of my concern postponing my honeymoon in until next spring is the number of people going  we are already concerned with the number of people during cherry blossoms but if we go next spring  we think everyone who would have went this spring is now going next spring too   thoughts ,1
ana airlines praise,through all the recent events of cancelled flights  uncertain travel terms and people world wide needing to cancel or update plans   many who have been unsuccessful in obtaining full refunds or credits  i just wanted to praise ana for their response during these times  we were booked via an agent on the cheapest airfare possible  ana rather than deflecting us to the travel agent we couldn t get in touch with offered an upfront full refund  not credit  however at the time we still decided to fly out  once in japan we had 6 amazing nights before our home country demanded people return home immediately  again after failing to get in touch with our travel agent we were able to talk to ana at haneda and they were able to change our return flights with no issues or hassles for no extra charge   they even asked which seats we would prefer i hope that when the world returns to normal and we are all traveling again  that we make an effort to choose airlines that put the customer first and go above and beyond  i just wish my own countries major carrier  qantas  had done similar  but my friends were not so lucky dealing with them ,1
trip report 8   23 mar 2020  tokyo nikko takayama kyoto,good day i  just recently came back from japan  due to recent situation  i d like to share my experiences over there  this was my 3rd trip to japan  i ve done most of the tourist spots before and this trip was meant to relax and wander around  we initially planned this back in dec 19 for three of us and the other two bailed out on me at the end and i decided to go ahead with the trip myself  my flight to tokyo from melbourne was very empty  rough count prob less than half the plane  everyone seems to be placed as not close proximity to each other  i had window seat and had nobody next to me  if you get middle 4 row well your luck  you could lay down  day 1   3 tokyoi stayed at zen hotel  saw it in youtube  pretty nice and affordable as well  hotel was very empty  on 1st day only one person on the floor  2nd day i was by myself on the 4th floor  3rd day had another couple  teamlab was my most wanted destination this time but since it was closed i ended up wandering in odaiba area  tsukiji asakusa akihabara  amp  ginza  most places were pretty quiet with no tourists  however  most shops were open  tsukiji was pretty empty  not that many customers but still quite a few there  akihabara are still stacked  saw a lot of ff7 remake promotions in big stores  you could see most  say 7 10  wear masks especially in public transport  outside public transport  perhaps 5 10  can t find masks anywhere in tokyo during my time  day 4   5 nikkowent to nikko on tobu line from asakusa  toshogu shrine was a beauty  actually saw a lot of visitors there  also went to kinugawa onsen area and had a nice relaxing bath in one of the hotel  my hotel was next to big supermarket  scored nice meals at night when they were put to huge discount    day 6   8 takayamatook a 5 hr bus trip from shinjuku to takayama with only 4 people in a bus  trip was fine  bus stops like every 1 5 hr  the following day went to okuhida region for shin hotaka ropeway  was looking forward to this but ended in disappointment  was snowing  amp  raining  at the top barely see anything other than white landscape all over  ended up back to hirayu onsen and had another great bath  went to shirakawa go  this time was a perfect day  sunny  you could see the whole village from the observation place  came back and explore takayama area  had hidagyu twice  at maruaki  amp  matsukiushi   and really enjoyed it  it s priced decently too  tried takayama ramen but didn t really like it  day 9 kanazawatook a train up north and see the city  saw the market and kenrokuen garden which is good but nothing blooms there  other than those two  didn t see much and it was raining partly throughout the day too  day 10   13 kyototook early morning train and went to arashiyama area  had my best meal murasawa beef steak set at otsuka steak  it s actually a bit pricey but once in a while i guess it s ok  to my surprise  lots of people in arashiyama area  not sure tourists or not  the monkey park is awesome  really enjoy it but man it took a while to go up there  turns out i m not that fit  also did sagami scenic train  didn t do boat cruise as it takes 2 hours  and i think my back would not stand for 2 hrs on a small wooden boat  bamboo grove at the end  golden pavilion and silver pavilion then down to gion area on the following day  the golden one is great but the silver one feels so inferior  took a train to osaka for day trip  saw umeda shopping area then area outside of osaka castle then to dotonbori area  i actually found few masks sanitiser on osaka area so bought a few the morning i got a nasty surprise that my jal plane back to melbourne been cancelled rescheduled  bit of panic started to kick in  so i decided to cut short my stay in kyoto by 1 day and quickly head back to tokyo as jal office is only in tokyo  day 14   16 back to tokyothis was time when restrictions started ramping up  sorted out my ticket  they rescheduled it on the night same day via sydney instead of morning direct flight to melbourne  they verbally said that this flight will be definitely on which calmed me down a bit   by this time i just did my shopping to bring stuffs home  got some sanitiser and masks to bring home  by now family started to spam me with bad news back home that i need to get back now and said about food shortage  rode a nex to airport with only 3 people in a cart  airport was so empty  felt so weird  you look at the big departure board and saw 95  of them in red cancelled  finally  felt mixed emotion on boarding the plane  one hand you are able to go home albeit with lots of lock downs  amp  restrictions pared to some who are stranded elsewhere  but on the other hand  you are leaving a place which on the surface looks fine as if outbreaks didn t happen  overall  i really enjoyed this trip  everything i did was slow pace  strolling here and there unlike both of my previous trips to japan where itinerary was so packed and you exhaust yourselves covering lots of grounds on daily basis  though deep down i still had little bit of worries and what ifs    final thoughts  i honestly still don t get it how well japan so far handling the outbreaks  the confirmed cases don t go up at rapid ratepared to other countries  yes  in most public places  you could find free sanitiser galore  i lost count how many times i rub alcohol to my hands in a day  all shops are open though not many customers  food seem to be in abundance  economy slows down a lot but it s still movingpared to back in australia  trains were restricted but didn t feel it at all  shinkansen still popped out every 15m  local trains still ran efficiently  i didn t even bother chasing one  just wait for next one in 5m  i am now on mandatory 14 days self isolation  i felt fine and no issues at all  currently it s day 4  don t have that many food at home though and had to rely on my cousins to send me some groceries  due to closure of some of popular destinations  i guess i still need to go back japan  looking forward when things settle down and hopefully have the chance to go again  it s such amazing country  missed the 7 11  family mart and vending machines already  i do apologise for long wall of texts  hopefully things settle down quickly and we can go back to a beautiful country again ,1

3 week solo trip report  jan 17   feb 18  tokyo  kyoto  nara  kanazawa  nagoya  tokyo  pt  ii,pt  1  tokyo  kyoto  nara   here feb 8 nara deer park  the deer are very demanding of the crackers  and very easily annoyed if they think you re holding out on them  like iwatayama  i was happy that the deer enjoy a great deal of freedom to walk around and do what they want  even if they can be dicks  saw lots of people attempting selfies with the deer or trying to pet them like dogs and getting head butted  don t take their  tameness  too seriously if you go   they re wild animals  i had a great time and spent the better part of my day just wandering around  watching the deer and taking pictures  i know there s so much more to do in nara  and am definitely planning a much longer stay there on my next visit first cabin kanazawa  the rest of my day was eaten up by travel as i took two trains up to kanazawa and skipped the daunting prospect of buses in the dark to walk from kanazawa station to my first cabin capsule hotel  first cabin was quite nice  actually  and didn t strictly enforce the  kick out  rule like other capsule hotels  plus  there was a very solid onsen and sauna on their basement floor  highly rend if you re looking at budget stays in kanazawa jazz spot bokunen  dark  hip  quiet little vinyl jazz bar that got pretty busy over the course of the evening  i wanted a break from strictly japanese food  so i ordered their pizza for dinner  along with a highball  after i d ordered  i saw some folks get a curry dish sent out to them and knew i d made the wrong choice  pizza was fine  but that curry looked amazing  still  a nice  lively spot to unwind with a drink after a long travel day  had a relaxing soak in the first cabin onsen before hitting the hay feb 9 kenrokuen garden  i got incredibly lucky and woke up to a beautiful snowy day   perfect for a visit to one of japan s most beautiful gardens  the gardens were breathtaking in the snow  i can t imagine how gorgeous they must be in the springtime  and i spent my whole morning wandering around the grounds  taking pictures  and generally being dazzled ippudo ramen  after getting frozen walking around in the snow  i wanted a cozy ramen lunch  they had an english menu ready to go  sat me super fast  and delivered an incredibly tasty spicy ramen   perfect for the weather  super satisfying and pleasant ramen experience shopping  central kanazawa has a few great shopping streets dotted with solid vintage places  young trendy stuff  small specialty stores  and some big retailers like  tokyu hands  it kept snowing on and off through the afternoon  so i just wandered and popped into whatever looked interesting  i d been admiring the layered styles i kept seeing on the youths  so i snapped up a few cute pieces from  spinns kanazawa music bar  i d been reading about this place and was pretty excited about it  but unfortunately it was almostpletely dead the night i went  the bartender was super nice  and my g amp ts were fantastic  but i wasn t super impressed by the bouillabaisse chef s special i ordered for dinner  still  a beautiful spot with a talented bar staff  i m sure it s fun when it s a little more lively furansu cocktail bar  definitely my favorite bar of the kanazawa leg of my trip  furansu is owned by two brothers who moved from france to open it just a few years ago  the younger brother was a little more personable at first  but the older brother opened right up once we started talking aboutics  cartoons  and anime  i was starting to feel a little isolated at this point in my solo trip  so it was really nice to have a long chat and hear their take on life in japan as french ex pats  they also make a stellar g amp t feb 10  i hit a homesick patch on day 13  it kind of threw me for a loop and i almost talked myself into spending the whole day eating konbini snacks and listening to podcasts in my capsule  i m glad i pushed myself to go out  but the whole thing put a damper on my morning and i didn t get moving until lunchtime  i m not sure how i would ve handled it differently  but i wish i d anticipated it i guess  something maybe to be aware of if you re planning on being a solo traveler on an extended trip with limited japanese  like i was kourin sushi  stumbled upon this place after getting on the wrong bus  again  and grumpily trudging around the city for half an hour trying to figure out what to do  kourin is very proud of their foreigner friendliness and eating at such a delicious and aodating spot did a lot to lift my spirits  the sushi was excellent  and kourin filled up with locals at lunchtime  they were playing some japanese daytime tv at the bar that everyone was kind of half watching  and it lent a really nice  laid back vibe to the place ishikawa prefectural museum of traditional arts and crafts  this museum is actually on the kenrokuen grounds  so i got to take a second spin around the garden  nowpletely green after the quick snow melt  the museum itself is wonderful  the prefecture specializes in so many different crafts  from silk to carved lions head masks to special candles to lacquerware  the examples they have on display are beautiful  and the descriptions of how some are made are really well done  plus there s an awesome gift shop if you want to take some of the local specialties home  not the biggest museum  but well worth a look craft beer dive futa s  i got here a little early in the day  and was the only patron for most of my visit  but the beer was great  and it s in a very cool little nook of town  surrounded by interesting looking vintage shops and watering holes  despite the name  futa s isn t terribly  divey  imo  but it s very chill inside and the man makes a fantastic gyoza still feeling a little down  i decided not to push myself into another  activity  but instead did a little more shopping on my way back to first cabin and enjoyed having the onsen all to myself before turning in early feb 11  full disclosure  i walked into the  21st century museum  and it was absolutely packed due to a national holiday that i should ve known about  beyond that  the directions for where to get tickets to certain exhibits were unclear  it was kind of pricey  and i just didn t have a good feeling about it  so i bailed  will give it another go next time i m in kanazawa kanazawa noh museum  definitely rend this if you re in kanazawa and have an interest in noh  it s not huge  but the pieces they have on display  plus performances being screened around the space  are amazing  and they have a full noh costume on hand that you can put on to feel what it s like to move around in all the layers and the mask  the noh museum operates as an arm of the 21st century museum  and i think you can get abo ticket if you do both dt suzuki museum  really enjoyed this  but maybe not for everyone  suzuki had an amazing life as a scholar of zen buddhism  and the museum is designed to reflect the zen tenants of meditation and focus on the present moment  the experience is almost more about your presence in the space than anything else  it was beautiful and unlike any other museum i ve been to kanazawa international exchange salon  totally stumbled upon this while walking to find lunch  it s a gorgeous traditional style home with tatami mats  sliding screens  and a beautiful garden that you can just let yourself into and tour for free  it sounds like they have some rotating displays   there was a hinamatsuri doll set on view when i visited aashirwad  fantastic indian restaurant along one of the main shopping streets  i had the veggie curry with naan  everything was sooooo goood  they were so friendly  and it was nice to have a meal with a distinctly different flavor profile than most of what i d been eating higashi chaya  i just did a casual wander through this historic neighborhood  took pictures  popped into a few artisan shops  and bought an indigo dyed coin purse  really beautiful part of the city nine hours nagoya station  took the train to nagoya and checked in at nine hours a few blocks away from nagoya station  i made sure to ask at check in if i would be able to sit in the cafe on the bottom floor to work on my laptop after daily check out time  they assured me i would  this would later prove to be false  otherwise  nine hours was very clean fortable  and convenient to the station yamachan  nagoya s famous wing centric local chain  they serve a few different nagoya specialties but are best known for their dry rub chicken wings  which are so salty and yummy  they also serve a local beer on tap  and there are a million of them around nagoya  i actually got turned away from the first one i tried because it was so busy  and was able to walk to a different one basically across the street from the first  english translations on the menu  patrons seemed to be jovial packs of friends catching up after work  loved it y market brewing  i enjoyed the beer here but it was kind of an odd vibe  just a little bit stiff  no one was impolite per se  i just felt a little rushed watched  i might ve enjoyed it more if i d had a friend to chat with  the space wasn t very distinctive   reminded me of lots of breweries at home  good beer though feb 12   nagoya station  and  takashimaya  there are a million shops and eateries in and around nagoya station  so i spent my morning just wandering around and browsing  also grabbed some stamps for postcards from the station s post office yamamotoya honten  another nagoya chain  famous for its miso nikomi udon  no english  so i just pointed at what appeared to be the special  different flavors here than a typical udon  but really yummy  and you get bottomless pickles with your meal  guests were mostly businessmen having lunch  and one old guy who helped to fetch me a bib because i kept getting broth on myself while slurping  this was a little intimidating but i m so glad i checked it out osu kannon  super eclectic shopping district right against a buddhist shrine  there s a ton to see  eat  and buy here  i spent the most time in this amazing vintage store called  small change nigiri no tokube  can t rend this kaitenzushi place enough if you re in nagoya  it s in a sunken courtyard at the oasis 21 bus station  so a bit hidden  amazing quality for the price  tablets with an english option to order  and one of the most friendly waitresses of my entire trip  who was so eager to show me how everything works  you can stuff yourself with sushi for cheap and they have great seasonal options on the menu craft beer keg nagoya  good beer selection  but this was also really slow while i was there  two older businessmen showed up while i was enjoying my beers  but it was quiet otherwise  not a bad spot if you re looking for an intimate space to have a japanese beer hub  i was getting so desperate for english conversation that i decided to check out one of the two nagoya hubs  a friend from the area told me later that i d probably gone to the more skeevy of the two  there was an old white guy in a sweater vest sitting in the middle of the front room smoking a cigar and generally looking kind of predatory  and two other guys loudly discussing british and american politics on the front patio  i had a couple guinnesses and ultimately left without making any conversation feb 13  got kicked out of my nine hours  apparently an hour and a half after checkout was my limit for hanging out in the ground floor cafe  which i wish they d been clear about when i asked  i drank a konbini coffee while i was working  instead of buying an egregiously expensive one from the cafe  so maybe that was an issue  the manager that kicked me out was the same one that had told me i d be able to stay  and he seemed a bit sheepish about going back on his word  but kicked me out all the same  to anyone that might be a late sleeper or might be planning on working from your lodgings  and are thinking about one of these budget stays  make sure you re very clear on their kick out policies  definitely felt like i was misled by the manager and will probably not stay at a nine hours again  had to scramble over to the starbucks at nagoya station to finish what i was working on pizzaria cesari  tucked into the osu shopping district  this spot cranks out neapolitan style pizzas by a world class pizza chef  i got a margherita and it was indeed world class  a must if you re a pizza person  who isn t a pizza person nagoya castle and hommaru palace  some parts of the castle were inaccessible due to construction  but hommaru palace was open for tours and was amazing  it was a nicepliment to nijo jo castle  because the elaborate wall paintings had been recently re created by artists  as opposed to being the preserved originals that you see at nijo jo  so photographs are allowed  the grounds open to explore were beautiful  with amazing views of the castle exterior  i really enjoyed the blooming plum trees went out of my way to try and check out  hopbuds  i showed up right at opening time  according to google  waited 15 minutes for someone to unlock the door or turn some lights on  and nothing happened  no signs indicating an unexpected closure  based on reviews  it sounded cool  wish i d been able to give it a try teshigoto ya  stumbled upon this on my way back to nine hours  just a casual izakaya also focusing on nagoya specialties  nothing fancy  but they had an english menu and were very nice  nothing mind blowing  but a very solid place for a casual dinner and beers feb 14   krispy kreme nagoya station  so like i said  i m from nc  which is krispy kreme s origin state  they had some really cool japanese flavors  so i couldn t help myself and got a few for the train  the matcha one in particular was awesome shinkansen to tokyo  grabbed a few more train snacks and an unreserved ticket and spent the ride writing out postcards to friends and fam almond hostel  amp  cafe  very nice hostel near yoyogi park  i really enjoyed the neighborhood around the hostel and wish i d had a little more time to explore  also extremely close to yoyogi station  definitely give this place a look if you re wanting a hostel in shibuya yoyogi park  after dropping my bags  i walked through the park to harajuku  i d love to see the park in a greener season  but it was still pretty and fairly busy with groups of friends practicing dances and couples having picnics and such  sat on a bench by a pond and relaxed for a bit before diving back into the city rush harajuku  and  cat street  shopping galore  i popped into a few beauty shops and boutiques  even if you re not buying  cat street is fun for some fashion browsing  cat street leans higher end  but i also ran into side streets near baird brewing with a ton of inexpensive kawaii hair clips and earrings and things  and i wish i d grabbed a few beforeing home baird brewing taphouse  really enjoyed this spot and its seasonal specials  they were super friendly and gave me excellent rendations of other places to scope out for good drinks in my few remaining days  very cozy  friendly vibe mid cafe  i tried to go check out bathhaus  but it appeared to be permanently closed  on my way back to my hostel i stumbled upon this little neighborhood italian place  it seemed to be all local families and couples having a casual friday night dinner  they were projecting gossip girl with japanese subs against one wall which was delightfully weird  i had some pasta and wine and called it a night feb 15   fuunji  one of the only queues i stood in for a meal  this place is famous for its tsukemen and the line stretched across the street and all along the back wall of the restaurant  it runs on a ticket system  which makes everything move pretty quickly  since it was just me  i actually got seated in about 20 mins   well worth it for some was fabulous tsukemen lafloret  super trendy j fashion mall in shinjuku with multiple floors of lots of different styles  i tried on a bunch of stuff here and bought a few pieces tax free  anyone into fashion would enjoy browsing around here for an hour or two ukiyo e ota memorial museum of art  a must visit for ukiyo e fans  the collection here is stunning  not a huge museum  but well worth a visit if you like the style onitsuka tiger  i m not a sneakerhead  but i d been hearing about this brand for awhile  and they had some fantastic looking japan exclusive shoes on display in the store  they were offering a 10  discount for purchases by foreign visitors and i got that tax free deal  so i snapped up my first pair of tigers for a pretty good price gallery kawano  my mom requested i bring her back a vintage kimono  so i hit up gallery kawano to find one for her  really beautiful selection  nice range of prices  and a helpful staff isetan depachika  isetan is high end with a depachika to match  strawberries were in season and i had fun browsing the hand picked  5 a pop gift strawberries and all the fancy strawberry desserts  grabbed a couple tasty snacks to go for dinner  i especially rend the depachikas if you  like me  tend to eat lots of salty  fatty  carby things on vacation and hit a wall where you suddenly crave some veggies  they have lots of beautiful salads and veg sides that you can mix  amp  match kurand sake market  this place was the best  for a flat rate you can stay for 30 min  90 mins  or unlimited time and drink freely from their absolutely fantastic sake collection  you bring up your own food  hence the depachika trip  and can use their  very informative  guides to pick what you like  or can just wing it and drink whatever looks good  i didn t have a reservation  so they could only give me a 30 min spot  but i definitely got my money s worth and enjoyed myself  staff was very kind and showed me how to make a res for my next visit feb 16   nakano broadway  i d made a friend at breakfast in the hostel cafe the day before and ran into him while walking to yoyogi station  he was headed to nakano b way and invited me along  we had fun browsing the gachapon machines and mandarakes  i left after a little while to grab lunch and get my souvenir shopping done katsumidori seibu shibuya  great spot for kaitenzushi  i think it s usually pretty busy  but i got there at a quiet moment and was seated right away  it s on the top floor of the seibu department store in shibuya  super high quality and great value  definitelying back next trip mega donki shibuya  grabbed a bunch of beauty stuff for myself and various goodies to make gift bags for my friends back home  super quick and easy tax free checkout  if you want to bring some sake back and aren t too picky  they have a few different kinds in juice box format  so you can get some individuals for friends and not worry about glass breaking in your luggage bunkamura  wanted to go through the museum here but ended up being short on time  so i just browsed the galleries and bookshop for a bit  really beautiful stuff on display and the museum exhibit looked interesting  give it a look if you re an art lover and find yourself in shibuya kurand sake market  i d told my new friend about kurand and he wanted to go  so i made us an early res  hence the time crunch  it was unbelievably nice to chat with someone over drinks andpare our travel experiences  got a 90 min slot and again  we definitely got our money s worth  we didn t bring any food this time  which we should ve  highly rend bringing a bunch of food and getting an unlimited res if you like sake and really want to enjoy this place to the fullest yamachan  we needed an immediate meal after throwing back sake for an hour and a half  i spotted a yamachan sign  can t miss the chicken bodied man  and dragged my new friend there for some wings  perfect drunk food golden gai  i wish we d dug a little deeper into golden gai  but we basically wandered into one of the first places we spotted that looked inviting  we threw back beers with a revolving cast of aussies and amercians for a few more hours before finally deciding to pack it in  fun conversations with all   looking forward to doing more golden gai next trip feb 17   gotokuji  bit of a trip out to setagaya to visit the temple  but i loved the setagaya light rail  gotokuji was beautiful  and of course all the maneki neko sculptures clustered together are so cool to see in person  the grounds are beautiful here  as is the neighborhood around the temple  i left an ema board  well worth the trip out daikanyama  stylish little neighborhood that getspared to williamsburg a lot for all of its trendy shops and eateries  i got some great street photos just wandering around here   lots of great colors  storefronts  flowers  etc king george sandwich shop  cute spot on the top of a building in daikanyama that serves absolutely beautiful stacked sandwiches  i ordered the vegetarian  and it s got to be the most gorgeous sandwich i ve ever eaten  patrons seemed to be almost exclusively young japanese women  chatting with friends far yeast brewing  i was planning on visiting  spring valley brewing  after lunch  even had my beer picked out  but they were unexpectedly closed when i arrived  note on the door and everything  i was really disappointed  but decided to visit far yeast instead  and actually had a nice time walking back through daikanyama and shibuya to get there  their beers were great  and though i remain disappointed about spring valley  i m glad i got to sample some of far yeast s offerings  their food also looked great  but i was still full from my beautiful sandwich thermae yu  a perfect onsen for tattooed  english speaking bath newbies  multiple stories of baths  saunas  rock baths  a restaurant  a bar  and relaxation lounges  more expensive than an old school onsen  but the place is huge and sparkling clean  and they re clearly used to touristsing through  i loved the mix of baths  and the specialty bath that they change up weekly moto  excellent standing sake bar on the basement level of a building  very close to thermae yu  there s an english menu available  and they did a great job explaining their  fantastic  sake selection to me  small food menu  but everything is designed to be paired with their sake  and is delicious  this is a very tight and fairly popular space  so go on the early side  i ended up striking up a great conversation with a businessman who very kindly picked up my tab at the end of my meal  thanks  businessman narita view hotel  after dragging my luggage to the closest station  i was told by a station staff member that i d missed the last bus to narita and would have to take a cab  it was an expensive ride but nice to not have to haul my luggage through public transit  i chose the narita view so that i could use their am airport shuttle  the hotel has an onsen  but by the time i got there  checked in  and settled into my room  it had closed for the night  again  it was super nice to have a space to myself  though the rooms are fairly basic  i spent the rest of my evening enjoying konbini snacks and sake while watching tv feb 18  up early to check out  hopped the airport shuttle to  narita  and headed home whew  thanks for reading  i kept a small  daily online journal for friends and family during my trip  hence my ability to remember everything  if you d like to see pictures from all of this  plus even more detail  dm me and i ll shoot you a link ,1
3 week solo trip report  jan 17   feb 18  tokyo  kyoto  nara  kanazawa  nagoya  tokyo pt  1,this is a damn novel  so i m splitting it into two posts  enjoy the quarantine reading  i needed a project preamble this trip would ve been an absolute shitshow without thisunity  i did a ton of research  but nothing provided me as much personal  up to date information as japantravels  thank you to everyone for sharing your experiences here trip nitty gritties i went with  sushi wifi  for pocket wifi  i forgot to tell them that my flight plans had changed  cancelled my flight through beijing last minute as airchina was giving refunds  and booked new flights not through china  so i was without my wifi device for my arrival evening and most of my first day  definitely not their fault  and they got it to my hostel very quickly once i did notify them  there were maybe 3 instances of my wifi lagging but i would just turn the device off and on again and it would be fine i used the  suicaeng  app and can t imagine my trip without it  super easy to use  just be aware that not every city accepts suica for all public transit  made it so easy to get around tokyo  though  and most other places i did not get the  jr rail pass  the overnight in nara wasn t something i d been planning on  and it ended up getting thrown in while i was already traveling  had i known about it ahead of time  it might ve made the jr pass worth it  but idk  i haven t done that hindsight math things i ll do differently next time pack lighter  i wore a black smartwool base the entire trip and did laundry when needed  most if not all of my stays had coin laundry available  i also didn t need most of the toiletries i brought  would ve been fine with just toothpaste  deo  sunscreen  face wash  moisturizer bring a rolling bag  for some reason i thought a rolling bag would be more cumbersome than the large backpack i brought  but the pack ended up getting super heavy with shopping acquisitions and put a serious strain on my back  i ll also take better advantage of luggage forwarding next time stay flexible  even on a relatively unstructured trip with only myself calling the shots  there were still a few situations when i wasted valuable time and energy trying to make  the perfect  meal or experience happen  my advice to myself for next time is to stay in touch with your energy levels and know when to lean into difort  i e  do walk into that intimidating izakaya with no other foreigners in sight  and when to take it easy on yourself by changing plans  i e  don t go far out of your way to find some elusive oko place when you re already worn out research neighborhoods better  my two tokyo stays were located on opposite sides of the city  east  asakusabashi  and west  yoyogi  this worked really well for planning activities around each stay  to minimize time spent zipping from one side of tokyo to another  but i think i liked the west side more  and i wish i d spent my longer stay in that area spend more money  for the most part  the budget stays i picked were fine for my solo travels  but i think i would ve had some more restful nights and thus more daytime energy if i d shelled out for actual hotel rooms or airbnbs here and there  almost everything i ate was wonderful  but since i ve been home  i ve been wishing that i sprung for one or two fancier meals  and a few more souvenirs for myself and close friends family  i know i ll take another trip to japan sometime  but especially with the state of the world atm  i m not sure when that will be  and i wish i d splurged on this one a bit more the trip jan 28 arrival at  narita  used what public wifi i could find to get my way through the metro to asakusabashi east 57 askausabashi hostel  the most budget of what were almost all budget stays for this trip  and my only stay in a mixed dorm in a hostel  which i wouldn t do again  you very much get what you pay for here  it was the least clean of all the spots i stayed  nothing crazy   just bathroom mirrors and counters weren t always the cleanest  and you had to pay a bit for every little amenity  especially this first week  i was running around like crazy every single day and basically passing out the minute i climbed into my bunk each night  so i wasn t bothered by too much  but i could ve done without the loud snoring  farting  etc of fellow travelers every morning and night it was dark and raining by the time i got to the hostel  so i dumped my stuff  ran to the closest konbini to grab an onigiri and beer dinner plus some snacks for the am  and cash  after eating and letting fam know i d made it in okay  i passed right out jan 29 edo tokyo museum  my favorite museum of the trip  i had a wonderful lunch at the restaurant on the top floor  overlooking the city  and then spent  3 hours wandering the exhibits  i thought i knew a lot about japanese history but i learned so much here  getting a more thorough framework on the different historical eras provided good context for other museums and sites i visited later in the trip  i also got a  grutto pass  here  which provides free or discounted entry to 95 museums in tokyo  i got great use out of this and at  2200 yen it quickly paid for itself ryogoku edo noren  i wanted to check out the sake tasting machines which were so cool and a nice midday treat  this would be a fun spot to grab a bite  but i was still full from lunch sumida hokusai museum  a smaller museum but really well executed exhibits on his work  kind of a dark and introspective space  which i liked  lots of english translation honen manpuku  had dinner at this edo themed izakaya in keeping with the historic context of my day  i wish i d gotten a seat with a river view but most of the place seemed to be reserved for a corporate event  and i wasn t brave enough to ask  still  had a solid sushi meal here jan 30  had a delayed morning because i sucked at using the buses  heed everyone s advice here that apple maps is the better friend when ites to buses and bus stops  despite google maps being great for everything else  due to transit confusion  i ended up eating an impromptu  brunch  of 7 11 treats  sitting in a small park overlooking the sumida river  it was actually really lovely  and i had my first of those strawberry and cream sandwiches  i can taste it now  amazing teamlab borderless  very fun  i got some amazing pictures and video  and it wasn t as packed as i d expected  my only regret was that i either missed the lantern room or it was closed that day  i did the tea room and i d rend it  the chance to sit and relax for a bit while enjoying the magical flower tea was a nice way to take a little break from the sensory overload national museum of emerging science and innovation aka miraikan  i made it here not long before close  so i wasn t able to dig into it quite as much  but i did arrive just in time to meet asimo  i had know idea he  lived  here  but i guess they do robot shows a few times a day  it was a trip to see him live  the space itself is remarkable and the geo cosmos is hypnotic odaiba onsen monogatari  my first onsen  i was super nervous about this but so excited too  i have a very small tat on my hip and i felt a little bad about lying to the lady that i didn t have any  but i was able to cover it with a towel under the guise of modesty when i was walking between baths  theon space is edo themed  and you walk around in your yukata and can eat  drink  play games  etc before and or after visiting the baths  i loved it jan 31 tsukiji market  so much fun  i tucked into a little old lady s tiny shop for an eel bowl  had giant oysters  some mind bendingly great uni wasabi thing  and a daifuku dessert  could ve spent hours walking around tasting things and wish i d allotted it more time teamlab planets  i preferred this to borderless  but i m glad i did both  i liked that the sensory experiences extended beyond the visual and auditory  and i liked there being fewer people walking around with you  it felt like a more personal experience fukagawa edo museum  very cool museum  though not a lot in the way of english translation  you wander around a life size reconstruction of a small edo era village as the lights change to mimic day shifting into night and back  much smaller than the tokyo edo museum  you only really need an hour here  give or take fukugawajuku  tiny little restaurant that specializes in a local clam and leek dish  i was a little intimidated because this place was so small and almost full with only fancy looking  middle aged japanese women  but the one amazing waitress treated me with such enthusiasm and care  i felt like i got a truly local experience here and of course the meal itself was amazing wandered around  fukugawa  and some shrines a bit and i loved this neighborhood so much  it just has a really unique  cheery character about it  i wish i d been able toe back and visit the  dragonfly craft beer bar  it s on the list for next time tobacco and salt museum  i m not sure what i was expecting  but this was a fantastic museum  i know a good bit about the history of tobacco in the us  being from nc  but didn t realize how little i knew about japan s tobacco history  my favorite exhibits were the vintage tobacco ad posters and cigarette boxes  just gorgeous design asahi sky room  amazing views of the city on the top of asahi s corporate building  all while drinking some tasty beers  we even got lucky with some distant views of fuji as the sun was going down  made a few friends here and we ended up taking some great nighttime photos with the lantern at kaminarimon  such a fun evening feb 1 marugoto nippon  and  asakusa don quijote  didn t really want to buy anything yet  but it was fun to window shop andpare twopletely different japanese shopping experiences  also my first close look at the amazing variety of japanese cosmetics and skincare  which is a big interest for me  had a chirashi bowl from one of the places at the top of marugoto nippon  and it was okay  in hindsight i wish i d gotten something from one of the many nearby street vendors or popped into one of the cheap ramen joints lining the streets of the neighborhood around kaminarimon dori national museum of nature and science  interesting exhibits  not much english  i only scoped out the permanent exhibitions and wish i d checked out the special exhibits too tokyo national museum  ditto my last sentiment  but i definitely enjoyed this more than the nat l museum of nature and science  i got yelled at for taking photos  be sure to double check for  no camera  signs if you do any museums   i was much more careful the rest of the trip  it was still amazing  despite getting fussed at  the noh masks were a highlight yanaka beer hall  this entire neighborhood is really beautiful and just the walk through it to the beer hall was an enjoyable experience  i had their yanaka flight and the mentaiko pasta  and it really hit the spot  creative use of a historic building  craft beer enthusiasts should check this place out haginoyu  i d been itching for another bath and was hoping haginonyu wouldn t be too busy but i was dead wrong  they had an english menu on hand but i somehow managed to miss renting myself a towel and i didn t want to bug them any further  this got a little awkward when i had to change back into my clothes after doing my best to squeegee myself off  but the baths were great for my tired body  would totally rend during quieter hours feb 2 kamachiku  late breakfast early lunch  gorgeous udon place in a historic building in yansen with a view of a traditional garden  had some amazing sides along with the udon and a glass of sake  spectacular meal all around yanaka cemetery park  kind of ended up here by accident when some kind of train issue screwed up my plans to go to a different park  i live in a city known for its burial sites  though  and i found it really fascinating to wander the markers and see what kind of offerings and trinkets were left for people  this is also one of these places that s impossibly quiet for being in the middle of tokyo  and that was a nice change ended up getting kind of intentionally lost in ueno station and wandered aimlessly around one of the shopping centers there for a while  artre ueno  i think titan s beer bar  great selection of local and imported craft beer here  enjoyed my beers and spicy fries  and chatted with an english ex pat  a nice way to start winding down a very casual day jazz spot intro  the most memorable bar experience of the entire trip  i got here on the early side when it was basically empty  and as the hours passed it filled up with local musicians who all took turns playing and singing  it felt so intimate and chill and i ended up having some wonderful chats with other folks at the bar  i m not even a big jazz fan but this was so much fun and felt like a truly special place feb 3 shibamata  a great place to visit for some of those shitamachi vibes  i had the local dango specialty with tea for breakfast and wandered down the busy shopping street to the large local shrine   shibamata taishakuten  the ancient pine tree here is amazing  as is the shrine and its attending structures yamamoto tei  a beautiful house built by a local businessman that blends traditional japanese design with western features  all overlooking a gorgeous garden  the weather was amazing so i enjoyed just chilling in one of the tea rooms after my tour  soaking up sunshine and gazing out over the garden national art center tokyo  a free museum and a very cool looking space  but the exhibits didn t interest me much  so i didn t stay long 21 21  design sight  stumbled upon this while wandering through roppongi and absolutely loved it  highly rended for anyone interested in design  the exhibit focusing on the creative process of notable japanese designers and engineers was very inspiring tokyo midtown depachika  the depachikas are an absolute wonderland if you re into food  i always made the mistake of going during the evening rush but i still loved wandering the aisles and ogling all the beautiful eatables  i grabbed a number of snacky things here for a late lunch hinokicho park  there s an adorable little open house along a pond in this park where you can sit and relax  i made a little picnic of my depachika snacks and enjoyed the quiet of the green space while refueling  a really sweet old couple made conversation and we exchanged pictures of our kitties mori art museum  there s an amazing view of tokyo at the top of this museum and i kind of wish i d had a meal or a drink in one of the top floor restaurants  another beautiful place to watch the sun go down over tokyo  the exhibits focused on technology as it s being applied to current and future struggles with climate  disease  etc  i really enjoyed the little robots meant to providepanionship for lonely folks  only wish i d done this earlier when i was a little less tired otako  this izakaya serves oden as its specialty  seemed like a favorite spot among locals and had an interesting mix of cliente   the kind of place that attracts folks from all walks of life  they had an english menu handy and were very kind and weing  perfect place for my first oden  and my first highball feb 4 gyoza bare a paris  fantastic gyoza and a wonderful french onion soup with more gyoza hidden in the soup  also a parsley sour which sounds weird but was so good nezu museum  beautiful collection of folding screens  calligraphy  and tea ceremony items  really  really loved the folding screens  also a sizable garden filled with shrines  sculptures  and a koi pond  the weather was still great  so i enjoyed the time outside here shinkansen to kyoto  got a reserved seat because i was worried about the size of my luggage but it ended up being totally unnecessary and i went with unreserved the rest of the trip  grabbed a great little sushi ekiben and plum wine for the ride icap manga capsule hotel  kyoto  of the places i stayed  this was among the most clean andfortable  the place is filled with manga  with a small english section  and lots offy seating  the women s bathroom was by far the best of my budget stays   only accessible with a wristband scanner  tons ofplimentary toiletries  hairdryers  curling irons  and sparkling clean  fyi you can t be anywhere in the space between 11 am and 3 pm northern lights  tiny standing bar close to my capsule hotel  was practically empty when i visited  but ended up befriending a japanese dentist  would ve been boring if not for the dentist  but we had a nice conversation feb 5 fushimi inari  starting hiking around 7 30 am  saw maybe a total of 8 9 other people on the trail  wasn t necessarily planning on hiking the whole thing  but i m glad i did  it was a peaceful and oddly kind of moving experience  stopped at several shrines on the way up and down to pay my respects grabbed lawson breakfast snacks on my way back to the hostel  including a cinnamoroll bun  which was delicious  ate  relaxed  and wrote at the hostel until they threw me out at 11 am   gion  kinniji temple  and  goou jinja  i was intending on planning my day while chilling post hike at the hostel  and being kicked out kind of ruined that  so i did some aimless wandering through gion for a while  it was gorgeous  i wish i d returned to see it in the evening  top of the list for next time  accidentally ended up by kinniji temple  so decided to tour it  very beautiful   the dragon ceiling painting is spectacular  i bet the grounds are even better in the springtime  i wish i d been able to actually enter the main part of the shrine at goou jinja  but there was a family standing at the water basin  and the parents were letting the small children play with the ladles  including letting them drop and drag on the ground  it pissed me off and i didn t want to use the ladles  so i just left after wandering the exterior a bit nijo jo castle  i wish pictures were allowed here  it is amazing  i sprung for the english audio guide and it really enriched the experience for me  if you re interested in the architecture and design of the shogunate  you ll love this bungalow  great craft beer and fantastic food  the leek tempura was one of the best dishes of the entire trip  very cool  casual space   highly rend for craft beer lovers goko yu  absolutely wonderful old school city onsen experience  i was smart this time  and went around 4 pm in the afternoon  hitting a sweet spot between the granny crowd and the post work crowd  this has a great vintage feel  wood shoe locker keys included  and is super inexpensive  they had an english menu at the counter  and couldn t have been more friendly  there were only 2 or 3 other lady patrons  and i was able to take my time enjoying all the baths   including my first electric bath  if you re in kyoto and want an authentic bath experience but are a little nervous about it  going here during slow hours would be a great way to dip your toes in  so to speak yamorido  one last craft beer stop to end the day  yamorido is housed in an old tea shop  and they use japanese tea in some of their beers in homage  got to speak to the head brewer for a bit  american guy  i think  who filled me in on the history of the building  really enjoyed their japanese saison feb 6 yamazaki   suntory distillery  i can t rend this enough to anyone remotely interested in whiskey or distilling  easy train ride from kyoto to the beautiful town of yamazaki  you get to see so much of the facility  and you can access an english guide to supplement  as the tour guide only speaks japanese  the tasting room portion was my favorite part  and you get a free pour of their signature single malt in the bar afterward  also some great stuff in the gift shop kyoto station ramen koji  on the 10th floor of kyoto station  there are a bunch of ticket ramen restaurants crammed into a corridor  couldn t tell you the name of which i picked  but i got some spicy ton ton ramen and a beer and it made for a perfect post am whisky lunch  will definitely being back here next visit to kyoto nishiki market  i did a wander through the market just to check it out  i d just had my ramen lunch so i wasn t feeling super hungry or high energy  but it was very cool to walk through  definitely worth a little more time than i gave it   would make a great meal like tsukiji if you re down with tasting as you walk village vanguard  this was basically right next to my capsule hotel  it s like a weird mix of spencer s gifts  hot topic  claire s  delia s and i don t even know what else  didn t buy anything but it was super interesting to browse and check out some japanese teen fashion along with everything else  after i was done browsing  i had a warm melonpan filled with matcha soft serve from a stand across the street for dinner feb 7 starbucks kyoto ninenzaka  the best part of this was the winding walk through the beautiful historic neighborhoods leading up to it  the starbucks itself was almostpletely empty during my visit  which was nice  i got whatever the special was and sat alone in one of the tatami mat rooms upstairs and enjoyed a quiet coffee and the view into the garden kodaji temple  and  ryozen kannon statue  i wasn t planning on visiting these  but i happened by them on my way back after coffee and decided to give them a look  both were beautiful   the statue was particularly cool  as was the  orb of power  had to make a wish iwatayama monkey park   one of the highlights of my time in and around kyoto  the hike is steep but short and the monkeys are so fascinating and fun to watch  i fed them and took a million pictures  you re given pretty strict instruction on how to interact with them  and i liked that they were able to move about the mountain and visiting area as they pleased machiya  i wasted too much time on a wild goose chase for some specific hard to find okonomiyaki place  and machiya in the  porto  shopping center was what i settled on once i gave up trying to find it  i should ve just gone straight to machiya   it has an english menu and griddles at each table so your oko doesn t go cold as you eat it  great  hearty meal for a great value hotel new wakasa in nara  i d checked out of my kyoto capsule and took the train to nara for a one night stay at this beautiful ryokan just a few blocks from the deer park  this was one of only two nights i spent not at a capsule or a hostel  and it was beyond wonderful to have so much space and a bathroom to myself  i splurged and got a room with a private outdoor bath  cannot rend this enough if you decide to splash out on a nice ryokan  i loved new wakasa s on site onsen  but being able to watch the sun go down over nara from my outdoor tub was such a memorable experience  not to mention getting in a morning soak  i opted for the kaiseki dinner and breakfast and both were fantastic  highly rend this place if you want to do nara fancy part ii  nara  kanazawa  nagoya  tokyo   ,1
india japan trip report,i posted this on  churning previouslyback from 23 day trip to india and japan   first week was in india to visit the ellora and ajanta caves near aurangabad  followed by 15

not wanting to risk illness with japan toe   cash in mumbai went for food and taxis primarily in japan the trip was predicated on reservations at 9 restaurants   8 of these accepted amex gold for the 4x points bonus   in summary i charged  1596 to credit cards and  1498 in atm withdrawals for the 3 weeks   excluding india i spent  2900 over 15 days for food and transit  or a bit less that  200 day tourism other than museum and tourist attractions  japan was pretty open as far as restaurants and street life   lots of people wearing masks   i d been before  so i mainly occupied my time by visiting shrines and parks i did pay a local for a ramen tour in tokyo as i wanted to visit the two highest rated tsukemen restaurants    tomita  and  menya ito   tomita takes effort if you want to eat there   they start selling seats at 8am for sittings between 11 and 3   there are only 8 seats  and sittings last 20 minutes   people who show up at 8 probably won t be able to get in   so my guide showed up there at 6am where 10 people were already in line  and was able to get two tickets   by 8am there was a crowd in line   that fact that the restaurant is in chiba  a long way from the center  makes it more of a challenge   itto was a bit easier   show at 5pm for a 6 30 sitting   it s still out in the sticks a bit   i d also mention that the seats at tomita are fixed and pivot  so if you re a larger guy like me you may find your stomach pressed hard into the counter places i visited in japan fukuoka   i had to have a bowl at the original ichiran ramen shop  but to be honest i wasn t impressed   that may well be because tonkotsu isn t my favorite ramen type   fukuoka castle ruins were interesting and a nice walk on a nice day   i was amused to see some women playing tennis in face masks in the park   walked all around nishi park on a second nice day   i needed a new pair of shoe laces for my walking shoes  and you re think with many sporting goods stores in canal city that wouldn t be a problem   but i still needed to hunt before finding some in the adidas shop   i got a haircut at a local shop for 1100 yen  my 15th country for doing so   shop had a machine for depositing the money and getting a ticket to give to the barber   i had the hotel concierge write a note specifying how i wanted the cut kyoto   the park hyatt was a bit over the top  but at least its locations was perfect for visiting kiyomizu dera temple as well as the gion area   i ve been to kyoto on a previous trip  so the only other two activities were the philosophers path  meh  and the heian jingu shrine on the way back   tried one of the shops for lunch at the kyoto station ramen street osaka  day trip to nara to see the todai ji shrine ended up being done in a rainstorm  but the kaiseki lunch at wa yamamura made up for it   dotonbori during the day wasn t as crowded as i remembered it from a previous trip   osaka park and castle were interesting on a hot sunny day     lots of locals out and about  but i didn t see any other tourists   one evening was for doing laundry at a local laundromat where a single machine dispensed detergent  washed  and dried in one hour for 1000 yen   the rotation during the spin cycle was truly impressive tokyo   visited tsukiji  for lunch in the rain   tried a broiled scallop with uni  a giant oyster  and a chirashi bowl   went to kappabashi street to shop for kitchen knives  and also found one of the small zesters i saw the sushi chefs using   another day i spent shopping for watches around shinjuku station and found one i d been looking for at a good price at a second hand shop the hilton hotel near disneyland is not to be rended as a layover hotel   i did so since the stay was free and it s closer to narita than central tokyo  but in reality having to change from a local train means the journey is about the same time as the narita express   i was surprised to see a fair number of the people staying there as the park was closed retrospect obviously the coronavirus changed a lot of the japan plans  as museum closing hit the day before i arrived from india   i also found that the procession of michelin starred sushiya got to be a little boring after a bit  as any other activities needed to be scheduled around the reservations   for a future trip i d reduce these to 1 or 2 and likely go for lunches rather than the dinners   that said  the kaiseki lunch i had in nara was well were a repeat visit the japan hotels have been reviewed by many redditors here  so no need for me to repeat as i agree with what i ve read here previously   switching  hotels every few days wasn t ideal  but that s what was necessary to use all the free stay opportunities iah was a ghost town when the flight arrived   i was first out  first through global entry  and my bag came out first   probably less than 50 people on our plane  and it was the only arrival at our time   as i was flying on delta  i had to transfer to terminal a   no lounges other than united   i did see a sign just past immigration where people with pending ge approvals could drop in for the interview amp x200b ,1

to stop the spread of the new coronavirus  abe  who faced criticism for being too relaxed in his initial response to the outbreak  has sought the power to prepare for a  worst case scenario gt moreover  the prime minister has extended a government request to event organizers nationwide to refrain from holding such gatherings by about 10 days  the request was initially until march 19 gt the legal change would allow the prime minister to declare a state of emergency lasting up to two years if coronavirus infections spread rapidly across the country and fears are raised of a grave impact on people s lives and the economy gt once an emergency is declared  prefectural governors can instruct residents to stay indoors and ask for schools to close and events to be canceled gt local governments can also demand that essential supplies such as medicine and food be sold to them  they can temporarily take over private land and facilities to provide medical care gt abe has already requested that schools across the nation close and big sports and cultural events be canceled or postponed  but under the current law  the government does not have the legal power to enforce school closures or event cancellations gt the main opposition constitutional democratic party of japan and the democratic party for the people say the prime minister should seek prior parliamentary approval before any declaration of a state of emergency once again   this bill does not enact a state of emergency for the country  it merely means to reflect and strengthen the laws put in place from previous

be in force until the end of this month at the very least tourism update 03 06 gt japanese prime minister shinzo abe   we will ask people entering japan from the two countries to stay at places designated by the quarantine chief for two weeks and not to use public transportation systems in the country gt a more in depth explanation of the restrictions is explained   here   gt this appears to be seperate from a bigger bill aimed at reducing the number of overall tourists at this moment to halt the spread of the virus   the nhk has posted an article on the other measures of the bill   and how it will allow the government to enact a state of emergency   giving them the power to  control some businesses  operating hours  close schools and instruct people to stay indoors  authorities would also be able to use buildings and land without their owners  consent for medical purposes    in short  if you are a korean or chinese national  you will not be allowed to enter the country without facing a 14 day quarantine  any planes arriving from either location will only be processed at either narita or kansai airport  starting march 9th  and lasting until march 31st  it will also include visitors from hong kong and macau  as well as japanese nationalsing from these countries   we are assuming this includes those returning from vacation in those areas  entry visas are being cancelled  for china  korea  hong kong  macau  and iran which sounds like it means you will be quarantined at the border  and could be sent home after the 14 days are up if you have a flight with a stopover in either country  you would be wise to contact your airline right away and arrange to either fly direct  or re route through a different area to avoid getting caught up in the quarantine  we have no confirmation that stopovers are excluded or included in this requirement  but it s better to be safe than sorry tourism update 02 28    gt the japanese government has rolled out requirements to help curb the spread of the virus  as the next two weeks are crucial for transmission within the country    tourism update 02 04 the jnto  japan national tourism organization  is advising any and all tourists arriving in japan to have travel health insurance in case they require treatment or hospitalization as a result of contracting the virus  the government of japan  will not cover the costs  associated with treatment during this time  and you  will  be required to pay out of pocket should an infection occur  and you have no insurance    more information can be found at the following link from the jnto  along with links topanies that will provide travel health insurance in japan on arrival    we strongly rend you add trip cancellation  and  travel health insurance to your budget before you depart   for precisely this kind of occurrence  please take the time to research travel insurance  and confirm with your bank or personal health care plan what is covered  or not covered  and purchase a plan that meets your needs in accordance with your trip   tourism update 01 31 the nhk has published an article reporting that jnto has a phone number to call should tourists  currently in japan  require assistance  we would not rend contacting this number if you are not currently in the country  as this line is intended to assist with possible cases and have them directed to medical

trip report  tokyo from 3 3   3 9,note this was my third time in japan  however covid 19 closures popped up in spades in the two weeks heading up to my trip  unfortunately i missed out on things i planned on attending like soccer and baseball  and a lot of main attractions were closed  however  some quick research led to quite a bit of adjustment to make the most of the circumstances  a friend who had never been to japan and had a schedule of their own also helped fill in the blanks  note i technically landed on march 2nd  and transit days are a write off for me the main key for avoiding illness was a lot of handwashing  and using hand sanitizer both from stores that put them out  and my own supply especially if i didn t trust the bathroom at a certain shop  if i needed to freshen my face  i had wipes for that to keep from touching it with my bare hands  i tried to wear a mask  but since i run warm  eventually stopped as it restricted breathing  otherwise  just take anti spread precautions like coughing sneezing into the crook of your elbow  and tissues hand sanitizer to clean up as needed march 3   yokosuka the museum memorial battleship mikasa was still open  and there was lots to see on board  especially for naval enthusiasts  plenty of memorabilia and historical artifacts  the afternoon was spent in akihabara  on the lookout for artbooks and vintage game systems march 4   asakusa nakano asakusa was oddly quiet  even if it was a rainy weekday at 10am  i usually see a lot of tourists on tv regardless of the weather conditions  it was easy to get a crowd free shot of the kaminarimon  the weather cleared up by late morning  and senso ji still had some people and tourists wandering about  but it was obvious that there were less people about  though it was still busy on the side streets  street food on the approach to senso ji was still delicious as ever nakano broadway was effectively the same story  busy  but not as packed as i remembered it  it s still a great place to go for some of the more niche and particularly vintage merchandise march 5   kawagoe this one was one of the big adjustments given the closures  a 30 minute train ride  normally  from ikebukuro station  kawagoe has the old town feel in the warehouse district  which is about a 10 minute bus ride from tobu kawagoe station  it seemed like locals got the same idea  as the area was busy  the region specializes in sweet potatoes  since i picked up related treats and a beer from coedo brewery that uses store rejected sweet potatoes to brew an amber ale  overall worth the detour from the norm the evening was spent in shibuya  little changes there  ended up eating at a cool chain yakiniku place  yakiniku like  which if you re eating alone places you in front of your own grill march 6   50 50 akihabara shibuya between arcades  and continuing to hunt for artbooks  electronics  anime merchandise  and burning money at the arcades  akihabara felt typicalpared to the last time i was here  still plenty of fun to wander around and just get lost  since i d heard that shibuya sky was still open  my travel buddy and i tried to do a walk in for tickets  unfortunately  the sun was setting and it would have been primetime for views and therefore overwhelmingly packed  instead we grabbed udon at tsurutontan on the 13th floor  we got seats at the window and the view was worth the price march 7   easy day unfortunately  not much to report here  persisting foot and leg issues caught up to me  and i kept my day short by tying up loose ends in akiba  to be honest  i regret doing this as i should have spread my time out to explore a bit more in a place like ginza or tsukiji s old outer market  however  it did set me up for the last two days to go further  at the very least i was able to once again reinforce how amazing department store food is by grabbing sushi at the termina near my hotel  this was after getting sushi and a karaage bento at odakyu the other day as well march 8   odaiba despite tokyo megaweb and joypolis being closed  diver city tokyo was still business as usual  ended up taking great unobstructed pictures of the 1 1 scale gundam  and trying hard to walk out with just one kit from the gundam base  i succeeded  as my travel buddy and i are both auto enthusiasts  we made time for autobacs and ricoland near shinonome station  while the autobacs has been unfortunately scaled down to sell the basics and inexplicably books and coffee  ricoland is the place to go if you own a motorcycle  plenty to drool over and buy if you want gear march 9   harajuku shibuya sky departure harajuku being as trendy as it is  was still quite busy  omotesando and takeshita streets were packed with people  and b side stickers has something for everyone  i tried the japanese answer to wendy s and found it okay despite having egg served on it two different ways  and the us baconator being on promotion  just wandering around to soak in the atmosphere was plenty  although for sneakerheads  seeing boxes upon boxes of yeezys means you might be fortunate to get something second hand if you re around a size 11 and below  and i was fortunate enough to get the adidas ultraboost 20 in the tokyo colorway in a size 13 as my travel buddy left the night of the 8th  i took a shot at going to shibuya sky on a prepaid ticket the afternoon of the 9th  lesson learned  the shibuya sky view is not as high as tokyo skytree or as open as tokyo city view  but it offers a fantastic vantage point from a more bustling part of tokyo for anyone wondering about the flights  however  yvr hnd via ana looked about two thirds full  i did share a row with one person on the way there  but had my own on the way back  it seemed like there were some last moment cancellations as seats marked for special meals turned out empty ,1

hokuriku shinkansen trip report  10 days in tokyo  fuji nagano  toyama  kanazawa  kyoto  osaka and hiroshima side trip ,a long time back  i posted for rendations for places to go as a second time traveller to japan  i linked my previous post here just for reference so i ve just returned from said trip to japan  and thanks to the rendations of redditors we had a rough idea of which lesser known cities we could go and explore  instead of the tokaido shinkansen  we went during mid to late february 17 27  which is considered an off peak period right before march april  cherry blossom season  golden week etc my travelling group was quite big  consisting of 7 close friends who knew each other from back in school  we were quite broke and had orginally planned on budgeting  which all went out the window once we arrived in osaka  japan s shopping mecca  transportwe bought the 7 day  national japan rail pass  instead of the  hokuriku arch rail pass  there was a flash discount on  klook  for the national rail pass  and since we had planned an itinerary which left us with a couple of days of free time  we were keen on exploring other parts of the country not included within the arch rail pass such as hiroshima we also bought the  wee suica  card  which was a tourist rechargeable card valid for 28 days  all around the places we visited  it helped us get around easily within the city we were in  aodationwe mostly rented airbnb as they were the cheaper option and we had planned to save on aodation as we wanted to splurge on shopping there  the only hotel we stayed in was the  hotel metropolitan nagano  a small hotel right next to the nagano train station  it was convenient as nagano was our  base  for numerous trips around this area  itineraryday 1 arrived in haneda international airport at 3 am  and waited for the first train on the tokyo monorail out to tokyo city had breakfast at a nice bakery right beside  ueno park  exploring  ameyoko street  in the afternoon  and walked all the way down to  okachimachi and akihabara  where my friends being the weebs they were geeked out like crazy over the endless rows of the department offering everything anime we had dinner at  hinoya  near akihabara and headed back to our airbnb at ueno for some rest day 2 breakfast at  tsukiji fish market  we had some good sushi at  sushi zanmai  and walked around the market to eat the little food gems they had to offer  look out for the strawberry daifuku and warabi mochi  they were so good explored  asakusa     nakamise shopping street   senso ji and kaminarimon ikebukuro  and  shibuya  for evening and night   pokemon center  seibu department store   mutekiya  for a late lunch and  shibuya crossing  visited an izakaya drinking establishment  for dinner till late day 3 after activating our 7 day jr rail pass  we took an early train from shinjuku station to  kawaguchiko station  on the  mt  fuji excursion express boat ride around kawaguchi lake and up the  fuji ropeway  to a neighbouring mountain for breathtaking views of mt  fuji    however  the view was obscured at times by passing clouds  so it could be a hit or miss depending on your luck that day at sunset  we caught a local train to  arakurayama sengen park  where we caught the best unobstructed view of mount fuji in all its splendour  illuminated by the setting sun  amazing back to shinjuku station at night for dinner at  tsunahachi shinjuku  and packed our bags in preparation for inter city travel the next day day 4 we caught the morning train along the hokuriku shinkansen to nagano station stored our luggage at our hotel and took a bus from the station to  jigokudani monkey park  numerous monkeys appear right beside you along the 25 minute hiking trail  bring sturdy shoes  to the hot spring  foraging for food and jumping around trees  captured amazing pictures of monkeys cuddling their offspring in the brutal cold and adolescent monkeys playing in the hot spring and grooming each other  an absolute highlight of the trip and a must visit in winter we packed a day s worth of clothes with us  as we were going to spend the night at  shibu onsen  a quaint hot spring town offeringunal baths  after a bit of getting used to  soaking in the hot springs was the most relaxing feeling ever  booked a ryokan and had a  kaiseki dinner let the ryokan know in advance if you have dietary restrictions  and experienced sleeping on futons with tatami mats day 5 checked out of the ryokan and took the snow monkey limited express train back to nagano station  checked in to the hotel and took the shinkansen to  kanazawa  explored  kenroku en garden  lunch at  omicho market  and watched a  geisha performance  at the  higashi chaya district  dinner back at nagano station day 6 took the shinkansen to toyama station we spent the day walking around the department stores near the station  then took the limited express train in the afternoon into the mountains surrounding  shirakawago  where we saw the thatched roofs of farmhouses supporting thick layers of snow  right out of a fairytale story  there was a winter light up of the houses at night which would have been magical  but we had missed the dates by about a week   check the dates before you visit to catch the light up  it will be spectacular day 7 early morning shinkansen ride from nagano to kanazawa  transferred trains at kanazawa to the  jr thunderbird express  train  bringing us from kanazawa to osaka after reaching our airbnb in osaka  we had lunch at marugame udon  a popular udon chain across the country   we then took the kintetsu train limited express to nara  to see deer roam freely around  nara park  explored the higashimuki shopping district outside nara station in the evening  and headed for a  sushi conveyor belt dinner  at  dotonbori  the shopping mecca of osaka  and possibly japan  did a simple recce of the area before heading back to our airbnb for the night we would end up visiting this district in osaka every subsequent night from this point  whenever our planned itineraries ended earlier than expected  it had everything you could think of when you call the word  shopping  to mind  from designer clothes to pharmacy products  mega don quijote stores right beside pounding nightclubs  it was the best entertainment district i ve been to in japan day 8 trip to kyoto on the shinkansen  about 15 minutes of travel time visited  kinkaku ji  arashiyama bamboo forest  fushimi inari taisha and kiyomizudera  in hindsight and if you have the time  i rend splitting up the attractions into 2 a day  with some shopping and travel time buffer in between each  4 in a day was really a stretch and we felt like our legs had died at the end of the day  if you really are tied for time in kyoto  must visits are arashiyama forest and fushimi inari taisha  in my opinion we had  okonomiyaki and takoyaki  in osaka for dinner   you definitely have to try these two foods out  they were amazing day 9 day trip to hiroshima  where we visited the  atomic bomb dome ground zero  ate hiroshima style tsukemen  really spicy  and did a bit of shopping at  hatchobori  the main shopping avenue in hiroshima  a nice quaint city where everyone seemed to smile more and were more relaxed than in the major cities day 10 the  final day of shopping  in osaka  my friends and i went to town on all the department stores  buying all sorts of souvenir products to remind ourselves of japan  our last meal before leaving was  ichiran ramen    a must if youe to japan  in my opinion ps  regarding the coronavirus situation  we came back right before the government declared a state of emergency  leading to various attraction being closed  a good 70 80  of people in crowded places had a face mask on  if you must cough sneeze  do it quietly and point it away from others  other than that  there were minimal disruptions at that point in time  to our trip it was one of the most memorable trips i ve ever been on  and thanks for making it this far if you read all the way  if you have any questions about itinerary logistics etc  feel free to ask me and i ll get back to you as soon as possible ,1

looking for april trip alternatives suggestions,our trip is approaching  march 29   april 11  but since we might not be able to see some of the stuff we wanted to  because of the current closures  we re trying to assemble plan b  just in case these closures extend through april  we wanted to go to himeji castle  but if it stays closed  are there any other magnificent castles worth visiting  we ruled out osaka castle  and hiroshima castle is too far away  and also closed afaik then there s disneysea  it s kinda unique to us so we wouldn t do another amusement park  but we have that day and the one after it free so maybe a day two day trip from tokyo   we already have nikko  hakone and fuji five lakes  the second day was supposed to be ueno  museums and zoo  and edo tokyo museum day so we re maaaybe looking to experience something similar  a bit of japanese history  especially edo period ,1
trip report  8 days in tokyo  suwa  kamakura,thanks for all the assistance  japantravel  the rendations and resources on here were invaluable while i planned my trip  there were a lot of places we initially wanted to visit but were shut down due to the virus concerns  this itinerary was a lot looser due to this  but left more openness for us to try out different things   day 1  landed at haneda international at the crack of dawn  took limo bus to shinjuku station exit  couldn t find a cab  and ended up walking 20 minutes to our hotel  citadines shinjuku  not central  slept because jetlag really did love this hotel  was like a little apartment and had a ton of amenities  staff was also incredibly aodating and we found a lot of awesome restaurants nearby   day 2  harajuku and shibuya  visited meiji jingu  which was gorgeous  walked takeshita street  introduced to my new love at the calbee store  and visited hachiko statue  perused and nearly bankrupted myself at ca nintendo jump  stores  returned to shinjuku to get some amazing burgers at burger chatty chatty day 3  ueno took the train to ueno and began with mister donut breakfast  walked to senso ji and visited the shrine  walked over to ueno park and took in the pond  as well as the nearby samurai fest  the museums were closed so we couldn t visit the one i wanted to  but opted to return to shinjuku kacbuki cho for arcades and bottle shopping  ended with an izakaya dinner that was tasty day 4  lake suwa originally scheduled to visited hakushu distillery but it was closed due to virus concerns  started off the day at edinburgh cafe  amazing coffee  and took the jr train from shinjuku to kami suwa station  walked the lakeside and visited takeshima castle  we stayed at sui suwako onsen hotel for the night and got to watch the sunset on the lake  amazing experience  highlight of the trip day 5  akihibara took the jr back to shinjuku  dropped our stuff off and went over to akihibara  shopped at kotobukiya  animate  and tons of other shops  had lunch at the eorzea cafe  visited more figure and anime shops for souvenirs  returned to shinjuku to have a nightcap at bar lian  where a bilingual patron assisted the bar owner and us with whiskey orders  day 6  odaiba minato akihibara traveled down to odaiba and visited diver city early  unfortunately joypolis  teamlabs and the ferris wheel were all closed due to the virus  so we ended up checking out the unicorn gundam  shopping and seeing olympic rings  decided to instead check out tokyo tower  which ended up pretty cool  there s actually way more to do in the area than i first thought  i wish we spent more time in this area but i really didn t know what was around at the time  notes for next time went back to akihibara for more shopping  checked out craft beer tap at yadobashi and sampled some amazing uchu brewing ipa  also visited hitachino nest with their drool worthy espresso stout  back to shinjuku for snacks and bed   day 7  kamakura rainy day so we borrowed umbrellas and took the train down to kamakura station  after some fried chicken and pancake breakfast at garden house  walked to the buddha statue  took a jaunt down to hasadera temple to take in the gorgeous seaside views  well worth climbing the stairs to see  after nabbing some bottles of kamakura moon  seriously  this brew is great and i m a fool for only buying 1 bottle  and cookies  took a third run at akihibara  visited cure maid cafe and ebis pachinko parlor  went beer shopping and ended the night with some jaw dropping spicy ramen at shaka in shinjuku   day 8  shinjuku return home packed up our stuff and checked out of the hotel  returned to edinburgh for a chill morning breakfast set  then walked shinjuku gyoen national garden  the greenhouse was lovely  but it was super windy outside and made the general walk a little miserable  shopped some more in shinjuku main  bought some kitkats  tried hoshino coffee  just ok  and took the limo bus to haneda for our flight home   amp x200b overall this was a really fun trip for me  even though things were closed that i wanted to do  i still had a lot of fun  my regret was not revisiting my plans when a ton of things got shut down and kinda truncating our days  because of that  i didn t realize that things would be closed on conflicting days like ebis or the maid cafe  so we got stuck orbiting akihibara to hit up these places  also thanks to the folks rending kamakura beer  my goodness  this is such a tasty brew  ,1

sim card review,i recently got back from japan  flying in and out of narita airport  i found it a bit overwhelming looking over all the options for sim cards and travel wifi beforehand but i ended up buying an  iijmio travel sim  to cover my 10 day trip  there were probably a few places at the airport but we found ours on the bottom floor of terminal 1 where the jr and keisei trains leave  the family mart there had some and the keisei skyliner information center also had their own version  co branded but identical in price data  this was very convenient for us since we were at the jr office to pick up our jr pass and also went to the skyliner office to pick up the skyliner   tokyo subwaybo pass  cash only at the skyliner office but not sure about that family mart i got the 1 5gb version for ¥2050  the 3gb version was ¥3000 or so  both are good for 30 days  for me  that was plenty  it was an easy setup using the provided instructions with my older android phone  my particular phone wasn t on their list of phones approved to work but there were no issues getting up and running  coverage was excellent as far as i could tell while we were in tokyo  kyoto  himeji  nara and hakone ,1

one night stop between osaka and tokyo ,hello  my boyfriend and i have a two and a half week trip in the beginning of april planned  we have jr passes and we are also starting our trip in tokyo for 5 days  we are leaving osaka on the 14th and we fly out of tokyo on the 17th  we planned to stay in tokyo a couple of days before we fly out but we were wondering if there would be a cool city to stay in that s on the route from osaka to tokyo for one night to break up our train ride and maybe see one last place before we leave  we were thinking of nagoya possibly but didn t know if it would be worth staying a whole day  any advice would be appreciated ,1
 slight  misuse of jr pass,i m planning my second trip with friends to japan for late 2020 early 2021  or whenever post corona is  and am likely going to be on more of a budget than last time  to save money i m considering purchasing a regional kyushu rail pass for the first leg as we ll likely being into fukuoka from busan  given that the northern pass is cheaper  and we only want to side trip to dazaifu  kitakyushu and nagasaki i think it s the best option  however  when i looked up whether it s applicable to usuki  the port town with the ferry to shikoku   the website advises that usuki is just south of the northern rail pass border  in oita  as i doubt we ll be keen to get off the train to buy a  30 ticket to the next down over  or pay an extra  100 to extend our pass that extra distance i was wondering what you guys thought about going what appears to be a couple of extra stops and pretending we hadn t read the fine print  usuki is still very much in the north of kyushu i would say  even if it s not classified as such   at least enough that our confusion might be reasonable  we didn t mess around the first time with our jr pass  don t mind being a little bit adventurous the second time around as long as it doesn t end in a large fine  tldr  do you think you would get in trouble fined by going one town south of the border of the kyushu northern rail pass to access the ferry from usuki to shikiku ,1
travelling to japan with disability,i ve been spending some time reading the faq and traveljapan guides and all of that  and i m looking for a little advice i d really  really love to go to japan  but i have a bit of a hang up  i have a fatigue fainting issue  and need to rest  frequently  i d love to stay in tokyo and take the train to places like kyoto  and maybe stay at an onsen at least once  but how realistic is travelling to japan when you can t really go for longer than 30 minute walks before you need a good rest  would it be do able and worth it  in your experience ,1
out of myfort zone in nagoya   need encouragement ,hey everyone  this is more of an   i m nervous and i don t know what i m doing  post more than anything  i m  30f  in nagoya under unique circumstances with my husband  37m  who is here for work and will be for the next two months  i have a good gig with my job where i can work remotely and they were totally cool with me joining my husband while he s here we were given only a couple days notice from my husband s work that they were sending him to nagoya  so we only had a few days to pack and get our home together for a two month stay  not enough time to do any research or build itineraries  on top of that  most attractions are closed and even the fitness room in our hotel is closed because of the virus  also  nagoya isn t really a tourist destination we have a hotel in nagoya booked for the next two months and i have no idea what i m doing  i can t speak any japanese  i can t read it   i m still very confused by google translate with japanese  i spend most of the day alone while my husband is at work  an izakaya restaurant was rended to me and when i got there  nothing was in english and no pictures anywhere  i was too afraid to go inside and ended up eating at the train station again  my husband and i travel a lot together but this time i am so far outside of myfort zone that i don t even recognize myself  i think this is good for me  but at the moment i m too intimidated to go into a restaurant  ugh anyway   anyone have any words of encouragement  i ve spent hours wandering around nagoya  but even the nagoya castle is closed because of the coronavirus  does anyone have any day trip rendations or links to itineraries for day trips around nagoya  self guided walking tours  thanks so much for your help amp x200b update i am so thankful for all of your responses  i am making my way through them and will continue tomorrow  i immediately took the advice from some of the first responses and went to kyoto  in fact  instead of stopping by the starbucks on my way out  i went to a bakery in the train station and ordered a   burakkukohi   black coffee  and showed the guy at the counter my google translate version to make sure i was saying it right  this alone gave me some confidence  then i went to the ticket machines to buy a ticket to kyoto  a woman came up to me and asked   are you ok  because i was standing there longer than i probably should have  trying to figure out which train i needed  i nearly cried from gratitude  i got to kyoto and it s magical  here are some pictures from my day today  i hope this link works i went to kiyomizu dera  then ate some karaage and ramen  wandered around and got lost  i took a train to fushimi inari taisha  then a train back to the nishiki market  another very friendly japanese man asked me where i was trying to go because i was looking at the map for awhile  trying to make sure i was going the right direction  went to the nishiki market  had a few beers  then back to the kyoto train station and now i m back safe in nagoya  i m still working up the nerve to go back to that izakaya restaurant   but i will this week and i ll keep you posted  i am exhausted i can t wait to read through the rest of the replies  i took a couple screen shots of some of the phrases you all sent and have been using them today thank you so much amp x200b update 2  just wanted to tell you all that i m making my way through your rendations  this weekend  i went to osu market and surrounding area  i will definitely spend more time there  i spent the day walking through the market and taking the subway  it was very very rainy and dreary out  we also went to yamachan for dinner and it was great  i did laundry last night and i went to an izakaya restaurant next to the laundromat and i made friends with the woman behind the bar  she told me she was in japan for school and to study english  she is from south korea  she taught me some phrases  specifically how to order another drink  okawari  then it was warm and sunny today so i took a train down to tokoname to walk through the pottery path some more photos     amp x200b amp x200b ,1

touring japan by bike,i am a 32f and am thinking of changing my cycle tour plans from europe to japan in may june  8 10 weeks  i had been planning a big bike tour to europe that was all about crossing borders i coulde to japan instead and visit the least populated prefectures as the inaka  rural places  were always my favourite when i lived here  like everybody who is travelling i am concerned about corona virus but i also have hollowed a piece of time in my life and i don t think i can make it happen again anytime soon  i also would prefer to be somewhere i can speak the language and understand the medical system  if you have lived or visited anywhere in japan that was out of the way of the big touristy destinations and you enjoyed it  please rend me some places  i am trying to plan a trip in a short amount of time and i need a way to gather knowledge about places that a lot of tourists don t go  i am especially interested in kyushu  tottori  shimane  shikoku and tohoku   i lived in hokkaido so i m up with the play about all the strange and random things there  i was wondering if anyone had done any bike tours in kyushu shikoku the japan sea coast in may and june and if they had any advice for me  i plan on sleeping outdoors as much as possible to keep costs down ,1

introverts  how do you pass the time while travelling alone in japan ,hey all  i ll be in japan for about two weeks in may and i m wondering how other introverted solo travellers spent their  dead time  in between activities  a bit about me  i ve always been a bit of a lone wolf when ites to doing things so no surprise that i opted to visit japan for the first time as a solo traveller  i m quitefortable being on my own but when i do socialise it s usually with only one or two other people at a time otherwise i ll stay quiet in a larger group  i m okay to venture out on my own but i don t drink or like crowded  noisy places  if it matters  i m female  i know other reddit posts have mentioned solo travelling  but most of the advice is about meeting up with fellow travelers to have a good time  however  i m not looking to meet up with people to have chats over a beer orit to spending an afternoon together  i am however  open to spontaneous convos with others  for example  i wouldn t mind chatting with a local during a meal if language wasn t a barrier or helping a lost tourist my japan travel interests  i m keen to visit universal studios  disneysea  ride the shinkansen and go to night markets street food areas  i want to know what all you other introverted solo travellers did whileuting on the trains  waiting in line for food or rides and how you spent your time wandering the food streets like nakamise  nishiki market and dotonbori in between eating  anyone have suggestions for me or willing to share how they made the most of this dead time edit  nothing to do with the original post but someone s  keeps downvoting mine and other people sents seemingly without reason  is it normal to have such trigger happy people on reddit  i usually spend my time browsing through posts withoutenting so i m not sure if there s some sort of online etiquette i failed to follow ,1
rbc credit card won t work  amp  having trouble calling canada,hoping someone has a suggestion or advice  last year we used visa cards to buy shinkansen tickets without issue  today tried to buy them and clerk said hubby s card wouldn t work so i gave my card  same thing   have been all over rbc website and internet and have tried different variations of numbers and country code and with or without   sign  nothing seems to work  if i had actually lost my cc i d be freaking out right now  but instead i m just utterly frustrated  is there some issue with dialing to canada from cell phone or   any help appreciated ,1
can i sell my extra disneysea tickets outside of the venue ,me and my friend tried to book disneysea tickets on the changirends website but the page suddenly closed as we were confirming payment  my friend s card was not charged as of then so we assumed the transaction did not go through and bought the tickets at a travel agency the next day  after buying the tickets at the travel agency  she received an email from changirends saying that we have booked tickets  we then requested a refund from changirends and explained to them our situation but was declined  so now we have an extra 2 tickets  we were wondering if anyone knows whether we are allowed to sell our extra tickets on the day itself outside the venue and whether there are people who are looking to buy last minute tickets there edit  thank you everyone for all the suggestions  yesterday we read on the news that disneysea is continuing to close until april  so we are more than happy to get refunded for all 4 of our tickets hahawe also decided to cancel our trip in light of the situation  it s just way too risky to travel now,1
to onsen or not to onsen ,hi travel fam  we re in the middle of planning our first trip to japaning up the end of may beginning of june  we have one kid and are planning to try for our 2nd right after this trip  so a subsequent trip to japan is not in the near future for us  as such trying to see and experience as much as we can in our 2 weeks  to my question  since we re going when it will be hot  is an onsen experience something we can skip this time  i ve heard such amazing things about it  i just think hot springs is not going to be as relaxing refreshing when it s 80 27 degrees out  thoughts amp x200b edit  i definitely wasn t expecting such overwhelming responses in favor of onsen  so i wiggled things around and incorporated into our itinerary  thank you so much everyone  ,1

 itinerary check  march 26 april 13  planning 2nd half of trip after tokyo and japanese alps,hi all  my friend and i  23m  are planning our first trip to japan and have been going in circlesparing 3 potential options for the latter 10 days of our trip  this is more so a question of pacing than specific things to do at each spot  as we re confident we won t run out of things to do regardless of which option we choose  neither of us will have the luxury of taking another extended trip like this for some time as we both start full time jobs when we return to the us  so we want to make sure we hit all the quintessential highlights in the tokyo kyoto regions  while also leaving time to explore a couple other spots that aren t along the main tourist path between those areas  also  for planning purposes i m assuming most everything we want to see will be open from coronavirus closures  if that s not the case we ll cross those bridges when we get there first week of trip  more or less set  but still open to suggestions 26 arrive tokyo late afternoon27 tokyo 28 tokyo29 tokyo30 tokyo31 tokyo  to shinhotaka onsen1 shinhotaka onsen  to takayama2 takayama option 1 for apr 3 13 3 takayama  to hiroshima4 hiroshima  ferry to miyajima 5 hiroshima  to kyoto 6 kyoto7 kyoto  nara daytrip  hanshin tigers game at night 8 kyoto  to kix isg9 ishigaki 10 ishigaki11 ishigaki 12 ishigaki  to isg nrt13 tokyo  to home  option 2 for apr 3 13 3 takayama  to kyoto4 kyoto5 kyoto6 kyoto  to nara  to osaka7 osaka  hanshin tigers game 8 osaka  to kix isg9 ishigaki10 ishigaki11 ishigaki 12 ishigaki  to isg nrt13 tokyo  to home  option 3 for apr 3 13 3 takayama  to kanazawa4 kanazawa 5 kanazawa  to kyoto6 kyoto7 kyoto8 kyoto  to nara  to osaka9 osaka  hanshin tigers game 10 osaka  to hiroshima11 hiroshima  ferry to miyajima 12 hiroshima   to tokyo13 tokyo  to home  thoughts  we really like the idea of ending our trip relaxing on a beach in warm weather  as we re thinking we ll be fairly exhausted from two weeks of aggressive sight seeing  as such  option 3 is more so a backup if flight prices to ishigaki shoot up in the next couple weeks  since we ll likely wait until shortly before we leave to buy tickets in case we have to scrap the whole trip due to the   virus  open to have my mind changed on that though if people think kanazawa is all that and a bag of chips  plan would be to the get 7 day jr pass for option 1 and 14 day jr pass for option 3  activating both on march 31st paring options 1 and 2  the hiroshima peace museum and all things atomic bomb related fascinate me  and i ve also read great things about miyajima  despite the shrine being under renovation  so that s a big plus for option 1  but i m concerned that doesn t leave enough time for the kyoto osaka region  which seems to frequently be the highlight of peoples  japan trips  neither my friend nor i are what i would consider to be  shrine buffs  so would 1 5 days be enough to at least see the main highlights of kyoto  if not  would you advise taking off a day from tokyo and giving it to kyoto  option 1 also has us almost entirely skip osaka  save for going to a hanshin tigers game  which is a priority since we re baseball fans and have read that koshein stadium is the best place to catch a game  i m less concerned about missing osaka as it seems to get fairly meh reviews  but again i m open to have my opinion changed if you feel strongly the other  way thanks in advance for any responses ,1

hakodate airport shuttle bus,has anyone ever taken this shuttle bus  we are looking at flying from hakodate to tokyo  but not sure if the airport shuttle bus has the undercarriage that fits suitcases or is it one where you take the suitcase onto the bus directly  considering the option of sending it down to tokyo via yamato delivery service  as we may be travelling as a group of 2 to 6  depending if other members are joining us ,1
a story from my visit to japan, from taipei  i had taken a flight to osaka  my airbnb host had shared his location  but by the time i reached his neighbourhood  phone s battery had already died  power bank was dead  too i knew i was close to my destination  but i didn t know which building to enter  it was hot and the weight on my shoulders weren t helping just then  a man approached me  he was carrying packets of food from mcdonald s  he asked if i needed any help  when iplained that i couldn t contact my host because my devices ran out of power  he apologized for not carrying a power bank he went on to invite me to his place   a short walk from there   so i could charge my phone  i insisted that i shouldn t as my host would ve tried to reach me and might ve evene out to the street looking for me  so he made a call and said something in japanese i assumed he had made a call to inform at home that he d be late  guilty  i requested him to carry on but he wasn t willing to listen he suggested that we sit on the pavement and have the food he was carrying  i could have directly said no  but i thought of using a nice excuse   i m vegetarian smiling  he pulled a packet of potato fries and brought it close to me  i ate   as slowly as i could barely five minutes after he had made that call  someone came riding a bicycle  it was his wife  she brought me a power bank the four of us   the couple  i  and google translate   conversed for a few minutes before my host arrived before wishing goodbye  i gave them a bracelet each which made them really happy but they were elated when i said   arigato dosaimasu  sic they didn t correct me  just expressed their happyness  p s  you can find more such stories on my instagram   mehulmanot13,1

17 feb   2nd march solo trip report  tohoku  nozawa onsen  tokyo , background i ve never been to japan before and never even been solo travelling before  usually i d head somewhere with friends or family so this was a new experience for me  i d wanted to go solo as i wanted to take my time and not have to perhaps see or do something that i wouldn t have wanted to  therefore  this gave meplete freedom over my trip i wanted to head over to japan mostly due to wanting to go on a holiday by myself and just relax  i picked a few places with great scenery and a lot of nature for that reason  including spending a night at a ryokan  japan was high on my list due to the culture  it s different from what i m used to and was definitely a big factor in me wanting to go i d actually decided to go in february  partly due to the fact that the flight prices were pretty good  more on that later  and the fact that i had a week off of university  but i opted to go for two weeks and catch up a week since i thought one wasn t really enough   feel free to take a look at some pictures i took costs flights   502 gbp  68927 43 yen aodation   538 gbp  73870 43 yen cash from atm  used on things on list    418 gbp  57393 75 yen food  amp  drink   approx  500 gbp  68652 81 yen entertainment   approx  250 gbp  34326 41 yen gifts   approx  150 gbp  20595 84 yen transportation   approx  250 gbp  34326 41 yen others   approx  250 gbp  34326 41 yen total spent   approx  2850 gbp  391725 38 yen tips   what i ve learnt  if you are travelling alot like i was  get the jr pass  all in all  i must have saved at least 20 000 yen  also  buy a pasmo card  they can be used for local trains  for coin lockers and even at convenience stores  just so easy to use  i bought a 16 day unlimited sim card from the japan rail pass website  it was only 25 pounds for all that  used about 15gb the whole trip  immensely useful  way cheaper and less to carry than a portable wifi  the language barrier can be tough  but learning someon phrases can go a long way  for myself  i was able to order in japanese in most restaurants i ate in by looking at what i wanted beforehand  otherwise  if the menu is in japanese and they don t have an english one  use the google translate app on your phone  the camera translate feature is honestly great and i used in on a multiple of occasions to great effect  might sound a bit cliche  but don t be afraid to just go for something  going solo in particular can be stressful but don t be afraid to go to a japanese restaurant and just order  same goes with izakayas  sure most people are there in groups  but don t be discouraged from going in there alone and just having a good meal  you ll be walking alot  i walked close to 200km the whole trip  and in the winter months  i d rend a good set of boots  i used my merrell moab adventure and they felt great  though if you want to save money  wearing any decent trainer is fine  i walked around tokyo with my vans and they honestly felt fine  so don t be too tempted to buy something new  don t take too much  i carried around one small suitcase and a messenger bag to carry onto the plane with a charger and the like  but i never needed to take it with me around  i always walked  unless i m transferring from city to city  without any bag burdens  if you need more space for souvenirs  just do what i did  carry a fold able duffel bag in your suitcase and bring it out when needed  plus most places have shampoo conditioner  towels for free so you can save some space on that  i was never turned away from any restaurants bars but it can happen  so don t feel discouraged or annoyed that it happens  there are plenty more around  bins   trash cans are scarce  but the roads are always so clean  asked many locals about this  they essential said it s good as it allows people to just carry their own trash with them  japan is safe  but be on your guard just like in any other country  don t follow the africans in shinjuku   roppongi  they aren t your friends and just want your money  also  the drivers are safe but i saw a couple of cars getting pulled over by police for wrong turns  exercise caution on roads  japan is pretty cash heavy  but not as much as i was led to believe  even in small towns in tohoku such as yamadera and hiraizumi  many places took card  so always carry cash  but the majority of my payments were via my card  i d say 70  of all allergies  if you ve got allergies like i do  remember to never take a chance  i ve got a few food allergies that can lead to anaphylaxis and thus  and you already know this i m sure  always carry your epi pen and get a travel insurance that covers food allergies  most don t usually as they can be classed as a pre existing condition  so ensure you ve got one that covers it  eating around with allergies was not actually as bad as i was expecting to be honest  i couldn t really just walk into a restaurant that looked interesting since i pre planned most of what i wanted to eat  not in the sense that i was extremely limited  quite the opposite  i just made sure that what i was eating was going to be alright via checking the menu of the restaurant beforehand  this was done easiest through their website  though if they didn t have one  looking at their menu via google images is good enough  otherwise  looking at reviews helped  i m not going to say avoid street food  but i didn t really eat any since it s harder to figure out what s inside  plus in certain instances  something could be cooked in  for example  a peanut oil but since that s not directly in the food itself  they might not say  so again  please be as careful as possible  here are a couple of good websites to check out prior to going                         day by day   this is quite long  will add a tl dr at the bottom of each day in bold   monday  17 feb      my flights consisted of london to zurich  zurich to tokyo  then a domestic flight from tokyo to sendai  arrived in sendai about 10 am so i had plenty of time to do what i wanted  opted to go to  matsushima  on the first day since i wanted to visit the  tohoku university botanical garden  which was closed on a monday  dropped my stuff off at the hostel i was staying at  orit hostel  and went to matsushima       matsushima  was great  visited  zuiganji temple   amp   enstsuin temple  since they were near each other  one of the first time really looking at temples in this style  spent a while here  would rend  the weather was a tad cold but it wasn t raining or anything so i opted to visit the small islands consisting of  godaido temple   oshima island   amp   fukuurajima island  great thing about matsushima is that everything is so close to each other  so you could walk around looking at the scenery beforeing across any one of the attractions  they are all conveniently near  i also visited the  kanrantei tea house  originally built in kyoto before being moved to matsushima by date masamune s son  it s a beautiful old building overlooking the islands  you can have some tea and a sweet while overlooking the bay which is what i opted to do since i was a tad hungry  plus i d never really had matcha tea  to be honest  if i could describe it  it s tastes like what grass smells like  bit of an odd description but it s not something i would get myself but happily drink  since i don t dislike it but don t like it that much either  if i had more time  i would have visited the  saigyo modoshi no matsu park   amp  potentially the  date masamune museum      wanted to eat at this italian seafood place called  matsushima toto italian  but at the end of the day when i went there  it was closed  so i went back to sendai and ate at  rikyu ichibancho yanagimachi  a beef tongue or gyutan place  i ve never had it before but was pleasantly surprised  bit chewy but was delicious  the oxtail soup supplied alongside added a nice refreshing difference in taste as well       tl dr   went to matsushima  weather was nice  temples and islands were beautiful  matsushima bay was a sight to see  ate gyutan at the end of the day   tuesday  18 feb      breakfast consisted of  as most days  coffee and a pastry sweet  pancakes  french toast  great way to start the day in my opinion  first thing i did was walk to the  zuihoden mausoleum  looked around there for a while  the walk there was refreshing to be honest and the area itself is fairly large to explore  afterwards  i walked towards the  aoba castle ruins  amp  park  at this point it started to snow a bit  but overall the weather was alright  when i arrived at the top  it even started to clear out  would i rend going here  i think so  it was a great way to kill an hour or two with the walk up and looking at the view over sendai and the statue of date masamune looks pretty good  i then walked to the  tohoku university botanical garden  though unfortunately it was closed  bit disappointing but just decided to walk around the area instead  i also sat watching some people practice playing baseball for about 10 15 minutes  was a nice thing to just watch      after this  walked back into sendai and had lunch  ate a hamburg steak at this chain named  ikinari steak  and it was pretty delicious  barely finished the thing since it was a very generous amount  after that  went to the  kamei arena sendai  since i do admit i like watching haikyuu  i m not a big anime fan really  but it s one of the only ones i ve ever watched and since the arena was close  decided to visit  looked just like it and since it was empty  except for the tohoku university handball team doing some practice  i was able to look around freely  went back to the hostel and slept shortly afterwards  this was about 7 or so  the time difference was not easy for me to change to honestly  if i was awake  i would have also visited the  sendai mediatheque  in the evening but was too tired to do anything       tl dr   went around sendai  visited date s mausoleum  the castle ruins and the kamei arena sendai  had a hamburg steak for the first time  went to sleep early because of the time zone difference   wednesday  19 feb      woke up early  must have been around 5 or something  took my bags to the train station and took the first train to  yamadera  had some onigiris for breakfast  actually delicious  plus you get so many choices of fillings  plum is a definite favourite for me  i don t get to see snow often  london does not get any pretty much  and this place had quite a lot  walking up the steps and watching over the valley was honestly amazing  you walk through a forest and the top is filled with temples and great scenery  just like the castle ruins in sendai  it turned from a little snowstorm to clear skies  i was up there for about 2 or 3 hours just staring over the views  kept my bags in a coin locker while there      took a train to  sakata  and since i was in yamadera quite early  i had plenty of time to look around the city  stayed in this place called  wakaba ryokan  guy at the reception speaks perfect english  explored around the world a bit and a really nice guy  walked around and ate some lunch at a cafe before moving on to  sankyo soko  some old rice warehouses  cool to see since sakata was home to the honma family  one of the richest families in japan prior to wwii  i then visited the  honma residence  of which was a really nice experience since it waspletely empty except for me  really well preserved and one of the women that worked there came and spoke with me for a bit which was nice  i then walked across the city towards  iimoriyama park  walk there was nice since you have to cross this long bridge that overlooks a huge river  spent some time there and ate at a  sukiya  before going to bed  if i hadn t slept early  i would have definitely tried to visit  iiyama san  a 90 something year old bartender who is a legend among japanese bartenders       tl dr   visited yamadera  would definitely try and visit if near  beautiful scenery  arrived in sakata  home of the richest family in japan prior to wwii  honma residence and sankyo soko  old rice warehouses  are well preserved and nice to see  iimoriyama park is also nice to walk around   thursday  20 feb      went to  akita  as a stop off to  yokote  ate at a place called  akita gyugentai  which offered a delicious course of beef  the place was a yakiniku or bbq restaurant and quite popular  so get there early or make a reservation  afterwards  visited  senshu park  which housed some nice old buildings  a watchtower i believe and a nice japanese garden  visiting the park was pretty much all the time i had and so took a train bound for yokote  stayed at the  yokote plaza hotel  visited  yokote castle  and the surrounding area  full of snow  knee high in the park area at some points but really nice to see and walk around      i would have gone to sleep at this time but i m glad i didn t since i visited a bar named  kizuna bar  got there when it opened and so was alone with the bartender for about an hour and a half and it was honestly the best  if you are in or near yokote  i would rend highly to go to this bar  the drinks are extremely well made by the master bartender who is both kind and attentive  unfortunately  i didn t speak much japanese and he didn t speak much english  but we both used google translate to make conversation  you can tell how much passion he has for the craft and was a very interesting and genuinely nice guy to talk to  the bar is designed really well  and looks great  the atmosphere is weing and can be full of life after dark  there is a huge variety of drinks  from beers to cocktails of all bases  tequila  gin  whiskey  vodka  brandy  the drinks list is endless  prices are fantastic too and for the service you are getting pared to some prices in tokyo for example  it can t be beat  in the end  i had six drinks  a white lady  a gin and tonic  a cosmopolitan  a fuzzy navel  a frozen daiquiri  and an orange blossom  all delicious  i wanted to go to eat dinner after this but i was a bit tired so went to bed       tl dr   visited akita  ate some yakiniku and visited senshu park  afterwards  stayed in yokote  visited the park and castle and stayed all night at a bar  amazing drinks  amazing bartender   friday  21 feb      was staying the night at  osawa onsen sansuikaku  so i decided to get to  kakunodate  early and look around  kept my bags in a coin locker and looked around the  samurai district  and the surrounding area  i didn t actually head inside any of the houses though since i opted to walk up to the top of the park in kakunodate and it was amazing  stayed up there for about an hour or so just staring across the view  flat land mixed with little hills here and there was just a sight to see  before leaving  i ate at an udon noodles place and it was delicious  probably the best udon i ve had during my entire stay in japan  the place was called  kosen dong  and was placed near the samurai district and had a nice traditional feel to it  plus the person who ran it was really nice      took a train to  hanamaki  where i had to take a shuttle bus to the onsen itself pared to my other aodation  this was quite expensive  cost about 125 pounds or so  17191 67 yen  but for the experience  it was worth it  plus you get a pretty nice dinner and breakfast so i can tplain  i ve never been in an onsen before and thus it was a bit weird with the whole naked thing but after about literally 10 minutes  i didn t mind  everyone there is minding their own business and nobody is looking at your parts on purpose so i found no reason to be ufortable  the ryokan makes their dinner based on the season  and they give you alot  i couldn t finish it all to be honest  the staff is really nice and weing  plus the ryokan has a wide variety of baths including private ones if you are ufortable  i spent most of my time in their famous outdoor bath of which had a lovely view over the river and the 200 year old building on the other side       tl dr   visited kakunodate  nice place with a samurai district  amazing views from park  stayed in ryokan  nice food and baths   saturday  22 feb      took the shuttle bus from the ryokan back to hanamaki and took travelled to  hirosaki  unfortunately i arrived about an hour later than expected due to train delays  and upon arriving  checked into the  hirosaki park hotel  i then ate at a cafe named  cembalo  which offered a delicious honey and cinnamon toast  unfortunately  it was raining the whole day pretty heavily  and so visiting the  hirosaki park and castle  was a bit worse than if it was clear but it was still a nice experience  i spent the rest of the day in this place called  pub grandpa  had six drinks  a manhattan  a salty dog  a gin fizz  a peach fizz  a scewdriver and a black russian and they were all delicious considering the fact that the bartender was never trained by anyone  i also had a steak and an apple pie  of which hirosaki is famous for  he spoke english really well and enjoys harry potter  having some wands on the walls and the famous owl painted on the wall as well  i met two really nice older japanese women and we spoke for a while before heading to another bar before i headed home for the night       tl dr   hirosaki was nice  saw the castle and the park  unfortunately it was raining but the day was saved by a place named pub grandpa  great guy  great drinks   sunday  23 feb      took a train to  hiraizumi  and explored around the town for a while  i opted to walk instead of taking a bus to  chuson ji  one of their most famous temples and walked back and visited  kanjizai in  a park with the lake built in the shape of a crane  really relaxing and nice to walk around  again  i kept my bags in a coin locker  these things are amazingly useful before heading to  ichinoseki  didn t really do much there since it was dark but ate at an izakaya  this place was nice since it had private booths so i had an entire room for myself to just chill and eat  the place was called  neneya  and was very reasonably priced  went to sleep at my hotel  the  hotel sunroute ichinoseki  if anyone does visit  i ve heard good things about a place called   cafe dining  where you can relive your childhood a bit by eating food from that period in little sizes  seemed cool but i opted for the place near me       tl dr   hiraizumi is a nice historical town full of temples  great to explore   monday  24 feb      travelled to tokyo as a stop off to nozawa onsen since i had some time  beware if you are stopping off in tokyo and want to store your bags for a short while  all of the coin lockers were taken  it took me about 45 minutes before i found one  i was so happy  walked around ginza and decided to have a nice lunch so i opted for a teppenyaki lunch  ate at this place called  teppenyaki 10 ginza  and it was delicious  though to be honest  i d rather spend much less on a bigger  cheaper steak than more on this sort of stuff  though that s just my opinion on the matter  then took the shinkansen to  nozawa onsen  the place i stayed was called  new hoshiba  and it was about a 20 30 walk to the center of town and the lifts but i didn t really mind walking too much  however  the woman there is extremely nice and offered to drive me in the mornings  i was there late since i had a lesson in the morning and thus if i arrived  even on the earliest train  collecting my equipment and so forth  i might have missed it  so opted to play it safe  went around to a couple bars  the main one called  bar rotus root nozawa  nice guy  bartender for 28 years and been in nozawa for about 11  drinks were nice and again  well priced  bit out of the way of town but would rend       tl dr   stopped off in tokyo and had a teppenyaki lunch before heading to nozawa onsen  check out a few bars  went to sleep   tuesday  25 feb      had breakfast and picked up my equipment  rented from this place called  sports thanx  right next to the slopes and nice staff  i ve never snowboarded before so i had a morning lesson where i learned the basics and met a singaporean couple of whom i had thought were about 22 or 23  only to figure out were 35  those guys don t age  we basically hung out for the day and the next and were really nice to just talk with  i d rend a group lesson for this reason and the fact that it s like 3 times cheaper  i did take a private lesson on the second day though  for the reason that they had no group lessons available  i spent the whole day on the slopes before heading back to my hotel  showering and relaxing for a bit before heading out to more bars  i went to about 5 but the last one i was at was probably the nicest  was called  stay bar  and the guy working there  was canadian  was cool to talk to  the atmosphere of the place was nice as well and they played some good music       tl dr   took a group lesson  met a singaporean couple  really nice  spent day on slopes before heading into town and checking out some more bars   wednesday  26 feb      went to the slopes early in the morning for the first lifts to open  took a private lesson which was immensely helpful in me figuring out how to do turns  ate some lunch in a restaurant on the slopes  it was this one run that i basically did the whole day  it was called the  paradise run  and it was a really great green run to learn what i needed to  by the end of the day  i had gotten the hang of doing c turns i though was great  will be going to some indoor snow centres here in england when i can to practice more  before i left  i had what was probably one of the best burgers i ve ever had  the place was called  genki burger  and it was delicious  unfortunately i had it as a takeaway since i had a bus to catch to take me back to the station  got to tokyo  check into my hostel  imano hostel cafe bar shinjuku  and went to sleep       tl dr   learned how to do c turns via a private lesson and staying on the slopes for the rest of the day  had an amazing burger  went to tokyo   thursday  27 feb      first day in tokyo i looked around where i was staying  which was shinjuku  walked around the area before heading to the  gyoen national garden  it s a 500 yen entrance fee but it s worth it  the garden is huge and very well looked after  it s got a large greenhouse filled with some interesting plants and has a taiwanese pavilion that was gifted to japan sitting by a lake  also  i managed to see a cherry blossom for the first time in that park  i wasn t expecting to see any in my time there but there were two main ones that i managed to see and as expected  they looked great  i then walked to  yoyogi park  and visited   meji jingu  the park was great and the whole place has a really interesting story to read about  i would rend  i opted to forgoe going to shibuya though i was near since i d rather leave it to another day      the night consisted of going to  spirits bar sunface  a bar in shinjuku that is honestly worth the heavy price  the bartender won the don of tequila award and is amazing  there is no menu so you just tell him what you like and he ll make a drink off of that  i had four while i was there  one with a gin and pineapple base  one with a strawberry  herb and gin base  one with grape  tequila  marscapone cheese  et al  amp  one with apple  tequila  egg yolk et al  the grape and cheese one was probably my favourite  it was delicious and the foam that the grape and cheese formed was just heavenly to taste  all in all  i spent about 52 pounds  7300 yen  for the four drinks which is definitely quite a bit considering that in yokote  i spent 4000 yen on six drinks  but then again  this is tokyo in a popular area in a popular bar and the drinks are custom made so i can tplain       tl dr   explored shinjuku and the gyoen national park and yoyogi park and meji jingu  ended the night at spirits bar sunface  no menu  you tell him what you like and he makes it  great experience   friday  28 feb      second day consisted of going to ginza where i looked around near the  imperial palace  and the surrounding area  didn t do too much so i headed towards the  tokyo edo museum  of which i expected to take about an hour or so but overall i spent about 3 or 4 hours  the museum is huge and full of a ton of information about tokyo and it s growth from the edo period to the current city it is now  if you have some hours to spare and are a fan of history  i would definitely go  i also visited the nearby  yokoami cho park  of which has a really tragic past and the  former yasuda park  a beautiful japanese garden  looking back  i should have gone to the  japanese sword museum  nearby but i had forgotten at the time      in the night  i headed to the  golden gai  i had walked by some of the african dudes trying to get you into their bar  but they seem harmless  one guy followed me for about a minute but after i basically laughed in his face and continuously telling him that i m good  he eventually left me  another followed a minute after but left in about 30 seconds after i shut down any conversation he tried to make  the golden gai was pretty cool but not somewhere i d visit again  i went to two bars  the first being the  albatross  of which had a nice selection of drinks  looked cool and the guy was nice so i d rend going for the first perhaps  the second one was where it was interesting  it was called  bar bali  and went i went in  it was just the bartender and a japanese businessman  in the end  i was there for about an hour and a half since i started up a conversation with this businessman and the bartender helping tounicate since he was interested in me going to tohoku  he bought me a huge glass of sake and then paid for my entire bill  something like 4 5000 yen which i denied  but he wouldn t take no for an answer  in the end he gave me his business card  turns out this guy is the president of a big real estate business in roppongi  surprised  i left shortly after he did and went home       tl dr   looked around ginza and went to the tokyo edo museum and surrounding parks  ignored the african scammers and went to the golden gai  met a businessman who paid for my drinks   saturday  29 feb      on this day  i opted to visit  akihabara  not for the reason of anime or anything since i m not the biggest fan  but for the experience and looking around  it was a bit ufortable for me at first to be honest but as time went on it got better  before that however  i had breakfast at this place called  a happy pancake  it is quite popular but fortunately i didn t have to wait long and to be honest  it was delicious  bananas and cream with pancakes was just heavenly  i was craving pancakes so having them was the best  after this  i went to the area near  tokyo tower  where i stared from a nearby park for quite some time  it was in the evening so it looked great with all the lights  afterwards  i decided to go to a club called  a life  in roppongi  i m not the biggest fan of clubs but i like just vibing to the music so i opted to go  the price was pretty good and you can get three drinks with the entrance fee before 11 i believe it was so i decided to go  it was pretty much dead until about 1 but it was definitely interesting  there was some old guy there  maybe in his 70s or so who was not one of the creepy types but was just genuinely happy to just dance around to the music  didn t disturb anyone and made some friends by the time i d left  there were some bad experiences though  one of which being two guys who i saw throughout the night  maybe in their 30s going around touching women who obviously didn t want to be touched before falling back into the crowd and trying again with someone else  kind of awful  the second was me getting hit hard in the side of the head by something  i don t know what it was but i turned around and saw nothing  i got hit in the temple and it hurt something awful  still hurts now whenever i move my mouth or go to touch it  after that  i decided to leave  it was about 4 and the trains were long gone so i decided to walk to the  rainbow bridge  where i saw the sun rise  it was an amazing thing to see but i was exhausted  the walking the previous day  the dancing and the walking to the bridge took a toll on my feet so i took a train home and slept for about 4 hours before heading out for the next day       looked around akihabara and the tokyo tower area  went to a club in roppongi  walked to the rainbow bridge and saw the sun rise   sunday  1 march      woke up pretty exhausted from the previous night so took it a bit easy  went to  harajuku  and looked around for a while before having one of the better pizzas i ve ever had in this place called  kevelos  i sat on the counter so i saw the chef stretch the dough out  and add the toppings before sending it into the pizza oven  so eating it just felt that much better  i checked out the  oriental bazaar  that was nearby of which does have some pretty nice souvenirs so head over there if you can if you want something      at night  i went to ginza  since i love the look of high rise buildings lit up  just makes you feel so small and i get really amazed by those sights  i had udon noodles with tempura in a place called  sato yosuke  and while the price was good and the servings were huge  i didn t think that it was the best udon i had while in japan  still pretty good though  and the location and atmosphere was great  after that  i went to  star bar ginza  the bar is extremely well designed and the bartenders all very professional and great at what they do  i had three drinks there and met another singaporean couple of which  again  i thought were about my age but instead in their 30s  we talked for a while before departing at about 10 30 or so  myself heading home since i didn t get the best sleep the previous night  while i would rend the place for the experience  i paid about 45 pounds  6200 yen  for three drinks  and while that seems alright for the location  i would rather go to spirits bar sunface since the drinks are custom made and a bit cheaper       tl dr   visited harajuku  had one of the best pizzas at a place called kevelos  went to ginza in the evening  eating udon noodles and visiting star bar ginza  meeting another singaporean couple   monday  2 march      this was my last day and it essentially consisted on me going and buying souvenirs  nothing fancy  headed to haneda airport at about 2 for my flight home       tl dr   bought souvenirs  flight home ,1

thinking of going osaka  usj  if it reopens  umeda  dotonbori  is there anywhere else i shouldn t miss kuromon markets was wholly underwhelming for me inparison to nishiki markets in kyoto so i will give it a miss this time hiroshima miyajima  this will be a day trip starting pretty early in the morning and heading straight for miyajima  shrine  having an oyster lunch and heading back to hiroshima for the peace museum  if open  or wander around the peace park please share any rendations for food places or interesting sights  i am excited to have a setouchi lemon pudding again haha

restaurant style places during my last trip kobe  please rend some nice beef places you went to  last time i just wandered into a random one on the street and unfortunately i forgot the name of it is the herb garden worth going in spring  also  is kitanocho worth visiting  i don t have much incentive to go to the port kobe area seeing as yokohama is the best port  fight me  but please prove me wrong what other prefectures should i go to  is okayama worth visiting  the bf and i like wine and fruits march 23rd check out  buy snacks ekiben  shinkansen to odawara  train to hakone yumoto in time

likely also chill around ikebukuro  akihabara  shinjuku  odaiba maybe  go down to yokohama one last time for the memories  harajuku is literally hell on earth for me so will likely avoid it what other food places should we check out in tokyo  which michelin ramens are worth waiting for  i enjoy  fancy  food but also like going to saizeriya  gasuto etc  so any nice budget places wouldn t go amiss april 2nd check out of hotel  one last romp around shibuya etc before getting bags and heading to haneda for the flight home april 3rd arrive home and start my 2 week quarantine anyway that seems to be it for now  i ll go back to obsessively checking coronavirus case counts and praying for no travel ban  thank you in advance for your suggestions ,1
planning to undertake the shikoku pilgrimage beginning in may  first big trip  any advice wee ,hey all  i also posted in solotravel  and they rended i talk to you folks  some of the stories i ve read here have been wonderful  and inspire me more to take this trip i ve rarely travelled outside of canada  never to a predominantly non english country  i m sort of doing this out of the blue  for personal reasons  if anyone is unaware  the shikoku pilgrimage is a 1200km hike around the island of shikoku  which visits 88 buddhist temples along the way i m looking for advice regarding getting by while in japan  maybe how best to approach local customs and courtesies that i may know nothing about  i wish to be as respectful as possible to the people who s home i want to visit i ve looked into a route guidebook  that seems to be a staple among some pilgrims  which assists with maps  routes  locations of shops  lodgings  atms  etc  it seems to be an excellent resource in regard to the pilgrimage itself  but if anyone has some insight or personal anecdotes to offer it would mean a lot and any advice regarding how i can prepare  be it physically  mentally  spiritually  what have you  in the weeks approaching may would be weei have a relatively open budget  as i have been saving for something like this for a while  i don t plan to live like a king but don t plan to beg eitherand really any advice ya ll can think of would be appreciated  i ve just recently made thisitment and i m trying to wrap my head around everything as best as i canps  i understand very little about what is going on with covid 19  though a few folks rended i keep away from japan because of the outbreak  insight regarding this would also be very appreciated,1

what city has the most traditional architecture ,i plan on visiting japan in a few months on a vacation and wanted to visit a city which has the most traditional japanese architecture  most of the photos i see online that show traditional architecture other than the small towns are in the city centres  castles  temples but i want to go to a city where large portion of the houses have that traditional style to them too  sort of like york in the uk which has a lot normal houses as well as castles and other landmarks that are in traditional english styles like tudor and georgian but like the japanese version if you know what i mean ,1
hiroshima   barestaurant ondo  well hidden gem ,a few weeks ago i found myself strolling through nagarekawa  the entertainment district of hiroshima  i saw lights everywhere and heard loud musicing from clubs around me  i did not feel like entering one of theercial clubs and checked the internet for any bars that played vinyl music  as most bars in japan are not located on ground floor it can sometimes be hard to look for a nice place while walking on the street  i found a bar called ondo on the map  and took a 5 minute walk to get there  it is located below an onsen  at  1 level  and well hidden if you don t know it exists  when i walked in i was greeted very weing with a little bit of surprise  the owner  who speaks very good english  and his wife did not really understand how i found their bar  the bar is known by locals for its great izakaya  bar style  food  it is a restaurant around dinner time and a bar after  but is not often visited by tourists  the owner has a very impressive record collection  ranging from ambient to jazz and house disco  they also sell some records  the atmosphere and warmth that i felt in this bar was what made it so special  the couple is very passionate about running the bar  and pay great attention to detail  they had a great selection of affordable local sak s  try ryusei if they still have it  and some special rice crackers on the house  if you are ever in hiroshima try out this bar and i m almost certain you will have the same experience that i had ,1

hokkaido tohoku or tohoku only in 12 days ,hi all  i m soft planning for my winter trip next year  this will be my fifth trip to japan and i have already visited all the major tourist cities attractions in kanto  chubu  kansai  chugoku  and a portion of kyushu  so i m planning to go north this time  i alsoe from a tropical country so snow would be a major point plus to me after a bit of preliminary research  it looks like hokkaido and tohoku are very vast and transports between cities attractions are pretty slow and infrequent  note that i m a relatively fast traveller  i finished all the major spots in kyoto within 2 days so far i have listed the spots below to visit in hokkaido   sapporo   otaru   niseko   lake toya   amp   noboribetsu   asahikawa   hakodate   would love to visit  furano  but i don t think it s really a winter spot   would love to visit  abashiri  but it s so far  even from asahikawa and here are the spots in tohoku   aomori   amp   hirosaki   lake tazawa   amp   nyuto onsen   akita   yamagata   sendai   amp   matsushima   fukushima if i were to go to tohoku only  without hokkaido  i was thinking of adding an extra 1 2 days in  aomori  to go to  mount hakkoda   amp   lake towada  and  tsugaru  i could also add  hiraizumi  and other stuff in  iwate  i could also spend an extra day to go to  mount zao  in  yamagata  if i have an empty day i could probably visit  niigata  too  though i m not sure what to do there  but yeah i wonder if those places are worth it my aim when travelling to japan is to visit the popular or even  hidden gem  tourist spots there  this time i would like to try skiing but it s not a very high priority for me  i generally like nature outdoor stuff so i m fine with mild hiking  i am also looking forward to tasting the local and unique culinary of the area i would be really grateful if those with experience in those regions help chime in  thanks in advance ,1

february 2020 trip report  tokyo   kyoto   tokyo,hi everyone i hadn t intended to write a trip report but i thought it might be helpful for those on the fence about traveling amidst the coronavirus news  we just returned last night after a little over a week in japan general thoughts  we definitely agonized a bit over whether it was worth going  in the end we would have lost quite a bit of cash with cancellations so we decided to go anyway  we definitely took precautions  we used an insane amount of hand sanitizer and wipes   even wiped down atm s before using  we decided to bike  or take taxis rather than use public transportation as a way of minimizing risk  i would definitely take it into consideration what your return trip could be like  with some airlines starting to cancel flights back  and how yourpany will inevitably react to your return  my girlfriend and i are both on mandatory two week quarantines by our respectivepanies  we both work in digital design so this isn t a big deal  just working from home for a couple of weeks to make sure we don t unintentionally infect coworkers  honestly we probably would have done this anyway  most things were still open  but we did miss the design museum which was closed because of the virus  that was a real bummer as it was one of the things we were looking forward to  what was nice was that every restaurant we had planned that typically has a line  did not  we were able to walk in most places easily   other than one udon place in shinjuku that strangely still had a long line full of tourists  udon shin  overall it was hard to tell there was a virus happening  people were wearing masks but that s typicallyon across asia  probably the big difference was seeing foreigners wearing masks  however i d still say only about 60 70 percent of people were wearing masks  on the actual tourism side many people rended doing more days in kyoto  i have to say i disagree  kyoto was absolutely beautiful  but tokyo was just out of this world  we ve both been before for work but this was a special treat to be able to really explore different neighborhoods outside of shibuya shinjuku days 1 2 tokyo  flew from nyc to atlanta  to narita  took the airport limousine bus to my hotel  was staying at the hilton in shinjuku mainly because i could use hotel points  and i ve stayed there before for work and it s pretty nice  our first couple of days were just getting settled  we had sushi at sushi zanmai higashi shinjuku which is great for mid priced sushi  i ve been there before on work trips and they re always really nice and have english language menus  the 2nd day we walked through the antique market in shinjuku  and then the farmers market by the un building  they have an amazing pork vendor there that sells cuts of pork with rice balls  highly rend that market if you re into food cooking  then dinner at ramen afuri  love the yuzu chicken ramen there day 3   4 kyoto  we took the bullet train from tokyo station to kyoto and dropped our bags  this was our big splurge of the trip so we were staying at tawaraya ryokan  can t rend this place enough  it was pricey but worth every penny  each room has butler service that serves your meals  and brings your beds in every night  unlike any hotel inn experience i ve ever had  they also had wood soaking tubs in each room  was so incredible to soak in those tubs after walking all day  since dinnebreakfast was included we had two great lunches in kyoto  first was at kyoto gogyo  which was burnt miso style ramen  one of the best bowls of ramen i ve ever had  such a unique flavor  and honke owariya historic soba noodle restaurant  just an fyi there were a lot of things closed  not because of the virus  just many places are closed on monday tuesdays in kyoto  we should have researched this better because we missed out on a few places i was dying to try  like sake bar yoramu which has one of the best sake lists in japan  also artbooks yamazaki  which i ve heard is one of the best bookstores in japan for art design books day 5   8 tokyo  too many great experiences in tokyo to write about here but our highlights      we stayed in an airbnb that was a little apartment built in 1948  it was so cool  made entirely from wood and thatch  it s called the tokyo little house  and it has a cafe next door  it s in the akasaka area  the owners were so nice      we rented tokyo bikes and rode them around the yanaka neighborhood  cannot rend this enough  what a beautiful neighborhood  it was gorgeous  we had so many great experiences there  great lunch at cibi  and a refreshing beer at the yanaka beer hall tucked into an alley      we had one fancy dinner at sushi isana and we were the only ones  i felt really bad for the chef owner because he said nearly half his reservations had cancelled  the meal was incredible but i hope tourism picks up again soon  it s been hard on businesses like his      the best meal we had in japan was at kome kome  i m into natural wines  and sake and had read about this place in an article written by alice fering  thank god i read that article because it was our best meal  it s a tiny little place with 6 seats in a very local feeling neighborhood  he asked us how hungry we were  we told him medium  he just started bringing out dishes and sake for us to try  each dish was incredible  not a place to get stuffed but such an incredible meal      we had dinners snacks a couple of times at ittenbari ramen  mostly because it was cheap  fast  easy  and delicious  really good fried rice  gyoza  and miso ramen  the portions are massive      the shopping was just mindblowing  we had to buy a spare suitcase because we bought so many beautiful things  we re both designers and are really into product design and japan is just next level in that area  we got a beautiful knife from ubukeya  family has been making cutting instruments since 1763  some amazing notebooks from loft  and kakimori  and i was able to get some games for my switch you can only buy in japan played dynasty warriors on the plane home  it s cheesy but i love it all in all such an incredible trip and worth the two week self quarantine  i m no medical professional and i can t make any rendations on whether you should travel considering the news  but i can say we did still have an amazing time and i would say the affect on our travel was minimal  big thanks to everyone in this subreddit that helped us plan  especially some of the advice given on biking  that was one of the highlights of our trip  tokyo is such a fun city to bike in ,1

 itinerary  3 11 3 18  osaka  amp  tokyo  flight story,i ll start this by saying i have all intents of going on this trip unless the cdc raises japan to level 3  or if the airline cancels my trip ok  on to the flight story  i booked with american airlines  and the long flights are ran by japan airlines  i originally booked about a month and half ago  prices had risen at that time and there was little threat  i recently watched flight prices tumble  so i called the airline to see what kind of deal i could get i spoke with a person very familiar with japan travel  he informed me that i would unfortunately not be able to get a cancel change fee waived  he was very helpful and researched information for me and did let me know  i could still save hundreds by rebooking on another similar flight  i would still have to pay the fee  600 for 2 tickets  i understood his position and tried to be as nice as possible through the whole transaction so here s the breakdown of costs  i originally booked for 2 for a round trip flight at  3 000  i canceled this trip and he told me i would be refunded  2 400 directly to my card  600 for the cancel charge the new flight was about  1 750 total  so i would still save about  700 by rebooking here s the kicker  the refund transaction got posted to my account today for the full amount  the cancel fee was not included  i think he may have  inadvertently  forgot to apply the charge  he was a really nice guy  be nice and courteous to people no matter what  they usually have little control  but you never know as for our itinerary itself  we plan to fly into kix and meet with our friend who teaches english  japanese native  and his son  we ve done this before and we usually just walk around and do whatever he suggests  sometime we let him know we want to do certain things  like maid cafe or arcade and he handles the logistics  it makes it really easy on us haha after 3 nights  we re all taking a bullet train to tokyo  we re staying in ginza there  i m not too worried about all of the closures  my wife is mostly interested in shopping  and i am most interested in eating their delicious food  we do some touristy things  but i believe most of the shops and restaurants will still be open well  let me know what you guys think and if you have any questions ,1

any luck with jal s free trip promotion , amp x200b hi  first time posting here i ve been keeping tabs on japan airline s free domestic flight promotion since january  since the time of opening the promo request page  i ve been checking their site every day at exactly 00 00jst as they have stated  sometimes some minutes earlier  and other times i check once every hour i have experience with queues but i am wondering if anyone else has been trying to search for destinations on jal s promo page  and if they ve been able to click  travel to one of the places shown above  button  i ve been unable to place a request due to  heavy traffic  and hitting the maximum daily application of 250  which i assume is cumulative from all internet users even when i check at 23 59  00 00  or 00 01jst  i still get  requests are closed for today  it hasn t been a week since this promo  so it s still pretty early to see  but i like to be safe than sorry and ask on here to see if anyone s gotten seats if i get a seat  i ll post an update here if i remember to post amp x200b side note  i am concerned about this promo as there seems to be no pre requirement besides being a jmb member and how you don t have to show proof that you ll even be in japan to enter  until the flight  where some excited people who don t even have tickets to japan may be taking those seats  what happens when they cancel last minute and people who are actually in japan at the time missed those seats they could have had  just a concern saying edit  additional information  i ve been choosing haneda as my departure  which i ll predict is the most popular choice  and selecting the earliest arrival and latest departure  also i am in usa  wondering if selecting these affects my chances  what have you guys selected ,1

9 nights osaka  fukuoka  kyoto  kamakura itinerary check,yet another generic itinerary check  wanted to post to see if there might be anything i am overlooking or if any of the logistical stuff doesn t make sense   doing 7 day jr pass from sunday saturday  a couple of the changes i ve made since initially planning it was to skip a stop in miyajima on the way to fukuoka  only getting 2 nights in fukuoka and the logistics of a trip to miyajima and getting to fukuoka in one day seemed like it was too much  especially with the torii gate under renovation  figured it would be better to just maximize time in fukoka  the other change was to spend the last night in kamakura instead of shinjuku  we are flying out of haneda as it was cheaper but we have spent extensive time in tokyo in the past so we decided that we d like to see some place new that last night and settled on staying in kamakura  figured if we decide we do want to spend a little time in tokyo before leaving we always could   amp x200b friday 4 3  land kansai 2pm  pickup wifi  activate jr pass for sunday  head to hotel in dotonbori  eat dinner  walk around  no real plans as we ll be wiped from flightsaturday 4 4  osaka  check out osaka castle  cruise minami kita dotonbori areas  was thinking possibly going to orix buffaloes chiba lotte marines game at osaka dome 2pm  not sure though due to possibly virus restrictions    food tour 7 10pmsunday 4 5  fukuoka  head to fukuoka on shinkansen  9 or 10 am  arriving noon or 1pm  check out tenjin district  get lunch at ichiran main branch  possibly find a sports bar to watch f1 vietnam gp at 4pm  dinner res  at hakata motsunabe yamanaka monday 4 6  fukuoka  am walking tour of hakata area  hang out afternoon at  uminonakamichi seaside park  fukuoka food tour in eveningtuesday  4 7  fukoka  himeji  kobe  kyoto  explore fukuoka in morning  take shinkansen to himeji around noon  spend 2 3 hours at himeji  take shinkansen to shin kobe  5 30 dinner reservation at wakkoqu shinkobe for kobe beef  head to hotel in kyotowednesday  4 8  kyoto  spend day exploring arashiyma area  mokey park etc    evening kyoto food tourthursday 4 9  kyoto  visit nijo castle in morning  kyoto bike tour in afternoon to eveningfriday 4 10  fushimi inari nara  head to fushimi inari en route to nara in am  1pm nara bike tour  diner in nara before heading back to kyotosaturday 4 11  kyoto to kamakura  morning train to kamakura   spend afternoon exploring enoshima areasunday 4 12 kamakura  departure  spend day exploring sites in kamakura   head to haneda for 6pm flight home,1

late may to late june tentative itinerary   one month   newly married couple of first timers  would love advice ,hello  reading this posts in thisunity has been a godsend  thank you all so much  my husband and i are embarking on a one month honeymoon trip to japan this summer  we re getting the jr pass and thought that  since we re flying in and out of tokyo  found great price  it would be easiest to follow the rails southwest from tokyo down to hiroshima  i m getting really close to the time i need to start booking aodations and i have several questions  so here is our itinerary that we ve sculpted around some festivals we read about  i am a teacher and he s a server   we aren t made of money  we are really traveling on a budget  and happy with that  and in fact are even hoping to couchsurf for certain times  probably when the festivals are  our biggest expenses will be the flying and jr pass  we re really excited about everything from city life to night life to museums to temples and shrines   my husband was a religious studies major and is excited to experience japan s spirituality and religion  we don t care for anime theme cafes etc  we love to walk around and explore and just take things in  find ourselves wherever questions  i m sorry if i have too many is it easier to base in one place to see several cities or travel and stay in different places as we bop down the coast   so  should we stay in  5 places or  10 to see the same amount of cities where is the best place to stay in a less expensive ryokan  where would be the best place to stay in a hostel  where would be the best place to couchsurf and get to know someone who could show us around where would be the best spot to rent bikes and bike around to explore for a whole day sidenote  i m vegan and will probably give that up for being in japan   from what i can tell  besides where the monks are  it is really tough and i don t want to spend the whole trip hunting for food instead of enjoying the experience  am i wrong to your knowledge my biggest issues are with the last half of the trip   experienced travelers  what should we nix or prioritize more  this is all so new and i m doing lots of research but there is just so much to figure out  should i just nix okayama  it seems like there isn t a ton to do there  if this is too many questions on one post  please answer any 1 you even feelfortable with and i will be so appreciative  i m brand new to international travel and japan  though i ve been researching and learning about it for a while and trying to learn language via several apps for several years   place main  interests arrive depart tokyo exploring neighborhoods  harajuku  museums  nightlife  perhaps a day trip to a beach 7 30 may 28 june 2 hakone  get hakone free pass  open air museum  springs june 2 june 4 nagoya  atsuta matsuri festival june 4  june 6 nara shrines and burial mounds  gardens  deer june 6 june 8 kyoto all things ancient and temples and shrines june 8 june 12 osaka  rice planting festival june 12 june 15 okayama june 15 june 17  naoshima  art island day trip from okayama onomichi  temple walk  shimanami kaido june 17 june 20 hiroshima peace museum june 20 june 23 miyajima torii gate day trip from hiroshima himeji  yukata festival june 23 june 25 tokyo depart tokyo 11 30pm thank you again and any advice is wee ,1
what just happened here ,while eating in a gyu tan restaurant  toshi  in morioka  my husband and i started conversing with a japanese man seated beside us via what little english he knew and translation apps on our phones  he said he was from miyago and was also in morioka for sightseeing  we talked about the three great noodle dishes  and when he found out we haven t tried reimen  he suggested we go to this restaurant near the station to try it  using his phone  he translates  i will treat you   if not disturbing  and  once in a lifetime chance  we thought  fudge it  and said sure  we didn t realize that he paid for our dinner  and when we insisted on paying him back  he refused and said  i have a lot of money we step out and share a cab to the station  the restaurant  seiroukaku  was on the 2nd floor of a busyercial building  he ordered beef yakiniku which we grilled on the table and got two bowls of reimen  one for my husband and one for me  we apologized that we couldn t finish it because we were full from the gyu tan and insisted on treating him this time but he refuses again  he eventually mentions that he s 50 years old and we both act surprised because he looks younger  we re asians as well so we tell him that we re actually both 35 and we also look young for our age  he acts surprised then  shortly after  he shows us a translation on his phone that says   you can leave now  both weirded out  we smile and laugh and apologize again for not finishing our bowls  collect our things  and said goodbye  as we were leaving  i saw him reach for my unfinished bowl of reimen so  what just happened here  i m so curious as to what his intentions were  can anyone help us figure out why he shooed us away the moment he found out we were in our mid 30s ,1
gyukatsu in shibuya with low wait time ,i ve read a lot about gyukatsu motomura and noted that there are several in the shibuya area  my only reservation is that i don t want to wait an hour out of a busy schedule to get a seat  is there one in particular that is less busy than others or a quieter alternative that serves gyukatsu ,1
parents with orthopedic needs and removing shoes indoors,hi all i m planning a trip in 2021 that tentatively hits tokyo  kyoto  himeji  and a ryokan stay in hakone  however  i learned that my mid to late 50 s parents who will be apanying me on this trip cannot handle being without shoes for more than five minutes or else it starts hurting their backs  i d like to aodate them as much as possible  but i m a little unclear on what  if any alternatives exist for places with wooden floors that don t allow outdoor shoes  like the interior of himeji or any ryokans  so far the best idea we cane up with is to bring a set of brand new  inside only shoes  or to try out variousbinations of socks wrapped around layered insoles  however  i ve heard that places like ryokans and himeji  which are especially focused on preservation  don t allow shoes at all  as they would damage the floors  if this is true  can anyone give me any alternatives we could use in terms of footwear  or does himeji and some ryokans now allow indoor only shoes in place of bare feet and or slippers ,1

february 2020 hokkaido trip report,hey everyone  this sub has been helpful for my recent trip to hokkaido  so i thought i d post my trip report too  i ll go into detail about the things we did  and feel free toent if you have any questions  please let me know if you have any feedback about this trip report as a whole  as i want to get better at writing these trip album general info    check if your phone planes with international roaming  many of t mobile s planse with free 2g in japan  which is enough   face it  you don t need to be on the internet that much  the one thing you would need internet for are maps  it s helpful to download offline maps for wherever you need to go in advance so you don t have to sit and wait for the maps to load  even if your debit card charges a fee for using an out of network atm  chances are high that using 7 bank  or lawson s  atms for getting japanese yen is cheaper than ordering yen through your bank or bringing cash and converting it at the airport  credit cards are accepted more often than not but it felt good to handle money and know how much you really are spending  just knowing how to read hiragana katakana is largely enough  especially for reading from a japanese menu  masks are sold out in pretty much all convenience stores  i probably didn t wait as long as usual for certain experiences  because there were fewer tourists due to coronavirus fears  pack light or pack an extra suitcase on your way there  you ll need space for snacks and souvenirs hokkaido info  suica is accepted in around the sapporo area and hakodate  but not in between  you can board a jr train at sapporo with suica  but you can t ride that train to oshamambe hakodate and expect to get off with suica   you ll have to talk to a train station agent  even though hokkaido is missing much of their snow this year  there was still plenty of ice slush on the ground  if you go to hokkaido in the winter  try not to miss the winter festivals  we didn t have a choice as our vacation time was limited to a predetermined week of vacation time my partner got  so the only winter festival we were able to hit was the last day of the otaru canal lights 16 2 2020  sfo  gt  tpe  gt  cte  gt  otaru  kinotoya bake soft serve and cheese tarts  luggage storage near otaru station  otaru canal lights  sawasakisuisan kaisenshokudoi had been reading about some issues with eva air s gates in sfo  namely the fact that there were two full eva 777 departures at 00 05 and 00 20 right next to each other  but i didn t find any issues with their boarding process  as a whole  eva s service is a step above any other typical american airline  it turned out that our flight from tpe to cte was on their sanrio branded aircraft  with plenty of sanrio decor after we landed in cte  we went straight for the kinotoya bake shop in cte and got their soft serve   this turned out to be the best soft serve i had throughout hokkaido  and definitely worth a stop  we took the jr express train to otaru  left our luggage in a bike shop close to otaru station  the station s coin lockers are day of only  and we wanted to walk around sakaimachi the next day without luggage  dropped our stuff off at our airbnb  and walked around otaru s canal lights  dinner was at sawakisuisan kaisenshokudo  a small donburi place right next to the canal  the bowls were pricy but delicious  especially the uni   17 2 2020  otaru  gt  sapporo  suiten shrine  sakaimachi  sankaku market  odori park sapporo clock towesapporo tv tower  soup curry garaku  tanukikoji it snowed heavily the night before  so the walk up to the shrine was covered in snow and some of the steps were dangerous  the view was worth it though  and we were the only ones there  we made our way back down to sakaimachi and walked through the various stores   letao  otaru music box museum  kitaichi glass  rokatei  and a couple food stalls along the way back to otaru station  sankaku market  right next to otaru station  was small and kind of underwhelming   but this may be due to myparisons with tsukiji market which was much more exciting we took the train back to sapporo and walked around  hopping from convenience store to convenience store as we saw the sights in and around odori park  we didn t enter the clock or tv towers  but they were a good sight from outside  for dinner  we had soup curry garaku   i highly rend this to anybody who s spending time in sapporo  it was probably the best meal  considering price  of this trip  we walked to tanukikoji on our way back to the hotel  with plenty of stores to look through 18 2 2020  sapporo  nijo market  sandria sandwiches  hanamaru sushi  shiroi koibito park ishiya chocolate factory  sapporo beer museumi woke up this morning at 5am really hungry  so i went to lawson s and got myself some delicious food  if only that were possible in the united states  we went to nijo market early in the morning and had some grilled scallops and oysters for much cheaper than we could find anywhere else  hakodate was twice as expensive  then rode the train to sandria for some sandwiches  if you go there  get the double egg sandwich   it s their best seller for a good reason  their other sandwiches were good  and the bread had a good texture to it  but the double egg was just better than all of the others  we rode the train back to sapporo station for hanamaru sushi and arrived 10 minutes before opening  but there was already a 45 minute line  if there were more tourists in hokkaido during this time  i m sure the wait would have been more than an hour  the fish was good and much cheaper than what you d find in the united states  but sadly they were sold out of ootoro  if you like japanese music  there s a big music store in the sapporo station building  and we picked up seven cds here we went to shiroi koibito park for our cookie making reservation  they accept reservations by phone the day before  but only in japanese  so it s probably easier to make an online reservation two days earlier  we got to build our shiroi koibito cookie  two cookies with white chocolate in the middle  and decorate it as our own  and the mini taster samples we made tasted fresh and delicious too  i m not usually a fan of white chocolate but their chocolate was good sapporo beer museum had a display of their old factory and the history of sapporo beer  my partner and i don t typically drink beer but we both agreed that this beer was better than other beer we ve had  it s a shame that the beers we tried aren t available in the us  we ate at the sapporo beer garden for our dinner  a nice hearty meal of genghis khan 19 2 2020  sapporo  gt  niseko annupuri  niseko annupuri ski resort  moku no showe took the goodsports white liner from sapporo to niseko  they also had a service for snowboard rental and would deliver the rentals in advance to your niseko aodation  which was very convenient  if anybody plans on taking a bus and renting a board for a short stay in niseko  i highly rend going with goodsports   everything was simple  annupuri had enough people to make it look active  but pretty much no line for the lifts  the snow was great  since about 2 feet of snow had fallen in the last three nights  i overheard that most people were on the other sides of niseko   grand hirafu and niseko village  annupuri is a great location for a beginner snowboarder to learn  as there are giant green runs that have a consistent slope with no flats  in general  annupuri seemed less steep  but for a challenge there were gated backcountry tree runs which were great  just try not to get rescued out there  as it ll cost you 100 000 yen we had to call for a taxi as we missed the last shuttle to the hotel  but niseko taxi was asking for 8 000 yen and an hour wait for a 5 minute ride  and two other taxipanies i called said they didn t have any service  i asked the annupuri ticket office who really helped me out with getting a local taxi to take me to the hotel  for just 1 200 yen  lesson learned  the locals will help you out if you just ask in person we stayed in moku no sho for the night  it was quite an experience with a private outdoor onsen  but pricy of course  dinner was a course meal at the hotel 20 2 2020  niseko annupuri  gt  lake toya  niseko station  oshamambe station  lake toya   illuminationsi chatted the night before with hotel front desk staff about faster ways to get to lake toya  but in the end we found that taking the train from niseko to oshamambe  then to toya was the fastest  there is a seasonal bus that services niseko gt toya but i had missed it by a week niseko station doesn t have much around it  but there s a heated waiting area at least  on the other hand  oshamambe had a 7 11 within walking distance  and we grabbed some mid afternoon snacks there  the days were clear in the morning  but by the time we got to toya  it was cloudy  so we couldn t see the picturesque mountain in the postcard view  there was a beautiful illumination at night though  with a speaker playing  last christmas  in february  unfortunately i missed the other winter festivities  like fireworks   21 2 2020  lake toya  gt  hakodate  hakodate station  senshu an  hakodate gokoku shrine  asaichi market  kanemori red brick warehouse  pastry snaffle s   petite merveille  goryokaku tower  lucky pierrot  mt hakodate ropewayfinal full day in hokkaido  as soon as we arrived in hakodate  we left our luggage with our hotel  la jolie motomachi  if you ever ride the hakodate streetcar  make sure you grab a ticket when you board or you scan your ic card  my partner and i forgot to do this and nearly realized too late  luckily  i was able to converse with some women next to us and we were able to all pay together  senshu an had some delicious japanese pastries  but it was maybe 4 or 5 blocks away from the streetcar   worth it if you plan on going to the gokoku shrine or if you like walking  but i m sure there are more pastry shops in central hakodate if that s where you ll be sticking around  the view of hokkaido and the ocean from gokoku shrine was beautiful  so it s worth a visit  asaichi market seemed more expensive than sapporo s market but more open and weing  with more vendors selling a larger variety of goods  the kanemori red brick warehouse is a great place to go if you re looking for some souvenirs from hokkaido hakodate  it s a series of small shops inside an old warehouse with plenty of variety  this is where you can find pastry snaffle s and petite merveille  which have some great sweet  cheese omelette  but if you only have the time to visit one of them  go for petite merveille   they also have hokkaido milk and kabocha soft serve and some good milk pudding  goryokaku isn t much fun to walk around in the winter  but it s a beautiful sight from atop the tower  the star shaped illumination looks great  we ate at the lucky pierrot across from the tower  and though the burger was good  i wasn t too much of a fan of the chinese chicken one  the egg one was much better  in my opinion  the chinese chicken one tasted too salty for a burger  i think  last stop for the night was to ride the ropeway to the top of mt hakodate  which was a great view of the whole of hakodate   22 2 2020  hakodate  gt  hkd  gt  tpe  gt  sfo we took the airport shuttle bus from hakodate station to hkd this morning after breakfast  no reservation needed  just hop on the bus with 450 yen  it departs every 20 minutes ,1

trying to travel from tokyo to kyoto,i m going to be traveling to japan in the near future  i m trying to get to kawazu from tokyo and having difficulty understanding what i need to do before hand  what i need to do there  and when all things need to happen  i have a jr exchange for a pass the details unfortunately my flight lands in the late evening after all reserved seat reservations are closed  can i do this online before hand  can t seem to find where i do this for odoriko it seems like the odoriko train is the best option  but requires an additional purchase  is there anyway to get there with a jr pass  where when do i have to get tickets lastly  trying to get from kawazu to kyoto  is there a  best way  to do this  it seems like heading back up to tokyo and then taking the bullet train but thought it d be good to ask here to pick brains of people who have done this or similar more than me all in all thanks for the time info in advance,1
day trips from kinosaki onsen ,hey japan travellers my bf and i are planning a 5 week trip around japan from late march to april  we have booked 3 nights at kinosaki onsen and are thinking about doing a day trip from there during our stay i was initially thinking of takeda castle but there isn t much info about it so am open to other suggestions  we will only be using public transport  would love to hear your thoughts about this area thank you ,1
how much did you spend on food in japan  what was your favorite what was most worth it ,my husband and i are planning 9 days across kyoto  nara  and tokyo  a big part of our plan is eating   we ve already decided that we ll stop for any street food or vending machine items that look interesting  on top of planning to eat lunch and dinner  our hotel provides breakfast  we don t have a set budget  but from what i can see we can expect about 1500 yen for meals and 200 500 yen for snacks  i m firmly in the camp that money spent on japanese food is money well spent  which is why i m relaxed about our food budget  we re most excited to try wagyu beef  truly fresh sushi  we live in a landlocked state  so this will be mind blowing i m sure  anpan  dumplings  and onigiri  how much did you spend  what did you eat  what was most worth it not worth it ,1

plans for august in hokkaido   advice needed,hello japantravel  my friend and i are planning on spending about 3 weeks in japan this summer   two weeks attending the olympics  and six days outside of tokyo  we are currently planning on hokkaido as our non tokyo destination  but we are having trouble settling on our hokkaido itinerary  i vee up with two potential strategies and i d love to hear whether you think it makes sense  or if i have some glaring oversights  we chose hokkaido because after spending two weeks in super packed tokyo  we are interested in seeing some nature and going off the beaten track as we imagine we are not the only people planning to travel around japan after the games also  obviously this will all change depending on the status of the coronavirus  as the games might be cancelled  pleaseent assuming the trip games will proceed as planned our limitations and priorities  we will not be leaving tokyo any earlier than 8 10 due to the games our aodations we must return to nrt in time for a 7 pm flight on saturday  8 15 20we would like to stay at a nice ryokan for my friend s birthday  8 11 itinerary 1  southern hokkaido shinkansen monday 8 10  shinkansen to hakodate  explore hakodate  red building markets  cable car up mt hakodate  walk around the city tuesday  8 11  pick up rental car  drive to hell valley and noboribetsu  see sights  go for a hike  stay in noboribetsu onsen wednesday  8 12  drive from noboribetsu to sapporo with a stop to hike in shikotsu toya  explore sapporo thursday  8 13  explore sapporo friday  8 14  drive from sapporo to hakodate with a stop in otaru  boat tour  stay in hakodate saturday  8 15  take first train from hakodate to tokyo  7 pm flight from narita itinerary 2  central hokkaido flight monday 8 10  fly early   tokyo  gt  sapporo  rent car in sapporo  drive to biei  blue pond  sunflower fields tuesday 8 11  drive biei to sounkyo onsen  relax  see some waterfalls or sunflowers on the way or afternoon hike wednesday 8 12  morning hike in daisetsuzan  drive back to sapporo  return car thursday 8 13  explore sapporo or maybe otaru if we do not return the car friday 8 14  more sapporo saturday 8 15  fly to tokyo  flight from nrt at 7 pmi would really like to take the shinkansen  but my qualm is just how long it takes to get from tokyo to sapporo   we would have to spend about 9 hours on the train each way  itinerary 1 tries to explore the option of arriving in hakodate to reduce our time on the train  but hakodate itself is fairly far away from a lot of the really cool stuff  is our limited time too precious to make spending that long on the train worth it  making option 2 more preferable  is there another destination we might want to explore instead thank you in advance ,1

tokyo 1 week trip report ,hello  my brother and i just got back from a one week trip from tokyo  so i wanted to share what we did  this sub was very helpful for planning things to do  so thanks everyone amp x200b day 1  arrive in tokyo  shinjuku  arrived at narita airport  exchanged currency  picked up pocket wifi  jr passes  and suica cards  and took narita express to shinjuku station  walked to hotel and dropped stuff off  then walked around the surrounding area  stopped by the nearby mcdonald s to get a quick bite  got some bread at a nearby bakery  then bought some water and snacks from a 7 eleven before returning to the hotel to sleep day 2  shinjuku  shibuya  asakusa  went to don quijote shinjuku kabukicho  walked to a starbucks to chill and plan the rest of the day  took the subway to meiji jingu and explored  then walked around the surrounding area  this was one of our favorite parts of the trip  it was really peaceful just exploring the neighborhoods here  we walked to yoyogi park  where we found some amazing cherry blossoms  checked out cat street and observed all the neat little shops in the area  went to shibuya crossing  hachiko statue  shopped in tokyu hands in shibuya  note  this and another tokyu hands were the only places the whole trip where we found face masks  all the other stores where we expected to find some didn t have any  got some dessert  shopped at onitsuka tiger  took train back to hotel  got some amazing ramen at menya musashi shinjuku sohonten  per a rendation on reddit  checked out the views from tokyo metropolitan government building observatory  took the subway to sensoji temple  then went back home  note  we originally were planning on seeing the temple later in the trip  but we had nothing planned for the rest of the night and decided to yolo it here  probably wasn t the best decision in hindsight given that my brother had a stomach ache later in the night day 3  odaiba  got some breakfast from the next door familymart  teamlab borderless  took a chill walk nearby odaiba beach  there was some construction going on  so we weren t able to go on the beach itself  we found a ton of cherry blossoms along the road  which was a nice surprise  found a bench outside with a nice view of the olympic rings and rainbow bridge  and chilled here for a while  checked out aqua city odaiba  i got some food downstairs in the food court  teamlab planets  i enjoyed this one much more than borderless  took the subway back to the hotel  shopped a little in takashimaya times square day 4  meguro  daikanyama  checked out shinjuku gyoen national garden  we found some beautiful cherry blossoms here as well  of course  there weren t nearly as many as the spring time  took the subway to meguro city and walked to naka meguro park  registered for bike share and took some bikes down to factory  amp  labo kanno coffee  the coffee was very good  rode bikes down to meguro parasitological museum  very unique and interesting museum  definitely one of a kind  rode bikes up to daikanyama t site and checked out some clothing stores around the area  took the subway back to the hotel  then got some sushi at a nearby conveyor belt sushi restaurant called rotating sushi oedo shinjuku nishiguchi  per a reddit rendation  it was absolutely amazing despite the low cost  we walked through the  weird  part of shinjuku  it was very interesting  note  biking around on this day was perhaps my favorite part of the entire trip  there was something about exploring the areas on bicycle that was just different than walking  it was a truly magical feeling  and i highly rend anyone try it at least once if theye to japan day 5  ueno  akihabara  we biked to ueno park along the kanda river  we biked around shinobazu pond  north of the pond was the most traditional looking neighborhood i saw on the whole trip  the contrast was pretty wildpared to other parts of tokyo we saw  we walked to the front of ueno zoo and enjoyed some street snacks to the left of the entrance  along the path up to shinobazunoike bentendo temple  we were going to go to the zoo but decided against it  and instead walked straight to tokyo national museum  first chilling on a bench nearby it  there was some festival type of thing going on  i m not sure if it s like that every day  but it was nice  we explored the museum  then took the subway just north of akihabara  then walked south toward akihabara  along the way we came across a line of shops underneath a subway line  we got some coffee and shopped around a little  it was a nice discovery  i would rend checking it out if you re in the akihabara area  i got a hat at this hat shop there    we walked around akihabara  the main street was closed off  so people were walking right on the street  the energy there was great  we checked out a sega arcade and walked all the way up to the top floor  each floor was full of surprises  on the bottom floor  we both spent way too much money trying to get a kirby  squirtle  and charmander plushies  i swear those cranes are rigged the fifth floor consisted of music related video games  the people there were so good at the games  it was unreal  we took the subway back to the hotel and got some really good tonkatsu nearby  they offered unlimited miso soup and rice  which was a nice touch  i m not sure if this is typical or not    we shopped around a little bit nearby then called it a day day 6  kinugawa onsen  we rode bikes around the northern part of shinjuku  then got lunch at ichiran ramen  the ramen was great  we took the train to kinugawa onsen  there were a lot of mishaps here  including some missed transfers  it was bad  but we made it eventually  we stayed at kinugawa onsen hotel  this was our first experience at an onsen  and we enjoyed it a lot  the breakfast and dinner were both buffet style  and they were good as well day 7  nikko  tokyo  we went to the onsen in the morning  this time  it was at the other location  the hotel swaps the two for men and women each morning  we left the hotel and headed for nikko  we dropped off our luggage at the coin lockers in nikko station  then checked out the temples  we took the train to tokyo  things went much more smoothly this time around  we checked in to a hotel nearby tokyo station  then went to the nearby pokemon center  we walked to yurakucho and got some beer and sashimi at andy s shin hinomoto  it was amazing  we walked to the nearby bic camera  and looked around  then went back to the hotel day 8  tokyo station  we walked to tokyo station  preparing to head to the airport  we walked along tokyo character street  got some crepes  and walked outside on marunouchi plaza  there was a cool countdown timer for the tokyo 2020 olympics  we got lunch at the marunouchi building  then went back to tokyo station and took the narita express to narita airport amp x200b overall  this was an amazing trip despite the coronavirus scares  i hope to return sometime in the future to see the other parts of japan like kyoto  osaka  nara  hiroshima  etc  thank you to everyone who posted on this sub offering helpful pointers  places to see  etc  it was incredibly helpful ,1

2 5 week trip report  kyoto  tokyo  kamakura  nara   osaka,this sub was super helpful in planning this trip to japan  so thanks to everyone   whoented with advice and tips  even with the covid 19 virus anxiety our trip was fantastic and japan lived up to all my magical expectations  my partner and i had so much fun and were lucky enough to meet up with some friends also visiting in japan  this will be a long book like post  but i loved reading trip reports before mine   so i wanted to post my own     ps  sorry for any formatting errors  i wrote this on mobile and probably didn t spend enough time editing it   some stuff to note 1  neither of us have been to japan before 2  my partner and i are very into anime manga otaku so this trip was heavy on that 3  many people told us to spend less time in osaka but i am glad i didn t listen  it was honestly one of my favourite places  i preferred it to tokyo  4  i m vegetarian and my partner doesn t eat beef5  my trip was from feb 4 2020   feb 20th 2020 trip report schedule   tokyo 1 night   kyoto 3 days  tokyo 6 days  kamakura  5 day  osaka 5 days  nara  5 day kyoto  our journey got off to a very rocky start  it started snowing in vancouver the morning we were to fly out  by our 1pm departure time there was significant delays  we ended up being delayed by 2 hours  now the way the booking worked out we were supposed to fly to narita and then catch a connecting flight to osaka  booking requirement for the cheap rate we got  from there we planned to just train right to kyoto instead as we wanted to finish in osaka where we were flying out of  anyway as you imagined we missed our connecting flight  the airline gave us pre paid visa s to catch a shinkansen instead  unfortunately we landed at 7 15pm  and the last train to get to the bullet train from the airport and to kyoto was at 7 50pm  by the time we got through customs picked up our pocket wifi and figured out what to do with the trains we were too late  we ended up having to grab a hostel and spent the night in tokyo  which wasn t ideal but turned out fine       kyoto day 1  with our jet lag kicking in we got ourselves checked out and over to tokyo station by 7am  grabbed some bento s   i was very happy to find a vegan one  during the ride we ended up getting a pretty nice view of mount fiji which was a treat  our airbnb was a 20 min walk from nishiki market so we wandered down there  on the way we stopped off at engine ramen for our first bowl of ramen of the trip  we continued through nishiki market  exploring trinket shops  the smell of many different kinds of food  gachapons and even an animate store i wasn t expecting to find  there was also a very cute shrine nestled in among the shops  after a couple hours here we walked over to where the kyoto pokemon center was and i lost my mind at the adorable kimono pikachu statue  sooo cute  afterwards we walked around this shopping area a bit  exploring a book store with tons of studio ghibli art books and other illustration type books  stopping into a nana s green tea for a matcha parfait before heading back to the airbnb  we grabbed some snacks and beer from the nearby lawsons and passed out by 7pm from that good ole  jet lag       kyoto day 2  we got up super early again and made our way up to fushimi inari  we arrived around 7am just after the sun started to rise  it waspletely empty apart from a small handful of joggers and one or two other tourists  it felt so magical to have the placepletely to ourselves  we took our time walking up stopping for lots of crowd free photos  deff take peoples advice ande early by the time we headed out around 9 it was getting busy  on our way back  i bought an fox ema charm from a lady who informed me she designed it herself  we took the back way down which was charming in itself  tons of these little shrines all over  and funnily enough vending machines  having a hot can of coffee in the chilly winter air was amazing  we walked through the little food street off the main path on our way out and got some green tea daifuku mochi and takoyaki  then  made our way over to the gekkeikan okura sake museum which was smaller then i expected  it was alright and we got a small bottle of sake for free each  but i probably wouldn t do it again  after this we went to the gion area  we got some freshly made udon soup and tempura at a small shop that had a vegan friendly option  it was amazing  freshest softest noodles i have ever had  just wandered around this area  went into the tatami mat starbucks which was very cool  the ghibli store which was one of the largest i saw on this entire trip  and visited yasaka shrine  getting a bit sleepy we stopped at kyoto station on our way back to the airbnb and watched the valentines light show they had playing on the massive staircase and walked through the illuminated sky walkway       kyoto day 3  last day in kyoto  we grabbed some steamed buns and coffee from the lawsons and made our way to the kyoto manga museum  we got our portraits drawn manga style by a local artists and it s one of my favourite souvenirs of the trip  the museum was very neat and even had a small section on the main floor with manga s in different languages including an english one  once finished we headed out to tokyo imperial palace  while this was very neat and the grounds were beautiful i think i could have skipped this one and still been happy lol  we then made our back back to nishiki market  grabbed a bowl of vegan ramen at ippudo   note this location is the only one in japan with the vegan ramen  after eating we went back into some shops we saw on day 1  including aritsugu knife shop where we purchased a santoku knife to bring home  we hit up a few arcades as well before heading home to pack up for our move to tokyo     tokyo    t okyo day 1  we took the shinkansen from kyoto to tokyo at 9 30am eating some breakfast on the train  once in tokyo we checked into our airbnb had a couple beers in our room and then went out to shinjuku  we honestly didn t do much here as i got spooked by a weird encounter with a drunk man  we walked around a bit and had some tempura bowls from a restaurant before making our way over to our reservations at the monster hunter bar which i fully rend  the food is alright as you expect at a character cafe bar but the theming was incredible and its really neat to be able to play the game on the big tv  i was surprised to find  we were the only white tourists in the bar and there was quite a few locals having dates       tokyo day 2  we made our way over to yoyogi park and meiji shrine around 9am  i really loved this park and shrine they were beautiful and we were lucky that there was not to many tourists  then we hit up harajuku  got some crepes looked in some shops and then went to the sailor moon store  i was honestly super disappointed in how little they had in stock  we got some beer and gyoza after and then found a kiddyland  one regret i have is not spending more time here going into more of the interesting shops  from here we decided to go out to gotokuji temple  it is a bit of a walk from the train station but it was a very cute neighbourhood  the temple and grounds itself was honestly super nice  and we spent more time walking around here then i expected us to  we then went out to shiro higes cream puff factory for totoro cream puffs which were unbelievably delicious  and then finished up the day in shibuya  we made sure to hit up the new nintendo store while there and it was filled with way to many things i wanted to buy  the new pokemon center here was also quite good for shopping       tokyo day day 3  ghibli museum day  possibly my favourite part of the entire trip as i am a massive ghibli fan and have a full arm sleeve tattoo dedicated to the films  we took the museum themed bus from mitaka station at 9 40am to the museum  i can t even describe how amazing and intricate and well thought out this place is  so many beautiful little details all over  i took my time exploring every corner of the museum  spending around 5 hours here in total  we watched the short film  had lunch at the cafe and then spent 45 min going through the gift shop which had plenty of exclusive goods  i got a pink totoro keychain and black chibi totoro plush which i have never seen anywhere else  we grabbed some bottles of the museum brewed craft beer and looked over the park beside the building for a bit  once my partner was finally able to convince me to leave my happiest place on earth we went out to shop at nakano broadway  and tokyo character street and station  i highly rend t s tantan in tokyo station for any veggies in japan  the sesame ramen is unreal      tokyo day 4  this day we headed out to teamlabs boarderless near odaiba  we arrived for 10 30am and it was a weekday so we didn t experience any issues getting inside  had to queue for maybe 5 min for a couple popular rooms  such as the floating nest and the lamps but otherwise i was pleasantly surprised  i was expecting more people i do think the coronavirus and lack of chinese tourists contributed to our low crowds through out this trip though  i would rend this for another trip  it was a very unique experience  it took us about 2ish hours to go through and then we decided to find some food in odaiba and see the unicorn gundum and check out venus fort shopping mall  venus fort is really cool  the interior design is amazing and it even had this section that was built to look like the 30 s  50 s era s with old school cars  has a great ghibli store as well heh  then we went back into the city to head to the pokemon dx store   tokyo skytree  we didn t go up skytree as it was pretty expensive but the area around it has tons of shops and restaurants       tokyo day 5  kamakura day trip  we took the shinkansen straight from tokyo to kamakura early in the morning  arriving in kamakura around 9am  it was a bit rainy the first hour we were there so we grabbed a latte in a small local shop and then went to a happy pancake for breakfast  japanese pancakes are unreal  i still cant get over how fluffy they are  we walked along komachi street up to tsurugaoka hachiman gu temple where we got to watch a traditional japanese wedding take place by pure luck  definitely a trip highlight  then we walked up the hill to walk to hokokuji temple   bamboo forest and had ceremonial matcha in the little tea house overlooking the bamboo forest for only 900 yen per person  it was really quite lovely and if you go out to kamakura i suggest you do this  from here we headed back into tokyo  though i still regret not stopping into the ghibli shop before leaving  amp amp amp amp gt amp amp amp amp lt    once back in tokyo we went to afuri for some amazing ramen and then to tokyo tower  we were feeling pretty beat so grabbed snacks and beers and hung out at our airbnb the rest of the evening      tokyo day 6  we were feeling pretty beat this day so it ended up being pretty light  we went to ueno park and ate some pastries we got from a nearby bakery for breakfast on a bench  we considered going to the zoo  but it looked kinda sad and the reviews turned us off  so instead we headed over to akihabara where we spent the vast majority of our day looking at anime figures and merch  we got the cute magikarp taiyaki and went for ramen at kyushu jangara ramen  closer to evening time we made our way to asakusa and senso ji shrine  i was sad that we didn t quite make it there before 6 so most of the shopping in the street leading up to the shrine was closed  but there was a few open still  we ended up finding a cute pizza place in this area for dinner and had some extremely tasty pizza s while a lady at the nearby table fed her dogs from her plate haha  japan is strangely dog friendly and i loved it   osaka   osaka day 1  met up with our friends from vancouver and took the shinkensan around 10am to osaka  once we got checked into our respective airbnb s we met back up for dinner at mumokuteki in the umeda area  this cafe is attached to a shop and super tasty vegan food  my partner and i had the spicy dandan noodle soup  post dinner we walked through umeda area  found grand front osaka which is  gigantic shopping mall  there was a japanese band playing a live set with a bumpin crowd outside  i hit up the ghibli store in here and then we checked out umeda sky building  the view from here at night is really worthwhile     osaka day 2   nara  went out to nara first thing in the morning with our friends  we walked up to the park from the station and there was a ton of cute shops  got some fresh made dango fed a ton of deer and saw todaiji temple which definitely lived up to the hype  we also got some udon from a small shop 15 min walk north of park entrance  they had 2 vegan options  once back in osaka around 3pm we got some dinner at a ramen shop near dotonbori and wandered into shinsaibashi suji shopping street  we came across a disney store here that had a very exclusive line of winnie the pooh sakura plushies only sold at that location       osaka day 3   we got breakfast at eggs  n  things near amerikamura and then walked through denden town before getting to invasion club  tattoo shop  pretty much here for 13 hours  it was a long grinding day but my tattoo turned out incredible  if you are in osaka and collect tattoos i highly rend checking out invasion club and hori benny  he s got wicked talent for your otaku   anime tattoos  we got back to the airbnb at 3am and ate some quick meals from 711      osaka day 4  a slower day as i got a 10 hour long tattoo on my calf the night before  we had reservations for the pokemon cafe which was honestly super cute  the food was much better then i thought  i had the eevee parfait and my partner got the morpeku curry  shopping at the pokemon center next door after and then we went out to the osaka aquarium  this aquarium is amazing  the main tank spans down 3 4 floors and is just massive harbouring a whale shark  tons or rays and fish etc  we went a couple hours before close and it was basically empty  a lot of the animals were sleeping but there was something really nice about watching the penguins sleep  we got yet another bowl of ramen on the way back to the airbnb       osaka day 5  on our last day we went for fluffy souffle pancakes at happy pancake  you need to go here  they are so good  i think about them everyday  after we went to a hedgehog cafe  i was really on the fence on this one as i don t like supporting these types of things but we did some research and picked one with really high reviews and ethical treatment  it was not busy  there was 2 other couples in when we went  people were extremely quiet with the hedgehogs and mostly just held them while they slept  since they are nocturnal i thought this was really great handling  we spent 30 min just cuddling ours while he slept in our hands lap and feeding him a few treats  i suggest avoiding 90  of places like this though and really really do your research if you want to go  the rest of the day was last minute shopping around namba and dotonburi and then we grabbed some gyoza and beers for our last meal ,1

has anyone ever traveled to echizen in fukui prefecture  i have a few questions ,hi all i will be traveling to early april 2020 and had planned ti visit echizen  i m very interested in the japanese countryside and thought echizen would be a good day trip from kyoto since its pretty close my main concern is regarding bicycles  i plan to ride around the city via bike  but after searching for a rental shop in the center of the city there was nothing  has anyone ever traveled to echizen and rented a bike  if not a bike  what form of transportation did you use i did search google already and found one bike shop  but  it was pretty far from downtown echizen and a good half hour bus ride to get there  any advice would be appreciated thanks for reading ,1
itinerary check   tokyo  early april    solo trip,hello fellow japan travelers  i have fallen in love with japan and will be embarking on my  third  trip thising april i have previously been to tokyo  kyoto  nara  osaka  kobe  hiroshima  and miyajima with friends and will be returning to tokyo as a solo traveler to revisit favorite spots and experience new things that i missed on previous trips amp nbsp this is a short trip and i will only be staying in tokyo for 4 nights and will be staying in  ginza  i really enjoy sushi  beef   soba  and  yakitori  and have carefully researched and planned the food for the trip secured reservations through my hotel s concierge  i do worry that i ve over planned a a bit   in terms of activities  i ve been stunned by the cherry blossoms last year  yodobashi akiba   vr in  akihabara  the  kappabashi  neighborhood  and  teamlab planets amp nbsp what i do need help with is filling in my days and need some solo travel advice relating to specific activities amp nbsp day 1  land at 4 25pm  head to my hotel in  ginza  walk to  ginza kagari  for  tori paitan  ramen for dinner and possibly grab some sushi at a standing sushi bar  uogashi  or  okame  finally  hit up a  lawson  for some fried chicken and call it a night amp nbsp day 2  wake up  hopefully at a normal time  and eat a small breakfast  walk around  ginza  and arrive at  arai  at noon for my first omakase sushi lunch to set the tone for the trip  have a free afternoon  would love advice  before heading to  yonekyu  for dinner  i was turned on to yonekyu by  mark wiens  a prominent food vlogger  i ve never had  sukiyaki  before and have been told that having this cuisine in japan is very unique  on my last trip  we went to  yoroniku  for  yakiniku   korean bbq  and had delicious cuts of beef  no real plans for the evening but hopefully my jetlag won t be too bad and i will be able to visit  star bar  or  bar hoshi  for a drink  on my last trip  i really enjoyed the whimsical drinks and engaging bartenders at  bar orchard  as well as the master bartender at  mori bar amp nbsp day 3  activity day  wake up early and arrive at  teamlab borderless  at 9 15am  pray that they open the doors open before the 10am opening time and enjoy a few hours in the museum  grab a quick lunch of  onigiri  and fried chicken at the  lawson  in odaiba before walking over to  oedo onsen monogatari  to take a dip in the hot pools to relax  i have never been to an  onsen  and while i know this is not a true replacement  it seems like it will be a lot of fun  my plan was to go from the theme park to  streetkart shinagawa aka maricar  they have a 6pm  3 hour tour that travels from  shinagawa  to  rainbow bridge  to  tokyo tower  to  shibuya crossing what do people think about this day  is it too packed  would teamlab borderless be fun as a solo traveler  i know people seem to have varying opinions on maricar  what does everyone think  should i do it solo or wait to do it with friends amp nbsp day 4  no plans in the morning  head to  tempura kondo  to experience a 2 michelin starred  tempura  restaurant  i ve heard that the sweet potato and carrot are excellent and that the batter is thin and not greasy  although  tempura  is not one of my favorite types of food  it seems that this restaurant is unique and worth a visit  spend the afternoon walking around the  kagurazaka  neighborhood and have a cold soba afternoon snack and michelin starred  kyourakutei  spend the evening eating  yakitori  at  eiki  in ebisu and then circle back to star bar or bar hoshi  whichever i didn t get to earlier in the trip amp nbsp day 5  final day in tokyo   enjoy a final breakfast at the hyatt centric before enjoying a final sushi meal at  iwa 815  with chef  hisayoshi iwa  take the train to haneda  arriving around 3pm  and fly home amp nbsp as you can see  i have a fairly well planned out trip  focused on food  though  i want to make sure that i experience the city and have places to walk around check out in between meals  please let me know your suggestions rendations  i am grateful for this subreddit and your input  thanks ,1

itinerary check  late march   early april ,hi everyone i posted our preliminary itinerary a few months ago  but a lot has changed since then  with around a month left  i think our plan is done ish  but i would like to hear your advice and suggestions  i m going with my bf and japan  especially during the sakura season  has always been our dream trip  we re going to be there from march 29th until april 11th we have never been to japan and are absolutely overwhelmed by the possible destinations and activities  however  we have managed to put together an itinerary of all the cool stuff to see in japan that we feel are only in japan but also just beautiful and interesting  we want to see the bustling cities and high tech metropolitan environments  we want to experience the legendary train rides thru nature  we want to hike  we want onsens and castles and food   so much food notes  we are buying the jr pass and have bought japan wireless sim cards  they should work with our eu phones  right  besides this fujikawaguchiko private onsen experience  we would like to go to a public one as well  i think our best bets are either hakone or nikko or perhaps the onsen on mt  takao  any suggestions  on our last day in kyoto we are planning to send our suitcases back to tokyo and backpack through hakone  fujikawaguchiko and mt  takao  i found this  yamato transport  website and it seems that lots of people use it  anything we should be aware of  we want to try as much japanese food as possible  we have three fancy dinners planned and reserved  but the rest of it we plan to do on the go  we are looking for rendations for everything japanese  especially ramen  we would also to go to one of the weird restaurants  probably not the robot one or the maid butler ones  is kawaii monster cafe worth it  or ninja one  we still can t decide   days  march 29   april 11 itinerary day 1   tokyo  sun arrival at nrt at around 10am  we expect to be jet lagged and exhausted from the 14 hour flight so we planned this day to be a light one  leaving our suitcases in the hotel and going to shinjuku  national gyoen  hanazono shrine  metropolitan government building  maybe samurai museum and then dinner and a night out probably somewhere in omoide yokocho   day 2   tokyo  mon tsukiji market first thing in the morning  we have a reservation for teamlab planets at 11 30 so any suggestions what to do in the meantime are very wee  after teamlab we are visiting shibuya for a light lunch  seeing the crossing and hachiko and then going to the meiji shrine in the afternoon  probably visiting one of the animal caf s nearby  harry harajuku terrace is our choice so far  but we are open to suggestions as well  anyways  afternoon in shibuya and then we re going to seirinkan for the famous pizza  after dinner probably back to shibuya so we can experience it at nighttime   day 3   tokyo  tue doing the whole tokyo imperial tour  edo castle  east gardens  hibiya park  kokyogaien  kitanomaru koen and chidorigafuchi green way to see the blossoms  our afternoon is mostly empty so we might do some shopping or just roam around the streets of tokyo  our dinner reservation is in akasaka so we might go a little earlier to visit toyokawa inari shrine  anything else nearby we shouldn t miss  we were planning to visit state guest house  but by then it will be closed   day 4   nikko  wed activating our jr passes and spending a whole day in nikko  going to the akeichidara ropeway first and seeing the chuzenji lake and temple  then kegon falls  then going back to the town area for lunch and seeing the whole shrine area  we would like to see shinkyo bridge  rinnoji temple  toshogu shrine  futarasan jinja and kanmangafuchi abyss  the rest of it is pretty much optional  then we will probably have enough time to hop into an onsen  if we decide to do it here  i m not quite sure about this itinerary and what the best course of action is  considering the working hours of ropeway and most of the shrines   day 5   kyoto  thu leaving our tokyo hotel and going to kyoto by shinkansen  we probably allocated way too little time for this city  but figured it out too late  when we d already booked our hotels  so we plan to see the best of  kiyomizu dera  kinkaku ji  philosopher s path and silver pavillion  probably kyoto imperial palace if we have time and the national museum  maybe do some shopping in sanneizaka and nineizaka and then dinner and evening in gion and just hang around kamo river  we re not sure what the best way to do this is  or if it s even possible so we would really appreciate any advice   day 6   himeji osaka  fri catching the first shinkansen to himeji  visiting the castle and the garden  3 hrs give or take  after himeji we re catching the 12pm train to osaka  first thing is lunch  we found a few good places around shin osaka station but suggestions are wee  then we re visiting osaka castle  2 hrs  and going to osaka aquarium  2 3 hrs  after that we are either spending the evening in osaka  dotonbori or something  and then catcing a train back to kyoto or going back to kyoto right away and spending the evening there day 7   arashiyama nara  sat first thing in the morning we re going to the arashiyama bamboo forest and the monkey park  then we re catching a train to nara and hope to be there by 12 12 30  visiting the kofuku ji and todai ji temple  nara park  isui en garden if we have time and the national museum  kasuga taisha is optional  if we have time and will  going back to kyoto and spending an evening there  maybe seeing something that is still open  anything except fushimi inari that s really worth it  or again just hanging around  eating nice food and experiencing the city   day 8   hakone  sun  leaving the kyoto hotel and catching a shinkansen to odawara  buying a hakone pass  or should we go for the hakone fuji one  i read on japan guide that hakone fuji pass doesn t pay off unless we re going to use the buses in kawaguchiko  but i m not sure  spending a day in hakone  ropeway  sightseeing ship  just enjoying the nature  maybe onsen before or after the dinner   day 9   fuji five lakes  mon leaving our hakone hotel in the morning and catching a bus for gotemba and then the one for kawaguchiko  since it s our anniversary day  we don t have much planned for this day as we want it to be as relaxing and romantic as possible  we want to stroll by the lake  maybe visit chureito pagoda if it s possible  we might also go to fuji q highland for a few rides  anything else near lake kawaguchiko we should see  i found plenty of stuff around other lakes  but we don t want to spend this day riding a bus or something  also  we have to be back in our hotel at 17 00 because we have a dinner which we paid quite a lot for  our room here has a private open bath with a mt  fuji view so we re probably spending the evening there  or doing another stroll around the town   day 10   mt  takao tokyo  tue going back in tokyo direction but stopping to hike mt  takao  is the onsen here worth it  going to our hotel in ueno  spending the evening in akihabara   day 11   tokyo  wed this whole day is basically disney sea  we have never been to a disney park and we really want to make the best of it so we re looking for any tips and tricks day 12   tokyo  thu ueno day basically  zoo is a must and regarding museums  national museum of western art and tokyo national museum are our top picks  we might visit some of the other ones if we have time  we plan to go to the ghibli store at skytree  maybe some other shops  but we probably won t climb the skytree  unless there isn t that much crowd  we have a dinner reservation in ginza and after that we re going to asakusa to see senso ji  asakusa shrine and kaminarimon  anything else to do in asakusa day 13   tokyo  fri a day where we have no real idea what to do  this is basically our wildcard day  visiting anything we didn t have enough time for earlier  edo tokyo museum is probably going to make this list  maybe some airbnb experiences or just getting lost around tokyo  definitely doing some shopping for souvenirs  fashion etc day 14   tokyo nrt  sat an early morning train ride from central tokyo to catch our 9am flight ,1

tried to book for a bunny cafe over the phone andpletely failed  what should i do now ,there s a cafe in tokyo called moff rell that my gf would absolutely love to visit as it s dedicated to bunnies  i looked up their  website  and couldn t find any way to book online  they only have a phone number  i ve never done an overseas call to someone who i haven t already been in contact with in other ways  but summed up a bit of courage and made the call  the website has an english section  so i thought i would be okay and be able to get someone who could speak at least enough english to make the booking  unfortunately the person who answered had almost no english at all  i tried to explain that i wanted to book but the only english i could make out was  no over phone  i panicked and said  nan de  to try and ask how but they immediately launched into a long string of japanese that i couldn t follow  i said i didn t understand and apologised in japanese and very sheepishly hung up the phone  as i don t know the correct way to end a phone conversation with someone i don t know  i feel flustered now and don t know what to do  should i just risk showing up to tokyo and hoping i ll be able to get in  is there a way to make these kind of phone bookings when i don t know enough japanese to understand what they re saying ,1
nikko   day trip from tokyo,i would like to ask what are the best places to check in nikko on our limited time there  we plan on getting there from tokyo around 8 30   9 30 am and leaving at 4 30   5 30 pm  sunday 29 3  the templeplex  toshogu  etc  is a must what route would you rend after visiting the temples  take the bus to kegon falls or something else  details would be appreciated also i would like to ask what would be the best route to transfer from ikebukuro station to nikko  we are activating our jr pass at this date   route 1  is to use shinkansen to get to utsunomiya and then a jr train  hyperdia suggests we get many transfers through this route  ikebukuro  gt  akabane  gt  omiya saitama   gt  utsunomiya  gt  nikko  which seems scary for travellers   route 2  is to use the express from  shibuya   shinjuku station to tobu nikko which much simpler  but costs extra even with the jr pass  i would like to know the extra cost to this route if it s possible  i already know that a round trip costs around 4000 yen without jr pass thank you,1
last minute itinerary check  march 15 march 28  kyoto osaka nara tokyo,hello  i am planning on traveling to japan with a friend during the first half of the cherry blossom season  it will be my first time going but my friend has been to japan once before  we both understand can speak japanese at a rudimentary level as we studied it in school so i m not too concerned about the language barrier  i m mainly writing this post to ask for some advice in hotel selection and general feedback on our plans  thanks in advance   itinerary overview   3 15 3 19 staying in kyoto  03 15  arrive in tokyo   shinkansen to kyoto  gt  check into hotel  gt  explore area recover from jet lag  03 16  spend day in northern kyoto  arashiyama  kinkaku ji  imperial palace  hirano shrine  03 17  spend day in eastern kyoto  fushimi inari  daigoji temple  ginkaku ji  philosopher s path  03 18  day trip to osaka    in dotonbori for the most part  maybe osaka castle  03 19  day trip to nara  todai ji  nara koen    wakakusayama   3 20 one night stay in ryokan in hakone  03 20  travel to hakone  morning will likely be spent in kyoto if we still have things we want to do   3 21 3 28 staying in tokyo  03 21  travel to tokyo  morning will likely be spent in hakone  03 22  animejapan  if the event doesn t get canceled  tokyo bigsight  03 23 25  flexible  lots of cherry blossom viewing  shinjuku gyoen  ueno koen  megurogawa  etc  03 26  ghibli museum  03 27  flexible   03 28  flight home   the idea behind the planning of this trip is to go to kyoto the week before spring break for many schools in japan which starts on the 23rd  that way there hopefully will be less people in kyoto osaka nara while we are there  on the other hand  tokyo is always going to have a ton of people so i figured that if anything it will decrease as families travel out of town for vacation  i would spend more time in kyoto or osaka but unfortunately we want to go to animejapan and our vacation dates don t have much flexibility our plans for tokyo are still up in the air for the most part  this is partially due to us not being sure what events will be canceled and whether or not our friend can snag us some concert event tickets  etc  that being said we are definitely planning on going to most if not all of the big wards districts  shibuya  shinjuku  etc    need advice before i start  i will say that all of my reservations at the moment are refundable  mostly out of concern of the corona virus impacting our travel plans  so switching around should not be an issue  budget is also not that much of an issue as long as it s not crazy luxury  ideally  100 150 usd a night maximum  i have considered hostels but my friend is notfortable with them  partially due to concern over the corona virus  even though i know in japan they are very nice  i have also considered airbnb but i m not familiar enough with japan to know which areas types of housing would suit us best    1  kyoto hotel selectioncurrently we booked a simple 5 night stay at decent hotel a few blocks south of kyoto station  this was mainly for convenience sake since we plan on making several day trips and will likely stay out late at osaka  however  reading through this subreddit a lot of people rend staying in gion or kawaramachi area  neither my friend nor i are that into drinking barhopping so traditional  night life  doesn t really matter to us  that being said  especially for our stay in kyoto  i would probably prefer if our aodations were in a place where we could experience the culture more  that being said i took a look at ryokan options in the area and they were either expensive or really out of the way  in short  is it worth it to stay in gion or kawaramachi if we plan on day trips to osaka and nara  if so where would you rend we stay if we don t care much for drinking and would like a more rustic experience    2  tokyo hotel selectionfor our tokyo aodations  i currently have a refundable 7 day booking at both remm akihabara and hotel coco grand ueno shinobazu  initially i wanted to stay in ueno since it s the cherry blossom season and we don t care enough about night life to stay in shinjuku shibuya  however  some posts on the subreddit warn that ueno bes incredibly busy during this period because of the cherry blossoms so i booked the akihabara place as a back up  both locations are right next to a jr station so getting around should not be an issue  i chose to book just one hotel for our stay in tokyo because it is slightly cheaper and more convenient to do it this way  however  people on the subreddit have also suggested that hotels should be treated as an experience and staying at 2 or 3 different ones is more worthwhile  in short  7 day stay in akihabara vs 7 day stay in ueno vs mix multiple locations  any additional rendations for places to stay in tokyo are also wee  3  miscellaneous for connectivity we re planning on getting a jr sim card over a pocket wifi for convenience  i have a pixel 3a and my friend has an iphone xr so there should be no issues based on the jr pass calculator  we d be saving a bit of money getting a 7 day pass but we re opting for just using a suica card for convenience any other suggestions rendations are wee thanks again ,1

sumo ticket etiquette for buying box seats,looking to purchase tickets on the very first night of may s sumo tournament in tokyo   one of the two types of tickets we re interested in is box seating   the boxes are sold with 4 seats to them  however  they are apparently 4 very small seats and there s no division between you and the 2x2 in front of you   can we purchase all 4 seats to have additional space  or is that considered rude in japan  i searched google images and sometimes there are only two in a seat  but impossible to tell if that s due to a low demand night  whereas our last night in tokyo is the first night of the tournament and its apparently a really hot ticket ,1

itinerary check  sept 19th   27th ,hello all  my good friend and i are flying to japan on sept 18th and we re super excited  we re also a bit overwhelmed  so wanted to share the itinerary thus far to get thoughts ask a few questions 9 19   arrive at nrt   4 30 pm  check into hotel airbnb  thinking ginza or shinjuku area  and grab food  maybe explore a bit9 20   western tokyo  shinjuku  meiji shrine  shibuya  harajuku 9 21   maybe asakusa and or odaiba  still figuring out  or less structured  free day  maybe an onsen on this day9 22   kamakura day trip  amp  hiking  then back to tokyo for evening fun  harmonica alley or another fun nightlife situation 9 23   bullet train to kyoto in am  check into hotel airbnb  looking to stay near gion  leisurely day wondering around gion surrounding area  maybe time for an onsen here9 24   exploring eastern kyoto shrines  kiyomizudera  yasaka  etc  wandering around hagashiyama9 25   nara day trip  todaiji  isuien garden  nara park 9 26   osaka day trip  osaka castle  dontonbori  minami district 9 27   early am bullet train to tokyo  hanging out until heading to nrt for 5 pm flightwhat do y all think about days spent in each city and the basic ideas we have thus far  maybe we re trying to do too much  i also worry about only spending one full day in kyoto  maybe it s worth sacrificing time in nara or osaka for it  our  home base  while in that area is kyoto so we ll always loop back there in the evening  but still wondering about that also wondering if it s smarter to travel back to tokyo on the 26th because of the possibility of a typhoon slowing us down  don t want to risk missing our flight back home  any and all thoughts are appreciated  thanks   edit  sounds like maybe swapping osaka  amp  nara then heading back to tokyo after nara might be the best move to avoid traveling back the same day as our flight  ,1

i need some advice on booking accessible hotel rooms ,my mom and i are going on a 10 day trip to japan next month to visit some friends who homestayed with us back in my drum corps days  but she doesn t walk well anymore  she uses a walker around the house  and i m having trouble figuring out how to get our lodgings set up  i ve poked around a half dozen threads on the topic in this subreddit  and from those  the  accessible japan  and  japan accessible  websites  but i still have a few questions  we re flying into osaka  and my friend there  gave   us   a   few   hotel  rendations  but cross checking them with the accessible hotel websites turned up nothing  do these hotels just not have accessible rooms  i ve read that booking the accessible rooms usually requires contacting the hotel directly  but my mom has a pile of airline points she was hoping to use to pay for the lodgings  we usually do our bookings online  but is there a way for us to use them when calling the hotels directly  also  that friend in osaka offered to call and make the reservations for us  but i d rather not put any more work on them than i have to  so do hotels generally have english speaking desk staff on hand if i were to try and call them myself  my mother has a severe pet allergy  basically anything with fur or feathers  and we had a bad experience on our last trip  to washington state  where someone had their pet in the room before us  and even after the staff s cleaning routine  mom s eyes swelled up painfully  is travelling with pets aon occurrence in japan  is there a way for us to try and get a pet free room  that same trip to washington had us get  more than one  of our supposedly accessible rooms lacking things like grab bars near the toilet  or  roll in showers  that you could not  in fact  roll into  from my reading  i get the impression that truly roll in showers might just be nearly non existent over there  and we could grudgingly cope with that  but toilet grab bars are hard for my mother to do without  is there a way for us to be sure of specific amenities ,1

getting from yokohama to mt  fuji 5th station,hello    this subreddit was incredibly helpful figuring out about my passenger van idea  i am moving on to my next question  we will be traveling from our beautiful miura shi  to mt  fuji  i am hoping to get  clarification for the best way to get from yokohama to the 5th station  i m assuming we will need to get into yokohama for the best connections via train or bus we want to have the option of arriving at the 5th station sometime around noon of the day  as we ll be climbing to the 8th station and our group ranges from a 16  yo and 25 yo who will probably run up the mountain  and then some old farts who are going to walk up at our leisure i can see that we can take the train back up to shinkuju but it looks like there is a bus from yokohama to kawaguchiko station that is slightly faster and has many fewer transfers  thoughts on if this is indeed true  and if so  where i might find translated time tables any other ideas are most wee ,1

3 weeks  kyushu and tohoku  leaving in a month  is this a realistic itinerary   solo ,hi all i asked  previously  about my second trip to japan  and the main opinion was that i should see some of the places that tourists often overlook their first time around  i ve decided to check out parts of both kyushu and tohoku  since i haven t been to either region  i ll be going in the first 3 weeks of april  so i ve kept the sakura forecast and the weather in mind  and split them up as  1 week for tokyo  split between the start and end of trip  1 week for kyushu  1 week for tohoku  tokyo   3 nights  2 full days gt  day 1  arrival at haneda   half day gt  days 2 3  full days in tokyofly to kyushu  7 nights total    haneda to fukuoka airport gt  day 4   fukuoka   3 nights    half day   yatai food stalls gt  day 5  fukuoka   ohori park  seaside momochi start 14 day jr national pass gt  day 6  fukuoka   day trip to  nagasaki or kitakyushu   wisteria garden   gt  day 7   kagoshima   3 nights    arrival gt  day 8  kagoshima    senganen garden   shiroyama park  amp  observatory gt  day 9  kagoshima   day trip to  kirishima   gt  day 10  return to  fukuoka   1 night    half day   canal city hakata  shopping fly to tohoku  8 nights total     fukuoka to sendai airport gt  day 11   sendai   4 nights    arrival gt  day 12  sendai   asaichi  morning market  matsushima bay gt  day 13  sendai   day trip to  yamadera   godaido hall gt  day 14  sendai   day trip to  kitakami   tenshochi park gt  day 15   fukushima   2 nights    arrival gt  day 16  fukushima   lake inawashiro gt  day 17   nikko   2 nights    arrival gt  day 18  nikko   nikko national park gt  day 19   tokyo   2 nights    arrival gt  day 20  tokyo   full day   shopping  last night gt  day 21  tokyo   half day   return departure for my travel style  i m going solo  and i prefer having home base cities and doing day trips from them  vs spending a night in a new city everyday  i m a bit older now  and it just allows me some breathing room in case i m exhausted  or run into bad weather  get sick  etc  so i tried to keep that as 2 nights minimum per city   for the places i m visiting  i don t want to forget about tokyo entirely  because i think i only spent about 2 3 nights in my previous trip over 3 years ago and it was all so rushed  for kyushu  i debated about going all the way to miyazaki and then flying to aomori  via a tokyo flight connection  to see lake towada  but i think that would be too rushed  i want to give myself some breathing room  as i said above  wondering if i made the right call on this  i m thinking i can always add that into my itinerary if i evere back to see hokkaido for the jr pass  i didn t see a huge price difference by getting two passes for kyushu  5 days    217 cad  and east coast  5 days    229 cad  vs a 14 day national pass  563 cad  a difference of  117 cad gives me flexibility if i somehow screw up  or if my plans change part way  please let me know if my logic is flawed on this one  i plan on using my pasmo card for all other local transit travel i ve been looking at a ton of stuff  and it s all pretty overwhelming about how much there is to see  so any advice would be appreciated  thank you ,1

what are the best castles for non japanese speakers ,hi all  still in the  vague ideas that sound cool  stage of planning a trip that probably won t take place for a year  but we are tentatively aiming for a nov 2021 visit  my initial plan is to do somebo of a tokyo hakone kyoto saka trip over the course of 14  maybe up to 21 days if need be  this will most likely be a family trip of me and my twin sister  age 30  and our parents  mid to upper 50 s  but in moderately good health and capable of walking long distances  i ve had a request to include a visit to  a castle  courtesy of some striking rurouni kenshin imagery that played during an old toonami promo  considering our very tentative location plans  i m thinking our choices would be limited to himeji   saka  or nijo castle  however  we re a pretty historical minded family  we like to see and also learn about things in context so we re not left blithely going  yup  that sure is a castle  my first instinct is to lean toward  saka castle  since it includes a museum that miiiiiight have some english displays since it s one of the bigger tourist attractions  and according to viator  an hour long english tour exists  i ve heard himeji is gorgeous but practically empty on the inside  which is unappealing for my family  i ve heard good things about nijo  except for its location being kind of out of the way  but i also can t seem to dig up any  one and done  english tours since we re not looking for a package tour deal are these my best options  i could easily be convinced to check out another  more suitable castle  so long as there s a way for my english speaking family to learn more about the place ,1

sendai first  this was our third trip to japan  after doing the usual tokyo  kyoto  hiroshima and nagasaki trip the last two times  since we visited some cities and areas that get mentioned less here i thought i d share some stories here  i m gonna skip tokyo for that reason  part 1  sendai  aomori  and hakodate  will post the second part later  day 6 and 7  sendaitook the shinkansen up to sendai  reserved seats online before the trip and picked them up at narita on arrival  we stayed at the apa tpk sendai ekikita  the one closest to the station  you can actually walk to the hotel without leaving the station  which was a good thing  cause it was freezing  10 celcius feeling with the wind  the hotel is pretty new and had by far the biggest tv i ve ever seen in a hotel room  50  inches in what felt like a room barely double that size matsushima bay after dumping our baggage at the hotel we took the train to hon shiogama station and walked to the pier where the  basho boat  to through  matsushima bay  left  it was a bit difficult to find  even with google maps  turns out it was inside the ferry building we basically had the boat to ourselves  just us and a family from some other asian country  probably thailand  but we didn t recognize the language  the views of the islands are quite nice and we stayed outside on the deck even though we were freezing our asses off  in case you re wondering  i was wearing  heatteck shirt  fleece sweater  windproof winter jacket  snow boots and heattech socks  no cap or gloves yet  the islands all have names and sometimes certain shapes  the english audio guide tells you what is what matsushima itself is also nice but probably really touristy during spring and summer  we walked through some of the temples and shrines and onto one of the islands until the sun started going down and the cold got the better of us yamadera the next day we doubted between going to  zao onsen   seeing the snow monsters and  juhyo light up  or visiting  yamadera  we chose the latter and i m glad we did  when we left sendai there was barely any snow  but it got increasingly more snowy the further we got  the train ride itself was almost worth the trip by itself  you ride parts in between the snowy hills  lovely yamadera itself was one of the highlights of our vacation  the sun was shining  the sky clear and even though the snow was melting the beautiful trees on the hill provided enough shade for the snow to stay afrost on the path up  it even started to snow a little from the trees  and with the statues  shrines  and buildings the whole place felt wonderfully magical  almost like a fairytale of some sort  the hike up was a little slippery  but we brought spikes to wear under our boots  so no problem there  and the view once you get up there is simply awesome   overlooking the village below and the hills on the horizon cow tongue and zunda sayro shakes afterward  we got back to the train station and had a bit of a conversation with the elderly  and quite chatty  station master who was curious to learn where we were from  when we mentioned holland he told us he visited belgium 20 years before and told us  thank you  in dutch  love the little interaction you can have in japan since we got back early in sendai we decided to hit the gachapon and crane machines at a few arcades  i m now the proud owner of a miniature drink machine  shinkansen  and gachapon machine and happy like a kid during christmas about it  we finished the day with sendai s specialties  cow tongue  we both had a curry with it  at rikyu and a  zunda saryo shake   green soybean  shake at the station  both very enjoyable  even for a picky eater like myself  day 8 and 9  hakodate via aomoriafter sendai  we took the shinkansen to aomori  i really wanted to see the  nebuta museum wa rasse  the museum where they store some of the big floats they make out paper and metal over a large wooden frame  with lots of lights inside wa rasse the museum itself is right next to the train station  but you do have to take a train from the shinkansen station to the normal train station first  we reserved about 2 hours for the visit and the train to and from the train station that was exactly right  we even had some time to visit the a factory store next door to grab some locally made apple snacks  including matsushima bay plum cider  yummy it started to snow quite heavily when we got there  apparently  it s the japanese city that gets the most snow during the year  it was nice to see the fields of white  but we were glad it was only a short walk to the museum because i had left my hat and umbrella in the coin locker the floats on display were awesome  they re standing together in a large hall  about 5 of them and some smaller displays  you enter from the second floor  so you get a great overview  after which you can view them up close  there s also a room where they were building a new  small  float and some of the displays are set up so you can touch them and see how they are built  it was a bit of a detour  but totally worth the extra time hakodate after that  we took the last part of the hokkaido shinkansen up to hakodate  we stayed at the hakodate royal  an old four star hotel way past its prime  its a bit out of the way   15 min walk from the station  but it was quite  clean and the room was huge  plus  it was only about 36 euros per night for a 2 person room  so we were quite happy with it we took a tram to the bay area and ate at  lucky peirrot burgers  a local burger chain  it has its charm  each location is different  for instance  one has an angel theme  with christian icons  christmas decorations and other crap on the walls  they play lots of old american music  beach boys  etc and they definitely try to go for that good old us of a burger restaurant vibe  we were a bit shocked to see most of the staff seem to be ladies at or around pension age  working really hard  they seemed happy about it  but then again the japanese never really seem to reveal their true feelings  anyway  i had the chinese chicken burger  the specialty apparently  and tried the fried pork burger for lunch the next day  both were delicious  also tried their drink machine for a yellow can of something bubbly  i think it was a type of drink made of some kind of  superfood  berries  it was ok fireworks in the evening we walked through the hilly area with lights and the different christian denomination churches  hakodate being one of the first harbors to open up after the americans bombed edo and opened up japan to the western world again  the city has clearly had european   western influences  we then took to the  ropeway  up and waited in the blistering  freezing cold wind for the  fireworks  to start in the bay area  minus 15 apparently  some of the school girls were still wearing shorts  shorts  by this time i was wearing my ultrawarm heattech shirt with long sleeves  a thick fleece fest and normal heattech leggingsbined with the windproof jacket and for the first time a hat and gloves  the heattech stuff works really well anyway  the city does 3 firework displays in february and we managed to be there for two of them  yippie  it was worth the wait but also a bit weird to see fireworks from above  finally  the ropeway also has a large souvenir shop and we got our first taste of  donan caramel   made in hokkaido  they have something like 10 flavors  including sapporo beer flavored caramel  we bought the buttery one  obviously delicious  and the ghenkis kahn one  with a smokey  meaty bbq kind of flavor that makes you go   yeah  this ain t right  fun to try though more fireworks next day it was still damn cold so we decided to do a slow day  we walk through all the shops in the red brick warehouses  had some  snaffles cheesecake  if only for the awesome name  we took the tram to the  goryokaku tower  which has great views over the city  bay  the mountains and of course the old ford  the ford was built as a reaction to the introduction of western weapons to japan  guns and cannons  and based on western designs  i didn t read all the info on display  but from what i gathered it was barely used and was turned into a park later on  you can walk inside  not much to see  but still nice to visit for a while our evening ended with our second fireworks display  this time viewed from the bay area  sitting behind us was a bunch of young japanese schoolgirls who some managed to be more loud than the fireworks themselves  no idea what they were talking about  but never heard the word  kawaii  both very softly spoken and somehow shouted at the same time  so many times  the fireworks display was 20 minutes long  kind of slow to build up  but the last 2 minutes were really  really impressive  as if they took all of the fireworks from the precious 18 minutes and shot up the same amount into the air again during the last two minutes   this alone made the trip to hakodate worth the while ,1
regarding long overnight layovers in tokyo  just an fyi for people considering it ,there s a little information about long narita layovers in various forums  and i just wanted to provide an updated disclaimer for people considering it  i recently had 19 hours overnight at narita  i d considered just trying the 9hours capsule hotel  but i had a japanese friend to visit  so i spent the night near ueno   the main point is that the logistics make it kinda expensive  luggage storage and pocket wifi rental will charge you for 2 calendar days even if you re there overnight for less than 24h  wifi rental will run you  gt 2000jpy  as far as i saw  the cheapest tourist sim cards were 3800  if you re good at navigating  you might be able to save this expense and venture into town without it  and bags are about 1000 each at the airport storage counters  you also should have a  plan b  for your luggage  as it is possible for the airport luggage storage places to be full   i took the keisei line into town and went back via asakusa  so about 1300 each way  but in retrospect  i think pre booking the skyliner might have been worth it  there s a bit of time savings and a consistent schedule  if you stay near ueno it s super easy   afaik the airport closes at night  i flew with ana and they would not allow early check in or bag drop even though i arrived with a partner airline  i presumed my stuff would be checked through  but it wasn t   i think i nearly could have done everything by credit card  but if you want to eat at authentic restaurants or buy little things in town then it s still necessary to get some yen in cash  so yeah  the 1 night visit can be fun if you re down for a sleepless night  but it s not cheap or convenient ,1
coffee shop suggestions,my girlfriend and i are going to japan in mid march for the first time  and i was wondering if there are any coffee shops or cafes that anyone would highly rend  we will be in tokyo  osaka  and kyoto  so limit the suggestions to those cities  my girlfriend tends to prefer dark roast coffee while i m more a fan of flavored drinks  so a place with good coffee  a variety of options  and a nice atmosphere would be good  but we re open to most suggestions  thanks ,1
just how quiet is kyoto right now ,so i just arrived in tokyo  and my original plan was to spend a couple of days next week in matsumoto nagano  but i am hearing that due to the coronavirus scare kyoto is unusually quiet at the moment  i ve been to kyoto before but it was really busy and couldn t see everything i wanted to i was wondering if it s noticeably quiet and worth changing my plans to take advantage of some big sights being less crowded  or if kyoto quiet is still pretty busy thanks,1
hort stay in kanazawa or toyama , hi there  i am soon going to japan for some months doing an internship   however  after that  i will still have some time for some traveling  i  have a two week jr pass and plan doing a route from tokyo to kyoto and  osaka  maybe stopping in nagoya or nara  and on the way back take a  route on the west coast  i definitely want to see shirakawago and from there would go to takayama before going back in the direction of tokyo   but i would like to do a stop for a couple of days in a city on the west  coast to travel to shirakawago  so i basically could choose between  kanazawa and toyama  i don t know much about those cities  except  kanazawa has one very popular garden  have you been to either one or even both and can suggest which city would be more fitting for a short stay ,1
ramen and train questions,i m traveling to japan during peak cherry blossom season with a group of 5 other people  i know most ramen shops are small and use a vending machine to order but do we wait for 6 seats to open up together or just go one by one as seats open up also  based on my research  the jr pass is not economical for us since we are flying in to tokyo and out of osaka  should we try to book our shinkansen ticket right when we arrive or are there usually a lot of seats available the day of  i m not sure if i want toit to a set time and have to rush if i could just book it when we are ready to head to osaka  thanks ,1

what is possible  most likely you need a 2nd trip to do all the rest or even a 3rd or 4th  i know that not everyone has the money and time to visit japan on a regular basis  but the thing is  it s just way better doing less  often the best things happen to you by accident and if you have a tight schedule you have no room for surprises  sudden adventures etc  in the end you will have seen a ton of spots  but you will be missing an emotional attachment to it  at least i do right now  but there is also a reason for that i will explain later  it was nevertheless great in japan 2  traveling via bike through kyoto    some streets are a bit narrow  so you must be careful  but all in all it was a wee alternative to walking or public transport and felt liberating  try to pick some places which are easily accessible by bike though  kiyomizu dera for example would be very exhausting for a bike tour  and keep away from the market  because there a big zones where you are not allowed to ride through  i can really rend traveling by bike  it was a great possibility to see the city 3  nikko   doing it the right way    people always tend to focus on the t sh g  shrine and the other shrines in the vicinity  this leaves okunikkopletely unseen  i often read about daytrips to nikko and i want to say that a daytrip to nikko can only give you a shallow overview of the main shrines  but that is not what nikko is all about  the problem in nikko is  that the whole city shuts down after the main tourists spot opening hours and there is literally nothing you can do at night there  you need to be there very early in order to do stuff  beside  visiting the main shrines  you want to take a bus to okunikko which takes around 1 hour to reach lake chuzenji and even longer when going for the senjogahara moor or the yumoto onsen  it s just not feasible to start from tokyo and doing a single daytrip  you cannot see the shrines  and  visit okunikko without it being a total disaster and much stress    in my opinion people should really start staying there overnight  as there are so many hiking routes and tons of other nature stuff to see  like i said  nikko is not only consisting of the main shrines  if you decide to visit nikko and okunikko go for the nikko pass  the buses in nikko are very expensive and the pass is always worth it 4  temple fatigue  my new rule of thumb  don t plan on seeing more than 2 or 3 shrines total on your whole trip  if you really like to  take here and there an extra shrine with you on a spontaneous basis  but don t plan your trips around the shrines  it was still ok for me to see more shrines later  but i m not a shrine or temple gourmet and in retrospective i d have like to spend my time somehow else  it does not apply to every shrine  i know  but once you see one shrine  many other shrines feel boringly familiar 5  jr pass  the jr pass can be great  but if you settle for the route i took i don t see a reason to buy the pass  like at all  you d need to pay  140yen per ride on the yamamoto lane  suica anyone  there is like no benefit from having it in tokyo without doing extensive daytrips  i mean really extensive  and even then  there are great offers to still make the jr pass obsolete  for example  the nikko pass is amazing for the price and it lasts 3 days and covers the buses in the region   it d rend leaving the jr pass out when you are a first timer and don t plan to do much stuff besides tokyo and kyoto  then you should start from nrt hnd and get out of the country from kix and use your money to be flexible on the buses and private subways in the cities in order to not be stuck with jr public transport only    you will notice that the jr pass is mostly useless in kyoto and utterly useless in nikko after you leave the train for example  there are very rare buses in kyoto which are covered by the jr pass  but the buses in kyoto are painful to use  there are traffic jams everywhere  you want to use the subway to for example visit gion  but it is not covered by the jr pass 6  convenient instagram tourism  it s just incredible how you can be at a main tourist attraction with hundreds of people around and barely enough space to walk  but the moment you leave the direct vicinity there is literally no one around  everyone goes to fushimi inari to take a picture  but almost nobody bothers to take the stairs to the upper levels  at the slightest inconvenience people tend to turn around instantly  when your destination is not mentioned or shown in a top 10 to do  you are basically on your own  i find it to be sad that most of the tourists nowadays reduce certain attractions to a background for selfies to post on instagram and treat them like checks on a checklist and don t bother at all to do some more exploration  i d speculate that 90  of the people visiting ryoan ji don t really get what that place is all about  better for me i guess  so i can easily plan around these people 7  food in japan  it s just nice  it can be cheap or expensive and it will taste great  nevertheless  never have i been so convinced of new food in apletely new country  my favourites  tonkotsu ramen und gyukatsu 8  know you partner and be sure about him  see prologue 9  arriving at 7o clock in japan is  really  tough  you have to force yourself through the day and not falling for a little nap  i d try to take a flight which arrives at around 10 o clock if you areing from europe  it s just way easier to survive the day  10  talk to your bank about the holiday and make sure you know all the cardlimits  they blocked my creditcard the day i went to japan  because they wanted to make sure that it did not get stolen  because i had iing charges from japan  switzerland and netherlands  which was uon for them  i fortunately was able to call them and set things right  while i was transitting in fra  that was so incredibly stressful and unnecessary  when i arrived in japan i was unable to withdraw more than 500  but i didn t know why and the atm told me  unknown error  later it turned out the banking agent didn t think i d need more than 500  per day  what also was the limit  so he did not tell me about it  well  thanks for that  everything turned out to be ok then  though  11  october is a very nice month for doing activity loaded schedules and hiking  apart from rain  there was never temperature or moisture hindering us in doing whatever we wanted to be doing  12  nothing get s lost in japan  i love it   i dropped my s pen from my note 9 at a bus stop  i found it aftering back from okunikko     i forgot my sunglasses in gion in a restaurant  i was able to retrieve it the next day    i left my jr pass at a counter in a shop  the cashier quickly sprinted to me to give it back to me    the trust the people place in each other is high  japan sometimes feels like a better place  i know  they have their own problems in society  but this is just a tourists perspective  it s the small things you will notice in japan which makes it so special  for example stuff lying around with no supervision and nobody steals it amp x200b public transport  hotels  hostels i will be outlining the flights and hostels hotels here  because i think it d disrupt the read flow too much and it s clearer that way flights  we flew from ams to fra to hnd via  ana in economy class    our back trip was from nrt to zrh to ams via swiss in economy class   we payed 590  pp  total for both flights  outgoing flight  the ana service was nice  the staff was very attentive  helpful and cared about our wellbeing  the food was great  both breakfast and dinner were great  we had a curry dish for dinner  and we were surprised by the quality and taste  the seat was ok  nothing special  but the entertainment system was simply amazing  the joystick remote was great for playing games like tetris  return flight  the swiss service was bad  the staff was inattentive and didn t really seem to care about our wellbeing  after i dropped my spoon  the first officer took it away from me and told me that he will bring me a new one  but eventually he never came back  the food was ok  but 1 of the 2 dishes they served was instantly out of stock  the seat was beginning to feel ufortable after 3 4 hours and in addition to that my food tray was broken  too  the entertainment system was using a touchscreen which was a pain for playing fast paced games like tetris which need precise inputs  it was really unbearable  they also use a 3 4 3 seating plan for the 777 300er flights instead of a 3 4 2 plan like ana does  the result is a much more cramped experience in the same plane  yes  they install one additional seat per row in economy to transport even more people  all in all  i have already taken a couple of flights through swiss or lufthansa and the economy class service was always kind of similar  nothing special or rather bad when you really need to rely on it  this was my first flight with ana  but i assume that the japanese hospitality ison on their flights  the entertainment system was also way more thought through and what i want to say is that if you have the choice  pick a japanese airline  they have way morefort  it s a small experience for itself  i think  don t get me wrong  i booked my next flights via swiss again  with additional legroom though  because they were the cheapest ones  but i encourage you to book ana  or another jp airline  if your money allows it and you think it s worth it  it is a long flight amp x200b hostels  hotels tokyo   nui  hostel  amp  bar lounge  i know this one because of the countless rendations in the internet  it had nice flair and atmosphere  the rooms were small  standard size in japan i guess  but clean and reasonable for the price  the beds werefortable  even though i hate bed sheets you just place onto the pillow and mattress without them being fixed at all  this hostel just had style and character  it seemed perfect for trying to get to know some new people  because of the lobby bar where people are also drinking together in the evening  it was nothing over the top  but the stay there was very enjoyable  what i didn t like was its  at least a bit  remote location  we needed to walk around 12 15 minutes from the next jr station to the hostel  it s not too bad but sometimes i really thought about picking a place next time which is nearer to a jr station  it s not made better by the fact that you need to make one extra stop to be back on the yamamoto lane  however  if you want your hostel to be more than just your place to sleep  this one is for you  30 35  pp  night   private room  kyoto   piece hostel  this hostel had better rooms  larger   private sink  and bedspared to the nui  hostel and it was located 3min from kyoto station by foot  that was  really  great  it was lacking the flair of the nui  hostel lobby  though  the hostel itself was again very clean and offered some activities on certain days like cooking some okonomiyaki together  it s central location makes it a big rendation  they also offer a free breakfeast included in the price you pay  but let me say  it is very basic  being in japan and loving all the food they have  i quickly started to leave out the free breakfast  because i rather wanted to try out something new and better  even if it costs me something  it was a primilary practical breakfeast and had nothing to do with enjoyment  but it d stay here again without hesitation  30 35  pp  night   private room  nikko   nikkorisou backpackers  again  rended on the internet  reddit this time i think  yes  it is indeed a great place  like the nui  hostel  it s all about the social possibilities here  the social room of the hostel is basically the living room of the owner  he is a nice person talk to and it s fun to share stories with him and the other guests  if i were ever again in nikko  i d stay in that hostel again  there is nothing else to do at night in the city so there will be always some people to talk to in the hostel  a kind of magic experience  because it felt so intimate  the hostel lies central in nikko directly next to the shinkyo bridge and you can visit the main shrines by foot  one big downturn  the beds in the private rooms were the hardest beds i ever slept on  i don t know if i d be able to sleep more than 2 nights on them  make yourself ready for a nice social experience but not the mostfortable rooms  the room we had was big though  35 40  pp  night   private room  nikko    okunoin hotel tokugawa  it was rended by tripadvisor  keep in mind  this way my first stay in a ryokan    everything was perfect  the service was superb  the place and our room  too  the highlight was the private onsen on the balcony directly followed by the massage stool  the private bathtub felt like a heavenlike experience after the long walk at okunikko  but i think the most unbelievable thing was  that they had double layered toilet paper  i wasn t aware that really existed in japan at all     the kaiseki  was another highlight experience on our trip  it is served in a private room  not in  your  room  subtle in its refined taste and arranged like a piece of art  sometimes i wasn t sure what i was eating but it was really nice and i even left nothing    the hotel itself had countless other services like a big private onsen you could rent  a shared public onsen  a relax room with an aquarium  a toy room for kids  a reading room and  you get the idea  2 bad things though  the place is lying a bit up a mountain  so that the road leading there is a bit steep and the hotel is not close to the jr train station  they offer a free bus shuttle service from the jr station  however  use it  it was a pain walking there from the backpackers hostel    also  there was a glass stain on a table in the room  it didn t really bother me  but it was there  for the record    another note  it s basically a ryokan hotel  the rooms look like a ryokan  but it feels like a hotel  metropolitan atmosphere  you go to your room with your shoes on  etc  if you are eager to have a fully traditional ryokan  look for somewhere else  all in all  it was worth it  and i d do it again  i really loved having stayed basic the whole trip and having one day at the end in  full   at least for my standards  luxury  250  pp  p  night   incl  kaiseki  breakfeast   private onsen on balcony  booked as earlybird for a discount  an important lesson i learned  first of all my trip left unfortunately a bad aftertaste  me and my partner are friends since childhood and he was the only person who was interested in a holiday in japan  i was glad he was interested  because i didn t want to travel alone and also had no one else   so we organised the trip  he is a very silent person  rarely shows any enthusiasm and is a very grounded person  i didn t think of it as a big problem i was looking forward to the the trip for quite a long time and i was very enthusistic  even more when we finally arrived in japan  i just couldn t get enough of anything  i was eager to try everything out  in short  i was ready for adventures  ready to spend money  ready to live for the here and now  he was trying to save money  not trying to do anything special and often got upset because of small things i didn t really care about  because i was on my holidays  for example our luggage arriving late  this was the time for which i saved my money and i wanted to enjoy myself to the fullest  but we decided to do the trip together  that means that i try my fullest to not force my partner into stuff  because i think it d unfair  i cannot dictate how someone has to spent their holidays  both have to enjoy theirselves without tresspassing on the freedom of the other person  but each person is also influencing to a great extent the mood of the other person  and if one person has a bad mood all the time or at least shows it all the time the other person will also feel miserable  and my partner unfortunately showed very much of his dissatisfaction about for example prices  crowded places and so on  but that was all clear to me  holidays cost money and tourist places are crowded  figures  and i knew what i was getting myself into  but it didn t seem to be clear to him  one big part of this problem was that my friend believed that kyoto is a rural village and got pretty upset when he saw that kyoto is a very big and crowded city  the day we arrived there he was already done with the city and wanted to leave the city  osaka was even worse and  looked like another tokyo  to him  that s why we skipped mulitple stuff like nightlife activities in osaka  i found myself increasingly unhappy with how the holiday was going to end  we did tons of stuff yes  but i felt knew afterwards that we only went from one place to another because i didn t know how to cope with his negative attitude  in the end we did much but i seldom felt really really happy  my emotional attachment was missing  we for example saw tons of shrines but did not do  one  nightlife activity   there was always something bugging him  if there weren t many people around  something was too expensive  if it wasn t too expensive  there were to many people around  and if neither of both was the case something else was off and we went on what i wanted to say is that you should really think about how you imagine your trip  it was the first time i went on a holiday which was kind of expensive and i had big expectations  and i also know afterwards that they could have been easily met   i didn t know what is important to me and what not  i learned much about what i want and also got to know myself better in that regard  long story short    be sure about  how  you want to see things and be sure if the  personality  of your partner is fitting to your  own expectations  of the trip  also make sure you have the  same attitude  towards your  budget    this is a lesson i learned  i could have waited longer for someone else toe with me on my trip  but i did not  in retrospective i would have prefered to wait 1 or 2 more years i think    please don t confuse what i write with bitterness  it s just the honest truth and my observations of my own choices and what happened  we re still friends and we will stay for a long time  i m pretty sure  i also talked to him about it and we are clean on that topic    with that said  let s get into the tripreport  detailed tripreport day 1  tokyo palace  akihabarathe jetlag was bad  but the day was sunny and kind of hot and we were eager to explore the city due to unfortunate events our first flight was delayed and due to that our luggage arrived later  we only had 10 minutes in fra for transit  we arrived in tokyo at around 7 o clock  we fetched our jr passes and headed for central tokyo we quickly left the central station after a short time of orientation and headed in a slow pace for the tokyo palace and explored the vicinity a bit  nothing too interesting there  but you get a nice metropolis feeling    afterwards we went to akihabara and stayed there for a few hours and awaited the time when our rooms became ready for us  being able to see it for the first time it was a kind of magical experience for me  i m not an otaku or something like that but i do like anime from time to time  it was so bustling and colorful  i have never seen such a place before   we strolled through a few shops and took our first lunch at a ramen restaurant which was extremely tasty  like almost everything in japan  at around 17 o clock we both started to feel an overwhelming fatigue and headed for our hostel  the nuihostel amp x200b day 2  morningstroll   my jin  tokyo government building  meiji shrine  shibuyamy partner decided to wait for the luggage  unable to sleep and contain my anticipation i went ahead and explored akihabara before the opening hours and somehow ended up at the my jin shrine  it was very quiet and calm  i really liked to experience a shrine without any people around  try it yourself after having our luggage delivered to our hotel  it worked really nice  i was afraid not seeing my stuff ever again  and finally being able to change our outfits we headed for shinjuku station to walk to the government building  the building itself is quite massive and not really beautiful but i can rend visiting it if you are looking for a free observation deck of the city  the sight itself is quite good  even though i am not a big fan of city panoramas  if you are there  i d rend taking the free guided tour through the building  you can see the public chambers and stuff  like that if you are into that  look at the pictures  but in the end  i didn t find the vicinity of the government building to be too interesting  if i were a first timer in tokyo now  i d rather pick for example the skytree over the government building  even though you need to pay for it  because i d like to visit the nearby kirby caf  for example  leaving the building we took a stroll through shinjuku central park which was under heavy construction  so we quickly left the meiji shrine itself was our first big shrine to see  i really liked the little  forest  it was located in  you could easily forget that you were in midst of tokyo  the shrine itself was not too spectacular  but nice to see when it became dark  we headed back to shinjuku station and took the train to shibuya  the city was marvelous at night and incredibly beautiful to take pictures of  it s like heaven for a photographer  we went for dinner to gyukatsu motomura  nice ratings on tripadvisor  man  that place is hard to find   if you are in for a quaint and genuine japanese experience  i d go there for dinner  it is a very tiny and kind of cramped restaurant which is difficult to find because it s underground and you need to look out for stairs and not for a front of a restaurant  what ison in the west  the dinner menu ranged from 1500 2500yen and the cutlet was very tender and delicious  i really liked it there due to being exhausted and still jetlagged we called it a day amp x200b day 3  zojoji temple  tokyo tower  roppongi hills  sakurai tea experience  omoide yokochofrom hamamatsuchou station we went to the zozoji temple  in my opinion this temple is a little gem  if you want to have a calm and not very busy temple to visit  it was cloudy and a bit rainy this day so maybe this was the reason that we were almost alone there  the buildings and little statues here and there were nice to watch  and i also liked the contrast between the metropolitan city and ancient temple which can be seen in my photos  if you are looking for a not busy and rather calm shrine you should consider visiting it next was tokyo tower  if you don t enter the tower and pay the entrance fee to go up there  i don t think it s worth the way  i would not consider going there again without going to the observation deck  there wasn t anything to do roppongi hills was very artificial and huge without saying it was bad per se  my friend felt ufortable there  so we left rather quickly  but my impression was that it looked prestigious and wealthy  this place is not a must see at all  but when you like pricy and presumptuous places  why not  i can say that i haven t seen such a place before and it s nice to experience the atmosphere and used building style even though i wouldn t shop there our next stop was at the sakurai tea experience  i have to say that it was one of the highlights of our trip  i can wholeheartedly rend this place and its menu  even if you are not into tea it s still interesting enough just for the experience  the ambience and atmosphere are classy  chic and watching the people preparing and  transforming your tea is very interesting  some teas were very bitter and not really my taste  but like i said it s more about the experience  so i encourage you to try it regardless of your taste  you also get different kinds of candies as a side dish which appear to be carefully selected to add to the flavor of the tea  these are also very delicious  keep in mind the price of around  5000yen for the course and think about making a reservation beforehand our last stop that day was the memory lane  but unfortunately my partner didn t really like this place  so we went back home  sad ing back for it this year again with someone else  it will be great  a very interesting experience  i encourage you to eat something there   amp x200b day 4  typhoondue to the record breaking typhoon all shops  trains and museums were closed the whole day  if you evere into a typhoon during your stay you should try to make the best out of it  if you are staying at a hostel use the time to try to make some new acquaintances  it worked out for me  you are not stuck in the hostel alone  i d even consider roaming the streets a little bit if it s not too bad outside  so you have at least something to do  no  we did not get flooded     amp x200b day 5  tokyo skytree  asakusa shrine  tokyo national museum  kabukich   strollthe next day we were greeted with crystal clear sky and went to the skytree  with the shops still closed till around 13 o clock we didn t have a reason to stay there  we would have liked to look around the shops there  though  on our way to the asakusa shrine we stopped at the sumida park  nothing too special about it the asakusa shrine was beautiful on the outside but in my opinion way too crowded  having seen shrines like the meiji shrine or zozoji temple it didn t feel like it s a must see in tokio  the atmosphere was ruined by the crowds for me  yes  the pagoda is beautiful  but if you visit kiyomizu dera in kyoto  it is not necessary to visit the asakusa shrine at all in my opinion  for me it s the biggest tourist trap we visited in tokyo  best evidence for me was the massive shopping street there selling all kinds of souvenirs  which i didn t find to be good at all i would consider myself interested in japanese culture and history  the national museum offers tons of pieces to look at and read  but it was too much for me  without profound knowledge of the history of japan it s hard to appreciate the different pieces  but if you are really into history and love old school museums the national museum is a must see  i could barely read anymore descriptions of museum pieces after 2 hours  but that does not mean i can say that it is a nice and rich museum  kabukicho was our evening destination where we strolled the street and took some photos  the advertisements are overwhelming at this place  really cool and convincing place for nightlife activities amp x200b day 6  transit  fushimi inariwe took the shinkansen from tokyo to kyoto  very nice experience with the jr pass  it s fast and easy after checking in  it was already dark when we visited the fushimi inari shrine  moody  beautiful  a must see  just keep in mind that the place is utterly crowded during daytime  visit the shrine at night or in the early morning  though i d prefer the evening due to the moody atmosphere  and if you aren t in a hurry take the time and go to the whole top  no  in fact  just do it and  make time  for it  you will be rewarded with nice sights and even less people around you  and bring some drinks with you  the vending machines at the top of fushimi inari are 3 4 times more expensive that the ones at the entry of the shrineplex  sneaky  i bought a 0 5l cola from the machine in my photo for 100 yen  the patience has paid off eventually     amp x200b day 7  kiyomizu dera  ninenzaka  gion   kamo  geisha districtkiyomizu dera was crowded  but it s also kind of spacious  it s a main tourist attraction yes  but due to the proximity to the quaint and beautiful traditional streets around i don t really see a reason not to enter it  a little tip  take the time and take a little walk into the forest which is located behind a fence where the exit street leads up  there will be no people around you  and you can relax a bit from the people and their noise  nice relaxing spot the traditional streets ninenzaka are a must see   really  these are marvelous and picturesque  it s like being in ancient japan  again  take your time and stroll slowly through the streets and visit maybe more shrines around the place when you are still up for it gion had also some nice views  different views  to offer as well as the geisha district  again  simply amazing  just stroll through the streets  the higashiyama district is a very dense traditional district  walking and observing feels rewarding and nice if you are ready for some relaxing  sit next to the inhabitants at kamo river  very very nice spot to relax but beware of the restaurants nearby  they are very pricy  even though offer good food  be prepared to pay extra when you pick a random restaurant in gion  check the prices and services charges first   i paid 700 yen service charge i think and 800 yen for a matcha beer   amp x200b day 8  bike tour  imperial palace  ryoan jifor this day we decided to travel via bike to be able to see more of the city our first stop was the imperial palace  the gardens are vast and there is not so much to see so just go to the palace directly  the palace itself was gorgeous and very visual  there was not much to read  so it felt chill to experience it  theplex itself is in pristine condition next stop was the ryoan ji  big rendation here  the outer garden is free and nice to walk through  you must pay to see the stones though  if you do take your time it will be worth it  try for example meditating a bit while looking carefully at the stones and making out the details  they also have a very nice little store inside where you can buy cool souvenirs for relatively cheap money  i bought 1 3 of my souvenirs there we went back south again and rode through the pre district of kyoto  we enjoyed seeing the little houses and could also watch some japanese people living their everyday lives  i d rend you to pick a spot where people just live and exploring it a bit  no tourist  no crowds  just genuine japanese people living their lives and minding their own business   amp x200b day 9  osaka castle  piece museum osaka  kitchenware street  dotonboriwe did a daytrip to osaka  first stop was osaka castle and it is worth a look and a photo from the outside but don t bother entering it  there is no castle on the inside and you are not able to see any castle chambers or something like that  it s a museum dedicated to the history of osaka s most famous ruler  if i recall correctly  while the information is nice to read it s just unexpected and way too specific to be of interest for hours  it s reminding me a bit of the national museum  too much to read and take in  just leave it out if you are not ready for this  i enjoyed the nearby international peace center pretty much  i just kept in mind that the viewpoint is utterly based and tried to focus on the basic information it tried to convey  in that regard i really liked the museum and we were almost alone there  i rend it if you are into that topic because i wanted to buy a kitchen knife for my father  we went to the kitchenware street  i d consider going there again if i were needing some stuff for my kitchen  the prices are good  and you can  for example  buy some nice dishes for tea or ramen to prepare stuff in them at home  wouldn t it be great to take something of japan back with you and include it in your everyday life  at the end of the day we also had a stroll through dotonbori and took some gorgeous photos  unfortunately  my partner was not really in the mood to do some nightlife stuff  so we headed home  this place was incredible though  if you are in kyoto go to d tonbori for some nightlife activities  it was so incredibly inviting  just beautiful   amp x200b day 10  oharanext day we took the bus to ohara  a village nearby to kyoto  the sanzenin temple was one of the most beautiful and best temples i had seen  i liked the rural touch and the mossy grass which covered the ground  ohara itself was also worth exploring but it rained pretty much so we retreated home because of my partner  also  big rendation here  look at the photos to get an idea of the place  i really liked this place   amp x200b day 11 we spent the days independent of each other  i dropped off at the golden pavilion by happenstance  so i went for it  the whole place seemed like a giant sellout to me  the pavilion was shielded off with walls  so you were only able to see it after paying the entrance fee  in addition to that you could only see how incredibly overrun this place was when you entered the area  i quickly left    i used the rest of the time to revisit some highlight spots in kyoto and took my time for some nighttime photography  it was my way to say goodbye to kyoto  i think the pictures speak for themselves   amp x200b day 12  transit  shinkyo bridgewe transited to nikko via shinkansen  by the time we reached the hostels it was already dark and let me tell you nikko ispletely dead by then  there is nothing going on there past 17 18 o clock  we strolled around the closed shrineplex and got an overview of the city  the shinkyo bridge was lying direct next to our hostel  so we inspected it  it s a nice bridge  but you cannot cross it at night  and you must pay entrance during the day  so we went to bed and i socialised myself with the hostel guests in the living room  felt great   amp x200b day 13  kegon waterfall  lake chuzenji  roykan   kaisekibecause of what the people in the hostel told us we changed our plans and did not visit the toshogu shrine and went for okunikko instead  in order to dodge the crowds  the bus ride to okunikko was very curvy and it s hard to get a seat in the full buses  it was around 45min long  the kegon waterwall was impressive  we wandered around the lake chuzenji and explored a few rural streets leading away from the main streets  we found to not have enough time to do some serious hiking  because we wanted to be back at our ryokan at around 16 o clock in order to enjoy our stay there  so basically  we didn t do much  but let me say  that the region is beautiful  and i want toe back some day to do some hiking we relaxed ourselves and stayed the rest of the day in the ryokan  it was great  originally  i wanted to head out for the kanmangafuchi abyss but just couldn t bring myself to leave the hotel  the massage seat was too powerful  a appropriate highlight for the last real day of our trip   amp x200b day 14  transit to tokyowe strolled through akihabara and said goodbye to japan  nothing special happened  but i now know that i want to try out pachinko   amp x200b day 15headed to nrt via subway and took good memories with us     endfinal words  all in all it was a nice experience  i really  love  this country  i wille back this year and i really cannot wait any longer  it will be great  for sure   anyone who is unsure  you have to try it  you cannot do much wrong when you decide to spent your holidays in japan  i hope you enjoyed my tripreport and the photos i took   see you ,1
buying tickets for preseason baseball game ,i m interested in going to one of the tigers buffaloes preseason games from march 13 15  i found a really nifty guide in english online for how to buy tickets for tigers games  but i guess because they re playing away at the osaka dome  they don t have those dates listed  i can t find any english guide online on how to buy tickets through a buffalo site  so i m not sure what my other options might be  i ve looked into japanball  and it seems helpful  but i m really hoping to save my money for other stuff on the trip i really  really want to make one of these games is there anything i should know before going to one  etiquette  how are the concessions  price of souvenirs ,1
psa re jal seats on codeshare flights,i ve seen a few posts on here about japan airlines seat selection being unavailable until 24 hours before check in when flights are booked via american airlines codeshare  apparently as of october 2019  you can select seats ahead of time via phone with an aa rep  the jal person said i may need to call a few times until i get a rep who is appropriately trained  but it actually worked out the first time i called  if you run into issues  call jal   they can follow up with aa via a special customer service line if needed  this was for an o  fare  low cost but not sure if it s the lowest tier  flight   there may be a few tiers ineligible for this but my tickets were definitely in a fare class that previously only allowed seat selection 24 hours before the flight ,1

lake yugama mount kusatsu shirane volcanic activity  duration  what else to do from yamamouchi nagano ,hi folks  my partner and i booked a couple of days up in yamamouchi  near yudanaka station  in may to see the monkeys  yes  but we were also hoping to be able to get the bus across to kusatsu onsen and see the yugama crater lake from the shirane rest house as well  as of earlier this month  that road is under restrictions due to volcanic activity  so it may be that even when it s no longer closed for the winter  we still can t see anything  or can t even go that way unless we hire our own car since the public transport would be off   big financial ouch when we re already covered by the jr pass  probably a grey area for our travel insurance too anyone know how long this restriction due to volcanic activity might continue  is it pretty much certain that we can t see that area now  or might it settle down if it remains closed  what else can we do with our other day in yamamouchi   after spending the previous day trying out onsen and seeing the monkeys ,1

jr kyushu hotel blossom shinjuku vs sunroute plaza vs prince hotel,hi   i currently have a reservation for the shinjuku price hotel   i wanted to stay at the sunroute plaza but at the time they didn t have any rooms   it looks like now rooms have opened up for sunroute plaza for my dates   while i was looking on  b ooking  i came across the kyushu blossom hotel   logistics wise  sunroute and kyushu look like they might be easier to get to from the station  but prince hotel looks closer to the  action  area   for reference  i am a solo female traveler in my 40s who won t be doing much bar hopping    i am mostly worried about rolling my luggage to the  prince hotel when i take the bus  from haneda   of these three  for those that know the shinjuku area  is there a better side of the station be on on convince wise   thanks in advance ,1

new takuhaibin in town  anyone used ca go before ,has anyone used ca go dot jp before  i know yamato cat is the go to service and there are a few others  but ca go s post card ad popped up in my capsule hotel luring me with a 1500yen   150 tax for single piece  you pay by cc via online  theyunicate with you thru whatsapp fb msger or line  and u send them a pic of your luggage they do previous day pickup for deliveries prior to 1pm and same day pickup delivery for flights b w 3pm and 12am and will go to your hotel in the relative tokyo region  and their weight limit is 23kg 50lbs and a pretty large size vs a lot of others that charge by size and weight  sometimes maxing out at 15kg my original plan was two heavy duty boxes to fit in a single large 74 x 44 x 33cm  box for just under 800 yen for all 3 con is that it was going to take two separate trips to haneda to check it in due to my makeshift dolly failing  surprisingly dollys at the home improvement store i bought the boxes fell under 2000 yen but what was i gonna do with an extra dolly after i got to the airport  send it back with the rest of my stuff  jal biz class does allow 3 items up to 70lbs i was going to 1  pack heavy items in backpack to carry2  pack heavy items in rolling luggage to roll3  pack light items in box so it can easily roll w  the luggage4  arrive at hnd with packpack  rolling luggage  box and re pack everything into box and rolling luggage as arranged the night prior5  return to hotel and re pack backpack accordinglyi confirmed with jal that i can check in my bags at 6am the same days as my flight   plan was to bring a bunch of kombini snacks as well in my checked in luggage so there s the rush of packing those the same morning to ensure i get fresh ones  throwing a strong zero in with the onigiri to keep  em cool   for 1650yen and online credit card payment with constantunications via line vs 2500yen average for what i ve seen  seems like a great deal  granted its only in the tokyo area and only forwarding form your to the airport  ,1
local driving tips ,hey  i m currently in japan with a rental car  i m from the us and consider myself a pretty good driver  but could use some tips on local driving etiquette  i have the following questions that mostly apply to the impossibly narrow roads here 1  who goes first on a one lane bridge  related  who has the right of way on a narrow section of road  or when there s a dropoff on one side 2   i had to back up for three blocks with rearview mirrors tucked in when a street inexplicably turned to a footpath  are there warning signs or markings that mean dead end or  this road is too small for a car 3  i see people pull over all the time to let you pass so i ve been doing the same  is there a law about this  like   of vehicles stacked up behind you  also  is there a signal that means you want to overtake another vehicle 4  any circumstances where you can turn left on red 5  what are the speed limits when unposted  finding differing information on this online 6  posted speed limits can be laughably slow   like 50kmh on wide stretches of highway with no development  and i see people everywhere going like 30kmh over the limit  i ve also seen 0 cops but would prefer to not get ticketed  what s the official unofficial tolerance for speeding here  are there speed cameras or other traps i should watch out for any other tips on being a good driver in japan  thanks for the responses p s  please no  just take the train type answers  ,1
 itinerary check  14 days in tokyo  osaka  kyoto in april 2020,hey guys so  i had a totally different itinerary planned out and most of my aodations are already booked although i do have free cancellations so i can make changes to them  this is our first trip to japan and i wanted it to fall during the cherry blossom season but i found out that cherry blossom is going to be way earlier than anticipated this year and we will probably miss out on it so i changed up the itinerary  the initial one had too many day trips to nikko  miyajima island  matsumoto to view cherry blossoms but i think this is more realistic and doable i know some days it seems like we have too much planned and we do  but we absolutely don t have to do everything on the list  this is more of a guidline and i am okay to take or add a few things here and there  both my husband and i are experienced travellers and on most of our trips we walk 8 10 hours with small breaks here and there  we both don t drink and are not that much into night life other than seeing the city lights at night and some night photography  so based on what we like  i have planned this out in a way that made the most sense with not too many hotel transfers so we don t have to carry our luggage every other day i want your honest opinion on my revised itinerary  is there anything you would add or take outpletely  i am confused about planning out april 15 17 not sure where to stay  this part of the trip i have not booked any aodations for yet  i also have not bought a jr pass yet because i don t thik the cost of it makes sense since we won t be going to too many cities  based on this itinerary  do you think we should get a jr pass thanks all in advance april 3   arrival at haneda 6pm  go to hotel and just sleep through the night  hopefully april 4   tokyo  west  shinjuku gyon national gardon  meji shrine  yoyoji park  takeshita street to omotesando street  tokyu plaza  shibuya crossing  evening  omoide yokocho  golden gai  robot restaurant  maybe  tokyo metropolitan building april 5   tokyo  east  senso ji temple  asakusa jinja shrine  ueno  keon park  tosho gu shrine  akihabara  tokyo skytree  maybe april 6   tokyo disney sea  optional  we might take a rest day and not go to disney or make a day trip to nikko depending on how we feel april 7   more of a chill day mostly in and around imperial palace  if there is still cherry blossom we might go boating at kitanomaru keon park  yasukuni shrine  shopping maybe april 8   tokyo to kyoto  will try to catch the first train   nw and center      kinkaku ji  the golden pavilion      ninna ji     kurama dera temple     nijo castle     optional  imperial palace april 9   kyoto  west  arashiyama bamboo forest  tenryu ji  jojakkoji   gioji  adashino nenbutso ji  daikakuji temple  stroll through arashiyama on the way back to the station april 10   kyoto  east  kiyomizu dera   first thing in the morning  higashiyama district  kiyomizu zaka  sannen zaka  and ninen zaka  kodai ji  gion district and kennin ji  chion in temple through maruyama park  nanzenji temple  philosophers path   optional  eikando temple     optional  yoshida hill temples and shrines  urodani temple  shinnyodo temple  and yoshida shrine   optional  yasui konpira gu april 11  kyoto  south  fushimi inari shrine  tofuku ji  maybe  higashi hongan ji and nishi hongan ji april 12   kyoto to osaka    osaka castle  umeda sky building  floating garden observatory  himeji castle  dotonbori area april 13    day trip to nara from osaka april 14    osaka to nagoya to tokyo  the only reason to stop in nagoya is to visit the toyota plant and museum as my husband is a huge japanese car enthusiast april 15    tokyo to mount fuji day trip  should we stay overnight or make this a one day trip april 16   tokyo   bay area  teamlabs borderless  odaiba  rainbow bridge  toyota megaweb  optional  teamlab planets april 17   tokyo april 18   leave tokyo from narita ,1

shows experiences similar to teamlab exhibitions ,i went to japan solo for a month this past fall and loved it  i really want to go back as soon as possible  and since my mom absolutely loves cherry blossom trees i thought it might be nice to bring her with me this time in the spring and center our visit around that  however  my mom also  loves  anything that has to do with lights or projections or holograms  she saw my videos from when i went to borderless and planets and really wants to go  i m planning to take her there and also to the robot resteraunt and tokyo disneasea  maybe also to the techno circus  although i didn t go there the last time i was in japan  so if anyone has any opinions on whether it s worth it i d appreciate your input does anyone have any rendations on other places i could take her  it does not have to be in tokyo since we ll be hitting several spots throughout japan all through april of next year  2021 ,1

itinerary check  first time in japan  11 days in tokyo osaka kyoto in april 2020,  hey all  i ve been lurking in this sub for months  and i m excited to finally be posting an itinerary  i m going to japan for 11 full days this april  leaving chicago on 4 1 20 and returning 4 13  i m going with a good friend  and this will be both of our first time in japan  we are both so hyped for this trip i ve got more travel experience and i m kind of a control freak  where he is indecisive as hell  so i am doing 100  of the planning here  i like to research thoroughly before traveling so i know all my options  but try to keep itineraries as more of an outline than a schedule  both of us have traveled enough to know we aren t the kind of people who want to check off every box on the tourist checklist  and i m very much okay with missing some of the  essentials  if they don t really interest us  some of the things we re most excited about are food  hopefully enjoying some beautiful cherry blossoms  nightlife  spending time outside in nature  or gardens parks  and more food  we love pokemon  nintendo  and ghibli  but aren t otherwise that interested in anime  the itineraries i ve set for each day are more like possibilities than a set schedule  i have a few specific questions  but any all feedback would be much appreciated amp x200b thursday 4 2  tokyo day 1  land in tokyo at 2 00pm  pick up wifi and cash at airport  take nrt express to shinjuku  check into airbnb and drop off stuff  walk around shinjuku  eat  drink  stay awake  would it be crazy to book a  shinjuku izakaya

store  niku yokocho  katsu midori conveyor sushi  golden gai our airbnb is very close  so i think we will end up here most nights  where in the area should we check out for karaoke  we re both ready to sing our hearts out  but it s not as fun with just two people  if there are any lgbtq bars in the nichome area that also have karaoke  that would be a dream amp x200b saturday 4 4  tokyo day 3  tsukiji market for sushi breakfast  sushizanmai    pokemon caf  akihabara  super potato retro shop  shopping  maybe check out an arcade    nakameguro for evening cherry blossoms  dinner at 9pm at sushisho masa  this is the only reservation we have right now  which was a very generous gift from my mom  has anyone been  we are so so excited to gorge ourselves amp x200b sunday 4 5  day trip to lake kawaguchi  this day and friday 4 3 are interchangeable  hopefully one of these two days will be clear enough to see fuji  take early morning train from shinjuku station  kaichi ropeway  take bus from ropeway base to kawaguchiko natural living center  walk clockwise around lake across kawaguchiko ohashi bridge to oike park  chureito pagoda  eat at fuji tempura idaten amp x200b monday 4 6

x200b tuesday 4 7  tokyo day 5 osaka day 1  oedo park  ameyoko street food  midday train to osaka  we re staying in osaka for 3 nights  mainly using it as a hub for day trips and enjoying all the food and nightlife   check into airbnb near namba station  kuromon market  dotonburi amp x200b wednesday  4 8  day trip to koyasan  i know this is a lot of traveling for a day trip  but i m so excited for this because it looks ethereally beautiful and peaceful  okoniun cemetary  torado hall  i considered making this an overnight  but the temple stay doesn t really appeal much to either of us amp x200b thursday  4 9  day trip to   option 1  nara and mt yoshino  option 2  arashiyama tenryu ji temple and gardens  monkey park  i still need to flesh either of these out  neither of us have any interest in the bamboo grove  but would it be crazy to skip arashiyama altogether  nara and mt  yoshino would be a long day  but doable  i think  any input here would be awesome amp x200b friday  4 10  kyoto day 1  early morning train to kyoto  check into hotel and store luggage  we re staying at rinn gion kenninji anyone been  hike kibune to kamura  kamura onsen so  i ve read all the threads about the onsen experience for trans and nonbinary people  but haven t seen anything specific to other queer folks  i m a soft ish butch lesbian  any input on what that experience would be like  if anyone has been to this specific onsen  any info would be great  philosophers path  amp  ginkaku ji  add nanzen ji and keage incline if not too worn out  pontocho  kishi kishi omurice amp x200b saturday  4 11

payments reverted by teamlab planets ,hi i have prebooked tickets for teamlab planets which i payed using revolut to avoid fx fees  last night i had a notification on revolut saying the payment had been reverted  googling about the issue  revolut says  if the merchant has yet to accept your payment and 7 or more days have passed  the funds may be reverted back to your account   dependent on the transaction type  alternatively a merchant can cancel a payment at the point of sale  due to security issues  the teamlab website doesn t help either now  has anyone had this issue before  is my reservation still valid but will i have to pay again there  or did i just lost my reservation thanks in advance,1

2 week japan itinerary check,i m heading to japan in a week and want to get some feedback on my plans initially i was going to watch my mom run the tokyo marathon but that was cancelled yesterday  my husband and i purchased a 14 day japan rail pass because we weren t sure how many day trips out of tokyo we were planning in the first week  originally we were just going to go from tokyo to hiroshima and back  but takayama and shirakawa go look amazing so i m hoping i can make it there  please let me know what you think day 1 through 6    tokyo shinjuku one day at disney seas maybe a day trip to nikko or hakone day 7   8   kyoto day 9    osaka spend most of it in fushimi inari taisha and nara day 10   hiroshima to kanazawa   hiroshima peace memorial museum in the morning  maybe miyajima or himeji after day 11   shirakawa go day 12   takayama day 13  nagoya day 14   narita airport   home amp x200b thanks for any feedback you can provide ,1
how is fukushima and niigata for cherry blossoms  sakura ,i ve been to japan several times for cherry blossoms  mostly in the kansai area  i was thinking to visit somewhere different this time  i saw on japan guide there are some beautiful sakura blossoms at a park near fukushima city  and i figured i d add niigata to the trip as well any thoughts or experiences on these places for sakura  especiallypared to kansai area  my other hope is that fukushima and niigata would be less crowded and less touristy than osaka  nara  etc  has gotten in recent years ,1

would you take the bullet train from nagano to kyoto for a day trip or would that be too much ,hey  guys  would it be too much to take the shinkansen from nagano to kyoto  spending the day in kyoto  and then take the shinkansen back to nagano before nightfall  i have the jr pass but originally planned to spend most my time in nagano  that was until i saw that kyoto is practically emptied of tourists  now i m considering just going for a day anding back to my hotel in nagano ,1

opportunity to see a geisha show during autumn ,hi everyone  i m planning a 30 day trip to japan in the late fall in 2021 to see the autumn foliage  so the months i d be planning this trip would fall on maybe october or early november  i have been to japan once before two years ago and i stayed in kyoto  osaka and tokyo  i have no fixed cities yet planned for this uing trip one of my long time dreams is to see a maiko geisha dance  i would be prepared to pay a rather high sum of money to realize this dream  with the absolute maximum being 500 600 euros for the show   it is a once in a life time thing  after all my partner is incredibly socially awkward and does not want to participate in this if there s a lot of people watching the show or if there s any sort of social interaction between the guests geishas  he does not want participate in any interaction and would feel anxious because of that  so  a small  private show would be best but not  absolutely  necessary so  my questions henceforth are  1   are there any opportunities to see a geisha maiko dance during the fall  2  is there a possibility to get a more private show  and 3  and how much this would approximately cost  thank you in advance  and sorry for any possible typos as i m not a native english speaker ,1
trying to find a lake ashi private onsen i saw in a video once,there was vlog on youtube at some point last year of a woman who visited a place where each room had their own little private onsen  a public infinity pool  and a place to dip your feet in that looked over lake ashi  the video got taken down or privated as i can t find it anymore  would anyone happen to know of this place something similar  i remember in the video she mentioned it was near an odd train stop and seemed sort of hidden off the beaten path   i ll be visiting the hakone area with a friend may 14th 15th and am looking for a private onsen location as my friend isn t on board with the whole public pool of indecency idea ,1
fall colors trip report   two weeks in tokyo  amp  kyoto  with pictures ,hello japantravel  i visited this subreddit just about every day for a year when i was planning my trip  and i found these types of trip reports to be immensely helpful  i m hoping i can return the favor amp x200b about us we are an american couple in our 20s  our priorities for this trip  experiencing the culture  history  art  pop culture  etc  getting out in some nature  and eating great food  we weren t very interested in nightlife  apologies for the iing novel amp x200b day 1 we landed in haneda at about 3 pm local time and picked up our pocket wifi  we used ninja wifi and had noplaints  we only got one pocket wifi to share  but we re such independent travelers that we really should have gotten one for each of us amp x200b we exchanged our 7 day jr vouchers at the airport  only waiting about 5 10 minutes in line  we also got our pasmo cards at the airport  as far as i could tell  there s no difference between pasmo and suica  just use whichever machine you find first amp x200b we took the train from the airport to our hotel  which was only a 30 min train ride from the airport  with no transfers a huge plus with luggage  we arrived at our hotel   sotetsu fresa inn tokyo kyobashi  at around 5 pm  we absolutely loved this hotel  it was conveniently located  with several metro stops less than 5 minutes walking distance away  the room was small  but that seems to be the standard for japanese hotel rooms amp x200b after settling in and washing up  we walked about 10 minutes to tokyo station to find something to eat  we opted for the world famous  and shockingly inexpensive   rokurinsha  in  tokyo station s ramen alley  you seriously could not ask for a better first meal in japan  definitely order the classic  tsukemen   dipping noodles amp x200b we explored the  tokyu hands  in tokyo station  and i got myself a cute  goshuincho  this is a special book that you take to all of the shrines and temples  at each one  you pay a small fee for a site specific calligraphy signature and stamp  and it bes a  beautiful log of all the shrines and temples  you have visited  tokyu hands had a good selection  but i definitely saw some later on that were more my style  nevertheless  this is definitely my favorite souvenir from the trip  and one of my prized possessions  if my house ever catches fire  this is one of the things i m grabbing first amp x200b amp x200b day 2 jet lag reared its ugly head bright and early  we decided to give into it and were soon out the door on our way to our first official stop   senso ji  in  asakusa  i honestly think this is the  best way to experience  senso ji  at least the first time  it was so peaceful  before all the shops opened up  and the tourists came flooding in  it was also fun to look at all of the  painted shop shutters  which you wouldn t normally see during the day amp x200b after i got my  first  goshuin stamp  we walked over to  kappabashi dori  aka kitchenware street  my favorite store was  four floors of nothing but cookie cutters  my husband spotted a stag beetle one that we ended up taking home  i love beetles and icing sugar cookies so really there s no betterbination  we also splurged on some nice chopstick sets in a boutique looking store that we found amp x200b for lunch we went to  hasagawa  a michelin starred tonkatsu restaurant  i swear time stopped when i took my first bite of that tonkatsu  they have different pricing tiers for different cuts of pork  and i highly rend having at least one person in your party splurge on the more expensive one  it s about  30  utter heaven amp x200b after lunch  we walked over to the  edo tokyo museum  we are both big museum people so we loved reading all of the placards and looking at all of the exhibits  we lasted about two and a half hours before exhaustion took over and we headed back to the hotel for a nap  i know sometimes a nap isn t rended  but i don t see the point of forcing yourself to enjoy things under the influence of total exhaustion amp x200b we woke up from our nap at around 6 pm  and decided to check out  anata no warehouse  this wasn t originally on our itinerary  but it was closing soon and figured  why not   it was packed  but we had a blast and even got to play the famous taiko drumming game  it s a shame this place closed   we definitely would havee back amp x200b amp x200b day 3 another bright and early morning  but at least a little less bright and early than the one before  we walked to tokyo station to reserve our shinkansen seats to kyoto  which was extremely easy to do amp x200b from tokyo station  we took the train to ueno to visit the tokyo national museum  we arrived at the museum right when they were opening and got in pretty quickly  despite the busloads of tourists  i have to admit that i didn t love the tokyo national museum as much as the edo tokyo musuem  in total fairness  my husband liked the tokyo national museum more than edo tokyo so it probably justes down to personal preference amp x200b we ended up at unatoto  for lunch to try  unagi don   eel over rice  this was a longer wait than we would have liked  but the food was really delicious and cheap  do you see a pattern emerging  i practiced ordering in japanese for the first time  which was unnecessary  thanks to the universal language of pointing  but really fun amp x200b after lunch we scoured ameyoko to satisfy our sweet tooths  mine is especially relentless  we ended up spending about  60 on candy  which is not out of character for me amp x200b we stopped in the seven story yamashiroya toy store  which was overwhelming  new drinking game for this trip report  take a shot every time i say  overwhelming  then call an ambulance  to say the least  but we had fun looking at all of the differently themed floors  including the pepto bismol colored floor entirely devoted to kirby amp x200b speaking of figurines  our next stop was akihabara we have a couple of anime shows we really like  attack on titan  hunter x hunter  and we both like video games  however  this is where i realized that i don t have much stamina for window shopping  as opposed to my husband  who could treasure hunt all day  we poked our heads in  super potato   sort of overrated imo  rifled through  mandarake  and got some  gachapon  warning  gachapon are strangely addicting  if you re not careful  you could find yourself dropping 400 yen on the mere chance of getting a mr  snuffelupagus figure even though you haven t watched sesame street in 20 years  not that i would know anything about that amp x200b once i snapped out of my gachapon induced trance  we quickly hustled over to kanda myojin  before their goshuin office closed  this was a really splendid little shrine that made up for an otherwise overwhelming  take a shot  akihabara experience amp x200b our final stop of the night was meidai dori aka guitar street  which is exactly what it sounds like my husband is a musician  and his one goal for the trip was toe home with a new electric guitar  specifically something from fender japan  i went to a nearby starbucks and rested my feet for a little bit while he browsed  i have no shame in this decision  he found a guitar he liked  but he wanted to look in a few more places before making a final decision amp x200b we found a small tendon  tempura over rice  place with good reviews called  tempura hachimaki  where we were seated next to a very nice japanese couple  the food was amazing and thepany was delightful  i forgot to take a picture of this meal  but  here s one i found on google  that looks exactly like what we got amp x200b overall  this day was exhausting  i definitely tried to pack too much in on this day  to top it all off  we had talked about maybe tacking on a late night in shinjuku to this day  which is hilarious in hindsight  if you re taking any cues from this itinerary  definitely only do like 50 60  of the things on this day amp x200b amp x200b day 4 this morning started off at  meiji shrine  this place was absolutely stunning and we really enjoyed our time here  it helped that the weather was perfect   we especially enjoyed the  painted sake barrels  and watching all of the bridese through with their  vermillion umbrellas  i don t know if that happens every day or just sundays amp x200b from there we walked to the  ukiyo e ota memorial museum of art  this was definitely a highlight of tokyo for me  i m a woodblock print fan in general  and this small museum was so quaint and peaceful  it was such a charming contrast to the sensory overload of the day before  it only took an hour to walk through  and we were going slowly amp x200b after the museum  we took the train to  shibuya  this wasn t originally on the itinerary and to this day i m still not sure what possessed us to do this  i ll go ahead and end the suspense and say shibuya was not my vibe at all i clearly couldn t even be bothered to take a decent picture of it  all i got out of it were our disney sea tickets at the  disney store  and a half hearted picture with  hachiko  a family member rended  ichiran  for lunch  so we got in a very deceptive line and waited  and waited  and waited  all told  we waited about an hour and a half for this ramen  don t get me wrong  it was good  but not wait 90 minutes and get in a hangry spat with your spouse good amp x200b bellies full of ramen and hearts full of ire  we finally made it to  shimokitazawa  we love thrift and record shopping so we were really excited about this place  honestly  i wish we could have spent more time here  we both got some awesome pieces of clothing from a thrift store called  kinji  we also stopped in  flash disc ranch  to look at records amp x200b the sun went down and we walked over to  shirohige s cream puff shop  for the famous  totoro cream puffs  this little cafe was so darling  especially at night with all of the lights  and the cream puffs were not only adorable but also extremely delicious amp x200b amp x200b day 5 we re off to kyoto amp x200b we rolled our suitcases over to tokyo station and took the shinkansen to kyoto  if you haven t been to tokyo station yet  definitely give yourself some extra time to get oriented this place is huge  and don t forget to grab some  ekiben  for the ride  this was day 1 of our 7 day jr rail pass  for those of you keeping track amp x200b the shinkansen was as delightful andfortable as everyone says it is so much better than a plane  if you re going from tokyo to kyoto  make sure to look for mt  fuji about 45 minutes in he s on the righthand side amp x200b we arrived at kyoto station at about 10 30 am and stored our luggage in the coin lockers  we found the coin lockers very easy to use  but by mid morning  availability was already starting to run low  we were very fortunate to find space for our larger suitcase amp x200b from the station  we made our way to the  kyoto pokemon center  it s not a huge store  but it has a lot of unique items and was my favorite of the pokemon centers  definitely a must see if you love pokemon  like we do amp x200b we then walked to  yasaka shrine  this is when i realized that kyoto was going to be way more my speed than tokyo  it was really fun to see all of the women taking pictures in their extravagant kimonos amp x200b after yasaka shrine  my husband and i split up to tackle different parts of town  he wanted to look at some more guitar stores  and i wanted to wander around  gion  i ended up taking the pocket wifi since t mobile was supposed to cover him internationally  we agreed to meet back by the kyoto station coin lockers at a certain time if something went wrong amp x200b i got a delicious  matcha soft serve from   tsujiri  and began my aimless wandering  the clouds were starting to roll in  and the diffused sunlight made the city look absolutely beautiful  i walked around a quiet corner and stumbled upon a tiny little temple tucked in between houses called  shoden eigin in  i  wandered in  and was delighted to find i was the only person there  i walked the path through a  small cemetery  which led to the most serene little  zen garden  i sat down on the deck and looked out at the zen garden for almost an hour   just taking it all in  there are also some gorgeous partition paintings that you can observe up close  i ll say it again  be open to experiences outside of your itinerary amp x200b i kept wandering through gion and stumbled upon yet  another temple  and went inside  this ended up being  kennin ji  overall  i think this temple is very underrated and should be higher on most tourism lists  the  huge dragon mural on the ceiling  was one of my favorite pieces of art i saw on the trip  this temple also had a large  zen rock garden  that i spent a long time looking out on  i tried my best to capture the scene  but an  amateur photo  can never do it justice amp x200b the temple was closing and it was just about time to meet my husband at kyoto station  at this point  the sun was gone  the rain wasing down pretty hard  and i was probably the only idiot in japan without an umbrella  i arrived at the coin lockers and waited for my husband  and waited  and waited  about an hour later i finally saw him  soaking wet and looking utterly lost  poor guy s cell phone service wasn t working and he had been wandering around kyoto for an hour and a half trying to find our meeting place  he looked so sad and wet that i couldn t even be upset about the wait  so word to the wise  just spend the extra money and get everyone a pocket wifi amp x200b we grabbed our luggage and took the bus to our aodations  we had some friends who invited us to stay with them in a  beautiful traditional teahouse  for a week  it was only a 5 minute walk to kinkakuji  which is great if you want to go to kinkakuji  but not great if you want to go anywhere else  it was not fun being 40 minutes away from kyoto station  but it was all worth it for the ambiance and the wonderfulpany of our dear friends  if you re using this itinerary as a guide  i would rend staying closer to kyoto station or higashiyama amp x200b amp x200b day 6 we started our morning with our friends at  fushimi inari   i wasn t sold on hiking to the summit  but it ended up being as worth it as everyone says it is  less people  more interesting things to see  and higher likelihood of encountering  friendly cats  i m not in shape  but i managed the hike just fine  we took frequent breaks for  ice cream  and  picture taking  which helped  we were blessed with  great weather  on this day  i can imagine this being a much more miserable trip in the summer amp x200b we made it back down and grabbed a yummy  spiral potato stick  from one of the various food stalls at the foot of the shrine  we found a little place right outside fushimi inari called  wagyuuu  we ordered two bowls of wagyu beef over rice  about  10 each  every bite was absolutely heavenly  my husband says this was his favorite meal of the trip  i don t think i can pick a favorite  but this is up there amp x200b after lunch we went to  tofukuji  this is absolutely unmissable if you are in kyoto during fall colors  just stunning  i know cherry blossoms get all the hype  but this fall foliage was something else amp x200b we made our way back to kyoto station where we ate some conveyer belt sushi  it was a good option  especially for a group  nothing to write home about  but nothing toplain about either amp x200b from kyoto station we traveled to  daigoji  for autumn illuminations  this is a special event during fall foliage where some of the temples open after hours with special lighting on the maple leaves  this is another unmissable experience if you are in kyoto mid late november  this temple is a little out of the way  about a 30 min bus ride from kyoto station  but it is so pretty  there was also a surprising lack of people i would go as far as to call this a hidden gem amp x200b we headed back to the house  where my friends introduced me to the concept of eating a mini matcha ice cream from 7 11 before bed every night  is it weird that this is one of the things i miss most about japan amp x200b amp x200b day 7 my husband and i split from our friends and headed to  nara  on the way  we stopped at  byodoin temple  in uji  this was a really cool temple  but in hindsight  we kind of wish we would have skipped this and spent more time in nara instead amp x200b we arrived at nara station  which is a bit of a walk from nara park  on the way we got a  huge bowl of ramen  at a place called  genkishin  it was pretty good  but not our favorite from the trip  the walk to the park is actually really nice  and it s where we started to notice that even the  sewer grates  in japan are beautiful amp x200b we met our friends at  nara park  and took all of the obligatory photos of the  deer  they looked  perfectly healthy and happy  to me  not that i m any sort of deer veterinarian  we didn t experience any  aggressive behavior   from humans or deer amp x200b we made our way to  todaiji  which was mind blowing  pictures of the giant buddha do little to capture its massive scale  you can also really see the difference between the  old and new   well  relatively speaking  temples here  i was glad i had read up a little bit on the history of  japanese architecture  beforehand amp x200b we then went to  kasuga taisha  which was nice  i don t know if i d put it in the same  unmissable  category as some of the other things in this trip report  but there s no reason not to go if you re already in nara park  the  grounds  looked stunning in the  good weather amp x200b for dinner we tried the famous  coco ichibanya  and it was as good as they say it is  we got the impression that nara didn t have a lot of food options  but this was right on the way from nara park to nara station amp x200b overall  i think it would be criminal to already be in kyoto and not visit nara  you don t need more than one day there  in my opinion amp x200b amp x200b day 8 we started our morning at the  toji flea market  which takes place on the 21st of each month  this was a really cool place to poke around for a couple of hours  we picked up some fun souvenirs for ourselves and loved ones amp x200b from the flea market we walked to  rengeoin sanjusangendo  which is an astonishing hall filled with 1001 statues of kannon  i feel like i should note that this is the point where my husband started getting the dreaded shrine temple fatigue  i personally never experienced it  and i honestly think he lasted longer than most would amp x200b we then headed toward kiyomizudera  i ll be honest  we weren t 100  sold on visiting kiyomizudera this trip  just because of the sheer amount of construction  we decided to wander up that direction anyway  we stopped inside the  studio ghibli store  on the way  which is definitely a must do if you re a fan amp x200b long story short  we didn t end up at kiyomizudera  at this point in the trip  we had alreadyitted toing back to japan some time in the next three years  and we thought it would be better to wait until it wasn t covered in scaffolding amp x200b our decision not to stop at kiyomizudera freed up some room in our itinerary  so we said  why not  and took the bus to  ginkakuji  the silver pavilion  i m glad i didn t go to kinkakuji first or this would have been really disappointing  i kept looking for the  silver pavilion  only to realize that the very not silver building i was looking at was it  i know some research would have solved this  but it wasn t really even on my radar  it s still a  beautiful area  especially with the  fall colors  also  the incense they sell here smells amazing amp x200b we then walked the  philosopher s path  to  eikando temple  for autumn illuminations  word to the wise  there is very little to eat along the philosopher s path  we were starving and couldn t even find a convenience store to satiate ourselves  otherwise  the philosopher s path was a delightful little walk  especially as  the sun began to set  bonus  lots of  friendly stray cats amp x200b we arrived at  eikando temple  right before the gates opened for autumn illuminations  there were easily over a thousand people ahead of us in line  thanks  tour buses  but once the gates opened  we were in within 20 minutes  eikando temple is considered  the  destination for fall colors  and  i can see why  but i think if i had to choose between eikando and daigoji  i d choose daigoji every time  maybe i m just salty because i found it hard to take a  good picture  here  that being said  if you have time for both  do both amp x200b after eikando  we traveled back to our house  stopping at a cute little ramen place close by called  shikura  this place was awesome  cheap  no frills  super flavorful  highly rend if you re by kinkakuji amp x200b part 2 in theents ,1

where to do easy outdoor activities without sleeping in a tent ,my girlfriend and i are going to japan in may and are currently planning the trip  which will include lots of city and some nature  i m very much the outdoor type and she s not so much  therefore we try to find some  somewhat  easy nature stuff that doesn t require sleeping in a tent  but still present some beautiful nature and a slow pace i m looking for something like maybe a small route to walk where we could sleep in two three different resorts located somewhere in nature  or maybe better with just one place and do some trips out from that place  rent some bikes  take a ski lift to the top of some peak or something  it needs to be easy or she won t enjoy it  we are not packing to hike  so minimal hiking  more just strolling around  doing other nature stuff  some kind of nature  outdoor activity resort area i m walking a hair fine balance with this because i know she ll love it if it s not too strenuous but i also don t want places that are too touristy  that means that places like the sagano bamboo forest  which i m still looking forward to see  doesn t count cause it s a too civilized  i would like to get away from the crowds the overall plan is to start in tokyo for some days  then move towards fuji and then kyoto  lastly back to tokyo  not breaking too much from this route would be preferable if anyone has any tips for me  that would be awesome  i ll post whatever i figure out in this thread in case anyone else is interested in finding such places ,1

first time traveler with lots of questions,hi  i ve been wanted to travel to japan for more than 15 years now  and i ve been saving money for 5 years for that trip   my dream will finallye true  as i  27 yo  plan to travel for  20days in november with my parents from france  they don t know yet  but as a surprise i will pay for almost the whole trip with a budget of 7000   7641usd  since this is quite a huge amount  this stresses me out and i have a bunch of questions 1  first  open jaw tickets seem to me as a good idea  e g  arriving at tokyo  leaving at osaka  but when i look at suggested itineraries  it s not quiteon  any particular reasons   is it more expensive  2  for a total immersion  i would like to try different types of aodation  e g  ryokan  shukubo  temple lodgings  capsule hotel  only for one night  mixed with more classical ones  airbnb  hotels  in order to save some money  this implies moving a lot with our luggage  and since my mother doesn t know how to travel light i m very concerned about it  we will probably use some luggage delivery service  e g  takkyubin  but what about capsule hotels for example  do they have locker large enough for big luggage  3  in order to reduce our luggage size  and or keep some space for souvenirs  i m planning to do laundry in hotels or going to off site laundromat  is it effective and convenient   i ve read some good and some bad feedback  it seems  to me that walking 10 min with my clothes  waiting for an hour then walking back is kinda killing the mood 4  in case of open jaw tickets  should we arrive at tokyo and leave at osaka or the opposite   i ve heard autumn leaves are beautiful at kyoto and i wouldn t like to miss the autumn colors at their peak   approx  date are november 8   november 28  it seems that november 21 is the color peak in kyoto 5  i m planning to buy  cheap  large luggage in japan for the souvenirs  any advice would be appreciated  6  my mother would like to see mount fuji  some geisha  and traditional japan  my father is more interested in modern japan  also  my father and me are food lovers  who said osaka    d  any itinerary advice to please everyone   i mainly want to see tokyo  osaka  nara  kyoto  e g  kinkaju ji temple  bamboos forest  kimono forest  dotonbori  umeda  teamlab borderless  ghibli   7  i would love to do some onsen but being naked next to my father is something ufortable for me  and i don t want private onsen that look like a pool  am i doomed  8  apart from the november tournament at fukuoka kokusai center  which is far from our travel location  are there some other sumo show off to attend  let s stop this there  i will certainlye back to you later ha ha  thanks for reading me and thanks in advance for your responses ,1

3 week japan trip  end of dec 2019   early jan 2020  report, brief summary  arrived to narita on the 21st dec 2019 and left on the 11th jan 2020  we stayed in tokyo  shirakawago  shin hotaka  takayama  sendai  fukushima  naoshima and hiroshima  i have travelled to japan many times before but it was my partner s first time  snow season started late this time so we didn t see snow in a few places that we expected to but we still had pretty good experience with heavy snow falls in other places  partner isn t interested in temples and shrines and i ve seen enough so we only went to a few small ones on our way    we did a lot of shopping and also had a few lazy days when we could sleep in and only have 1 or 2 plans for the day  i did a 2 years japanese language course and spoke a little so it wasn t too bad travelling around    when we were planning the trip  my relatives from vietnam were planning toe to tokyo during this period too  that s why i decided to stay in tokyo for 4 nights before we headed down south so i could hang out with them  unfortunately  my relatives cancelled their trip last minute and we couldn t be bothered changing our itinerary anymore some tips  since we travelled between cities a lot  we decided to just stay in hotels near the stations rather than airbnbs  that also means we didn t need to pack our pyjamas and some toiletry stuff  most hotels alsoe with massage chairs for ¥200 300 15 mins  one hotel offered free massage chair in theon area  we stayed in shinagawa for most of the time in tokyo since it s also one of the main shinkansen stops  for the night before our departure day  we stayed in oosaki  where we could easily find a bus to narita airport for ¥1 000 per person  took the bus from narita to shinagawa  chucked all our suitcases in the bus  had a good nap without worries and the bus arrived at right in front of our hotel  shopping at this time was amazing  most things were 40 60  off for end of the yeanew year sale    can t trust google on opening and closing hours during the new year holiday  do check the stores  restaurants  websites or social media to be sure  make sure to do some research for special bus packages if you visit takayama and the alps  sendai is such a good place for shopping without the crowds and impolite chinese tourists  most hotels provided umbrellas when it s snowing or raining  we used our debit card which doesn t have any hidden fees so withdrawing cash or paying by card was so easy  it was also convenient using our suica cards at conbinis or vending machines       details day 1  tokyo arrive around 9am and pick our sim card up at the airport post office  took bus to shinagawa  left luggage at the hotel and went to the station to take care of jr pass and reserve shinkansen tickets after lunch we headed to yayoi kusama museum  tickets were reserved online for the 3pm session headed to shinjuku central afterward to exchange money and had some drinks at a small local bar in an old and depressing building  nice cocktails and good selection of japanese whiskey for reasonable prices  went to winter illumination nearby in shinjuku before heading back to our hotel   day2  tokyo got up early and head to aomi station in odaiba for teamlab borderless at 10am  the queue was quite long when we got there  spent 3 hours there and then proceeded to teamlab planet  we got tickets for the 1 30pm session  lunch at the food stall at teamlab planets  spent about 1 5 hour there  went to divercity for the giant gundam figure and headed to yurakucho station to meet a friend for dinner went to shibuya to see another friend at tsutaya  had dessert and drinks at the cafe on the 7th floor  nice vibe  went to tower records and the don quijote to get some stuff for winter  heated foot pads  gel  eyemasks  foot masks  etc day 3  shirakawago took the train from shinagawa station in the morning arrived to toyama and got bus tickets to shirakawago  arrived around 1 20pm  it wasn t snowing there at all  we left the luggage at shirakawago no yu ryokan and went to get lunch and walked around town  the weather was pleasant  it wasn t as cold as we expected  we took a pleasant walk to the observatory and back to the village around 4pm took a bath at the onsen after we got back from our walk  it was less crowded then  i ve been to this hotel before and realised they lifted the tattoo ban in the onsen  we did another evening walk after dinner and returned early to rest day 4  shinhotaka left shirakawago at 10 20am to takayama  got the okuhida marugoto 3 days value tickets  leave for okuhida on the 11 40am bus  started seeing a lot of snow on the way  got to shinhotaka ropeway bus stop around 1 30pm  left luggage at hotel hotaka and went to ropeway terminal to have lunch at the restaurant there  the food wasn t bad at all  the mountain was covered in snow so it was quite nice for a walk before we checked in  we decided before the trip to spend a quiet and peaceful christmas in the mountain and rest up after all the travelling so we booked a room for 2 nights here  the rate is aud720 for a room with views for 2 nights including breakfasts and dinners  the onsen was top notch  clean and well taken care of  i tried to go early before dinner and i had the whole female bath for myself  the outdoor onsen was beautiful with mountains covered in snow views and their amenity was excellent  dinner was delightful with so many local dishes  a staff dressed in santa claus outfit went around the tables giving out small packs of christmas treats as presents  there wasn t much to do around  my partner went to the onsen while i spent time on the massage chair  we bought some beer and enjoyed a slow and quiet christmas s eve in front of the fireplace at the lounge   day 5  shinhotaka  okuhida woke up with the view of the mountain covered in thick snow and a peak of the alps  went back to bed after breakfast because we were lazy  took the bus to hiruya onsen and had lunch at a restaurant near the bus terminal  walked around town  had some onsen eggs  did some souvenirs shopping and bought some beer at a convenient store  it s way cheaper than getting anything from shinhotaka ropeway as there were no convenient stores nearby  we just enjoyed the snow and played with some shiba inus on the streets lol  had cake in a cafe near the bus stop and got back to shinhotaka ropeway terminal around 4 30pm  more relaxing time at the onsen dinner at the hotel and went to star gazing at 9pm  this was organised by the hotel   day 6  shinhotaka   takayama went to shinhotaka ropeway in the morning  it was very cloudy and misty  we couldn t see the alps at the lookout but it was snowing quite heavily and we went for a walk at the park outside the ropeway station  had lunch at the ropeway station took the bus to takayama around 2pm and got to the city around 3 45pm  checked in at the hotel and went to a late lunch early dinner at a place called kyouya  lucky we went early as you need a reservation for dinner  the food was good  we had more hida beef yakiniku and tried some local beer  the owner and staff were very friendly and chatty  went back to the main shopping district and walked around after dinner  went to the hotel s public bath and around 10pm we felt a bit hungry  it was raining at the time but we decided to go to dekonaru yokocho for supper  it was 7 mins walk from the hotel we settled in an oden place which satfortably 8 customers at a time  there was english menu and the owner spoke english just fine  she used to study english in melbourne  aus  and we had a lot to share about the city  some young customers were interested and tried to speak english to us too  the owner also tried to make us feel included in every conversation with other local customers  we had a lot to drink and left when it was almost 1am    day 7  takayama had a bit of a hangover in the morning so we slept in  went to a place called ryu ryu for lunch  ordered hida beef ramen and it was so good  i decided to do a little food tour around takayama old town  went to pudding tei and tried their snow pudding which was good too  had hida beef gyuman  hida beef croquette  pumpkin cheesecake  hida beef sushi  dango and sake tasting went to the showa museum and it was so much fun  especially since i was exposed to japanese media culture since the 80s 90s  it was snowing very heavily in takayama   and the old town was flooded with so many tourists  shops started to close around 5pm  we went back to our hotel for a bath and went to a sushi bar in dekonaru for dinner around 10 30pm  the sushi bar sat about 8 people max  sushi chef spoke fluent english and showed us an english menu  we ordered the premium set and it was delicious  chef wasn t very chatty but he was really attentive and polite  the food was great for 2 people for 50aud   day 8  sendai took the train at 11am to toyama  from toyama took another train to omiya and then to sendai  went to the shopping centre next to sendai station to find food but ended up doing a lot of shopping  there are a lot of good japanese brands and brands from europe  shopping was a lot easier in sendai since it doesn t seem to be a big tourist spot or popular with chinese tourists  had pizza for dinner and it was really good  went to the arcade and spent an hour or more there  met up with a friend from sendai for a drink in aoba   day 9  sendai took the train to matsushima in the afternoon because we were dead tired from the day before and decided to sleep in went to have  all you can eat  oysters  ¥2000 for 40 mins  and it was good fun  i was so bad at opening up the shells and the japanese girl sitting across me must have felt bad watching me  she signalled me to follow how she did and i master the art of eating oysters lol  after 30 mins i already got sick of oysters and thought i would never wanna eat oysters again for at least a month or two visited the date masamune museum  it was a nice sunny day but the wind at the bay was quite chilly  we wanted to take the ferry around the bay but we got lazy and wanna walk around town instead we tried some other local snacks like the huge rice cracker and fish cake  got back to sendai and did more shopping  so much better than shopping in tokyo or osaka since there were like 85  less crowded  we found some vintage stores too with so many items in good quality  stumbled upon a hedgehog cafe late yakiniku dinner near our hotel  sendai beef was so good too  i only knew about sendai gyutan before this trip and was pleasantly surprised about how good sendai wagyu was   day 10  sendai we slept in again  queued up for almost 50 mins for gyutan at a popular place right next to our hotel  went to aoba castle area did more shopping  went back to the yakiniku near our hotel since most restaurants are fully booked  the owner recognised me from the night before and i wrote a good review for them on google and he gave us free dessert as a treat   day 11  aizu miyashita  fukushima we went to the station early for breakfast  then took the 10 40am train to fukushima and arrived at aizu miyashita around 2 30pm  our train from koriyama arrived later than the schedule and we almost missed the tadami train from aizu wakamatsu  train only came once every hour so the staff actually waited for people to board the train views from tadami train were lovely  it started snowing heavily on our way to aizu miyashita too my friend in japan helped me to book a guest house which is less than 5 mins from the station  it was a small guesthouse with 3 4 rooms and ran by one old lady  she single handedly prepared all breakfasts and dinners and also tried to use a japanese   english translator tounicate with guests it was snowing really heavily so we only did a short walk to the triple arch bridges  the town was so quiet  the only conbini opens until 7pm by an elder man  we stocked up as many drinks and snacks as it was the last day of the year and everywhere else would be closed for new year we had dinner at the guesthouses with other guests and exchanged our stories  the owner lady prepared dishes that japanese always have for new year  there was a fireplace in the dining room and we just relaxed there drinking beer while watching gaki no tsukai we wanted a quiet new year and that was it  in a town that the majority of the population is elderly  most shops and restaurants were closed for the new year holiday  guess what we did for our new year s eve  watching nhk kohaku uta gassen and other gameshows on tv lol   day 12  aizu miyashita  fukushima we had a late breakfast and walked to the nearest shrine  snow started melting then  then we took a walk to the famous viewpoint of the tadami river s bridge  took almost 50 mins since the roads were covered with snow and ice  by the time we reached the viewpoints  the next train wasing in an hour or so  we basically just sat around waiting for the train to pass  had some good views of the bridge but snow already melted a lot and it was quite windy so the water wasn t very still walked back to town and went to check out the onsen in a ryokan nearby  went to another viewpoint for another train passing by  this viewpoint is only 20 mins walk from the guest house so it was easy to get there we went back to our guesthouse and it started snowing again  had dinner and rested up early since we were taking an early train the next day day 13  tokyo breakfast at 7am and we took the 9am train back to tokyo got to shinagawa around 2pm and checked in to our hotel  had a quick lunch in ebisu and walked around ebisu before going to roppongi hills for mori art museum  the queue was a bit long since it was public holiday  we spent about 2 hours there and took a walk around roppongi hills had dinner in an udon restaurant in roppongi went back to the hotel early and had couple of drinks in a bar near the station day 14  tokyo i wanted to take my partner to meiji jingu  i don t feel bad if hees to japan and not visited any of the major attractions but by the time we got to harajuku station  it was flooded with people going to meiji jingu  it was so crowded it probably would take up 30 mins to move for 100 metres  so yeah  screw it we went shopping we spent the whole day from harajuku to omotesando and then aoyama then back to harajuku  motsunabe for dinner  well  my partner can t eat this so he ordered something else and i was craving for motsunabe since i was in sendai  however  most restaurants required at least 2 people for the dish and i couldn t order motsunabe for one and i ended up finishing the whole pot for 2  i wanted to check out some clubs in tokyo but walking the whole day for shopping wore us out so much we ended up going back to the hotel to rest   day 15  tokyo headed to harajuku again because some shops were closed on the previous days  if you are interested in japanese designer brands  check out studious stores in harajuku   went to shimokitazawa for vintage clothings and had a couple of drinks in a bar there went to shinjuku to exchange for more cash and showed my partner kabukicho at night went to ebisu so i can have afuri ramen  it s always my favourite ramen chain in tokyo day 16  naoshima from shinagawa we took the 8am train to uno station arrived at naoshima around 2pm we rented a bike and left our suitcases at the bike shop  our luggage was delivered to the hotel by the bike shop staff  went to chichu art museum and had lunch there  went to the yellow pumpkin and then benness house  cycled to our hotel which is nearer to honmura area  the italian restaurant attached to the hotel was actually really good  the pizzas were delicious and the dessert was beautiful day 17  inujima and teshima took the 9 20am ferry from naoshima to inujima  visited seirensho art museum walked around the island for the  art house project  and the dog statue had lunch at ticket center cafe i quite enjoyed inujima  there aren t many artworks on the island but every single one of them was memorable  the island population is only 50 70 people and majority of them are over 50 60 years old  we met some local who were very friendly to tourists  i m glad this art project was done in this island and attracting more visitors  it felt very tranquil there got to teshima around 1 35pm  from the port we did a short walk to yokoo house  we walked back to the port and took the bus to teshima art museum  the architecture was impressive  we took the bus back to the port and got back to naoshima around 4 40pm  went to naoshima famous public bath house  i love yu  got back to the hotel and went to the nearby okonomiyaki restaurant for dinner  food was delicious   day 18  naoshima   okayama   onomichi in the morning we walked to honmura for naoshima art house project  personally i like every single art house project we visited that day  the staff was very attentive and informative and that helped us to understand the art works better   visited ando museum  it s a small building showcasing most of his works on the island and nearby islands  for someone who wasn t familiar with him before  it was a good to visit the museum after actually seeing his works in person  we walked back to the hotel and called for a cab to the port  left naoshima around noon my partner wanted to get some jeans from momotaro jeans but we couldn t find his size in tokyo  we decided to stop by okayama and went to the flagship store there  we walked around the main shopping district near okayama station and had lunch there arrived to onomichi around 4pm walked around the town centre and ended up having dinner in a modern looking restaurant that opens till late  we had different kamameshi sets with some drinks  hiroshima lemon cocktails were so delicious day 19  onomichi the weather was terrible  it was raining heavily since the morning and was very windy  we went to onomichi museum of art in the morning  another building by tadao ando  it s smaller than we expected  we walked around the area for half an hour and ended up having lunch at the cafe nearby i also got to try my favourite yamaneko pudding near the station despite the weather  we decided to follow our itinerary and visited okunoshima in the afternoon  we got to the island around 2 30pm  had fun watching and feeding the rabbits and the poison gas museum  we didn t actually read about the museum s existence so it was quite interesting to see a dark past of japan on an island full of wild rabbits we got back to tadanoumi port around 4pm  i saw on google map there was princess kaguya museum nearby so we took a walk there  it was a small old building but it was cute seeing all little details about the folklore  arrived to onomichi around 7pm and i had onomichi ramen in the shopping district while my partner opted for pizza in another italian place and it was surprisingly so good  for such a small town  there are quite many italian restaurants onomichi is really a quiet town  shops open late and close early  i wonder how they do business there  it didn t look like there were many tourists either  when i first came to japan 5 years ago  my friend and i accidentally booked a hostel in onomichi instead of hiroshima center  we only stayed for 1 night but i had a good impression of the town and its people  that s why i decided toe back to visit  well  that s not entirely true  another factor was that i m a big fan of the yakuza game franchise and onomichi was one of the main locations featured in yakuza 6 and i would love to visit and walk through the paths in the game  it was fascinating to see how students taking the train back to onomichi then waited for the ferry to return to their homes on another island  i remember taking a 15 mins direct bus to school back in highschool and i was often late or lazy to go to school then  onomichi is a really small city with not a lot to do to be honest  there were some new trendy looking cafes popping up  good food and it made me feel like i could actually slow down and relax there  will ie back  definitely  and next time i would rent a bike and do the biking trails   day 20  miyajima and hiroshima we visited miyajima in the morning  got to the island around 10 40am i already read about the torii is currently under renovation but my main objective here is to try the oysters on miyajima  and i thought i already got sick of oysters from matsushima  how wrong i was  headed straight to kakiya honten for an early lunch and to beat the crowd too  got a special set with lemon beer  it was so satisfying we walked to daishoin temple and itsukushima shrine  i got attacked by deers   they tried to eat my paper map and my coat  tried oyster bun and more oyster snacks on the way back to the port we got to hiroshima around 2pm  took my partner to peace memorial museum and even though i had been there 3 times  i still got so emotional  we took a walk to the park and the atomic bomb dome we checked out the shopping district and had hiroshima okonomiyaki for dinner returned to onomichi around 10pm day 21  tokyo we were supposed to take the 9 30am train to leave onomichi and we got to the station almost 20 mins early  and then we took the wrong train lol  neither of us realised that we took the train from the wrong platform even though i checked my tickets several times  brain fart moment there we were desperate to take the train back at the next stop but guess what  every stop on from that train line is 12 15 mins apart from each other  by the time we arrived at the next stop  we were already late for our train  we still managed to rebook our tickets at fukuyama jr station and ended up arriving at tokyo around 4pm we returned to harajuku because i wanted to get some coat from a shop there  unfortunately the coat was sold out and the only place that had it in stock is in takashimaya shinjuku  we went to shibuya to get some basketball cards for our friend and then headed to shinjuku for last day shopping  apparently there was a 50  off for the coat i love after i left tokyo earlier  so instead of buying 1 coat  i ended up getting 2 different ones   we went to don quijote for some souvenir shopping and bought a small suitcase  returned to our hotel in oosaki and started packing  day 22  last day in tokyo our flight was at 7 30pm so we had the whole morning hanging around the ginza for window shopping had my favourite chirashi don for lunch in a sushi restaurant while my partner opted for wagyu burger in another place  ginza dover street market  amp  ginza 6 were such a temptation since almost everything was on sale  we got back to our hotel around 3 30pm  picked up the suitcases from the hotel staff and took a 5 mins walk to the airport bus stop  we got tickets for 4pm bus and arrived at the airport around 5 30pm more souvenir shopping at the airport and i had some ramen as my last meal  surprisingly it was quite decent  not the best ramen but definitely the best airport meal i have had   some photos from the trip part 1 part 2 part 3 ,1
the best ramen spots in tokyo if you don t speak japanese ,my partner and i are visiting tokyo in july 2020 for the first time and we re really excited to partake in the thriving ramen culture  however  neither of us speak japanese and i ve read online that some spots aren t very patient with foreigners  though i don t know how true that is  my partner can also be pretty fussy with what she eats so reddit  where would you rend  we re craving some amazing ramen  arigato ,1
question about kawazu sakura forecast,so  i know that the cherry blossom festival in kawazu starts in early february and ends in early march  but i ve been seeing reports of the sakura being in full bloom much earlier this year i was planning to attend the festival on march 1  is there a forecast as to when the blossoms will be gone  will i be too late ,1
being late to a baseball game  ,hi all i posted this in another sub but i haven t received a response  can someone tell me the time etiquette for baseball games   the game starts at 6pm but i don t think i can be there until 7pm  would this be a problem   thanks ,1
question regarding different train lines,quick question   if i am using a jr pass and my son is not   for day trips out of osaka  will he be using different trains than me   unless i am mistaken  some of the kansai regional passes don t include jr    he will only be joining me on some days  kyoto  nara  kobe and possibly hiroshima  so while a 21 day jr pass  totally pays for itself in my case as i am planning on onomichi  koyasan and kurashiki too  it won t make sense for him  thanks ,1
gender seats on bus,definitely a male cannot take a female seat  but could a female book a male seat if she wishes to seat beside by her malepanion ,1
first time to japan  two days outside of tokyo  hakone  kusatsu  or ikaho ,my partner and i will be visiting japan for the first time this spring  we ll be in kyoto just before golden week  planning to stay in tokyo during golden week  and then we ll have about 2 5 days before we fly out of haneda  we re thinking that the last few days would be a good time to visit an onsen town   we figure they should be less crowded after the holidays  we ve narrowed it down to hakone  kusatsu  or ikaho  our main goals are really just to experience the onsen and relax  a little sightseeing  maybe a light hike  ie flat and well marked paths  but not much more than that  we d like to stay at a ryokan which should be possible at any of the three between the three  what are the pros cons of each here s what i can see so far hakone pros  easy to reach from tokyo  seems to be the largest  or at least best known  of the three  probably caters the most to visitors cons  may still be crowded  may be overly touristy kusatsu pros  looks like the prettiest option  cons  farthest to get to   maybe too far for a two day  one night trip ikaho pros  the staircase looks awesome  the silver vs golden onsen look awesome  and it would be nice to see a historical city that isn t tokyo or kyoto  cons  also a little hard to get to  a little worried it s  too  far off the beaten path for a pair of american tourists with less than 100 words of japanese between them ,1
itinerary check  october 25   nov 14  tokyo   kyoto osaka   kiso valley    nikko   tokyo ,hey there  my partner and i are traveling to japan october 25th   nov 14th  this is my 3rd time  partner s 2nd

narita 12pm  do all our necessities  get   pocket wifi s  jr pass  hop on shinkansen to ikebukuro  where we will be staying  grab some food if we arrive before check in  conveniently our hotel around the corner from ichiran ramen  which was one of our favorites from our last trip  probably rest and grab dinner nearby  sleeeeps day 2   10 26 we ve got a few ideas for the next couple of days  but flexible on which order to do them in wake up get some breakfast  and maybe some snacks at konbini  i ve heard good things about sunshine city  amp  aquarium  which i imagine we could spend at least half a day there depending on our friend s work schedule  probably meet up with him in asakusa for dinner  if he s free doesn t work next day  we might go do karaoke until the trains start running in the am   day 3   10 27 maybe hit up nakano broadway  i imagine this taking up a full day  since our last trip we underestimated how amazing this place was  finish the day by going to the jojo s bizarre adventure bar my other shopping list is vintage clothing  ideally 1940s 1980s era women s or men s styles  i ve heard shimokitazawa and k enji are the places to hit  currently interested in visiting stickout  700 yen shop  and shimokita garage department  any other favorites in the area partner is really interested in shibuya  figure we should see the goodest boy  hachiko statue and the crossing  other than that and some shops  i figure we could adventure around here until we get touristed out day 4   10 28 this is open for pretty much any of the above we haven t done yet and or open for suggestions  we re into anime  kurosawa movies  vintage retro clothing and video gaming  music  jazz  metal  classical  fooooood  art exhibits museums  arcades  rare finds and lesser known spots  samurai day 5   10 29   kyoto check out of airbnb  grab some breakfast  and maybe send our luggage via yamato  take shinkansen to kyoto  check into airbnb  depending on time how we re feeling  go out and adventure day 6   10 30 probably rest a bit  take first half of the day easy  grab food and check out nearby sites  our airbnb is very close to fushimi inari so likely could check that out early am or in the evening  ideally avoid large crowds times  possibly check out some shopping streets   teramachi  we have a friend who works there that we want to stop and say hi to  there was also a few fabric shops i wanted to visit visit kinse cafe in the evening if we can  we stayed here last trip and fell in love  yamato  their neighborhood cat  is the best day 7   10 31 halloween maybe dress up that evening if we were able to pack a costume or find one during our travels  is there any events or places to go in kyoto for halloween  or is it mostly celebrated in osaka  we re both fairly flexible on where to go  but i wouldn t mind spending it in a more lively setting  i ve seen mention of triangle park and a few other spots in osaka might try and end up at space station video game bar at some point in the night day 8   11 1 i imagine we will be out late so probably plan to rest and sleep in open to suggestions on kyoto spots  my first trip i went with an exchange program and visited just about every temple in the area  so i don t have a huge urge to visit many  we ve seen kiyomisudera  but want to check out that surrounding area again  we also did nara park last trip  but had a rather disappointing time  any other must see temples or spots spots that have peaked my interest saiho ji   akame 48 waterfalls  nishiki market  arashiyama  koyasan  samurai ninja museum day 9   11 2 open day  do some laundry  open to suggestions day 10   11 3   11 7   kiso valley   magome tsumago  tentative this is the part of our trip i am a bit nervous about  i ve always loved the idea of staying here  but also wonder if there is another spot we should try instead just do a day trip into kiso valley  we really want to hike magome   tsumago  but not sure how many days to stay in the area otherwise  it seems absolutely beautiful and tranquil  but also a bit tricky to travel around find affordable spots to stay   might just be overthinking it we arepletely relying on public transit  trains  or cabs  we also wouldn t want to bring all our luggage  so ideally find a spot to leave our larger suitcase for 5 7 days  would love to know tips on staying here  best towns to stay in  ena  nakatsugawa  ina  others  aodation rendations  must see spots if not kiso   any other spots we could make home base that would fit with our current itinerary  i ve vaguely looked into the following  toyama  kanazawa  takayama  kurobe  gifu seki  yamanashi also willing to consider apletely new spot  but probably wouldn t want to leave honshu this trip day 14   11 7   nikko take train to asakusa station  get all day pass for nikko  unless nikko pass can be obtained earlier  travel to nikkocheck into airbnb  checkout nearby sights  food  etc day 15   11 8 our current plan  take bus walk to shinkyo bridge  hike to toshogu shrine  then if still up for it  visit shoyo en garden seem doable in one day my other interest was kegon falls  but it seems a bit far out there  very open to other amazing spots in nikko day 16   11 9   tokyo check out  take train back to shinjuku shibuya asakusa ikebukuro shimokitazawa  still deciding on where to stay  we stayed in shinjuku last trip  which was awesome  but open to trying somewhere new  our friend lives in asakusa  so that seemed like a fun spot to be but open to suggestions  partner likes the idea of staying in shibuya  i like shimokitazawa  since it ll be a bit outside of the madness of shibuya  while still being easily accessible to all locations  and it s near thrift shops      day 17   day 20 these will be flexible days to cover anything we missed on first tokyo leg  also will be dependent on where we end up staying  will update as we finalize our plans a bit more we did miyazaki museum  akihabara  shinjuku  and teamlab  borderless our last trip few rough ideas in mind  nintendo world  suginami animation museum  evangelion world  wanariya aizome dyeing  fuji five lakes day trip  odaiba  we didn t stay long after

why would people use  wee suica ,i just found out that jr east came up with the concept of  wee suica  and i wondered what the draw would be for that  if any   apparently posters in this subreddit have used it the main selling point is the lack of the 500 yen deposit  but the card automatically deactivates after 28 days  taking all remaining balance with it  so basically if you leave the country with more than 500 yen on the card  it is more expensive  if you have  too much  you ll probably have to randomly shop around just to get rid of the credit while the regular card will  cost  you 500 yen  you can still reuse it on your next trip and you have the peace of mind that  if you put too much  you can still get a refund  so the  wee  card sounds like a sour deal but maybe that s just me  is the 500 yen deposit really that much of a dealbreaker to people ,1

hakone   high winds and construction closures,i m going to hakone tomorrow and trying to plan our trip  and i m seeing a lot of closures due to both constructions and high wind i m trying to understand the effect it will have on our trip and i have to admit  hakone confuses me 1  it looks like both the  hakone tozan line and the cable car  are suspended at this point due to the typhoon  what impact does this have on travel time and overall experience  scenery etc  2  they are expecting high winds tomorrow  and when i checked this afternoon the ropeway to owakudani was closed  is there any other way to get to owakudani if the ropeway is closed  if not  is it even worth going to souzan  what route should we take to do the typically hakone loop amp x200b thank youupdate  for anyone reading this and having the same questions  when we looked at 9 the rope way was opened  by the time we got to odawara they told us it had closed and asked if we still want to do the free pass  i asked what other choice we had and she said pay as you go which is expensive and confusing  she asked if i was staying overnight and i said yes  she told me that if tuesday morning it was still closed to go back to see them at odawara and they would give us a partial refund on the free pass  we took the t bus from odawara straight to our hotel  north of gora  dropped off our luggage and when to togendai where the bottom of the rope way and the cruises are  by the time we got there the rope way was opened  we did a round trip to the top  and then the cruise ship to hakone  however the wind picked up and they closed both the rope way and the cruise ship  tldr  the rope way cruise can open and close throughout the day  might be able to get a partial refund if they are closed the whole time you are in hakone ,1

approached by three young ladies that want to show us how to pray on thursday ,hi everyone  so my husband and i were approached by three young women while walking back to the jr station gate in ikebukuro  they started a conversation with us and we re talking pretty good english  it was great we could have a conversation with the locals there  it s just  from where wee from it s skeptical to trust strangers   so when they asked us if they could show us how to pray at a temple we felt a bit uneasy  but we scheduled it anyway for thursday around 7pm  they handed us a flyer with information and exchanged social media with us  then we went separate ways  i looked into the place they want to take us and it seems to be more of a religious school than a temple  though i m still not sure  the place they want to take us is     in saitama japan  kinda far from where we currently are the three women seemed really nice  and i feel bad for thinking they might deceive us  but like i said it s hard to trust strangers has this happened to anyone else before  is this safe  how often so locals do this kind of thing with foreign tourists  thank you so much  we ve been loving our trip here so far edit  thanks everyone  i tried searching the sub about strangers but just got the usual  itinerary advice  perhaps i didn t search right  still pretty new to this  also i ve read posts earlier these few months saying how people encountered strangers in japan and had a good time  so o wanted to ask if anyone had a similar situation  thank you again ,1

half day at disney sea,hi  i ve got the whole intinerary for me and my sister s trip to japan in april  but i have a doubt about disney sea  we are both quite big disney fans and due to scheduling issues  not enough days tbh  we can only attend disney sea the day we return to tokyo from osaka  which means we would probably get to the park around 1pm  i ve checked and  apparently  that day the park closes at 10 so i m wondering  what should i expect  i imagine i won t be able to get fast passes as they don t have the app to get them beforehand  but will the rides be open that late how many people actually are there  we don t mind missing repeat rides if absolutely necessary  we ve been to both disneyland and disney world  but wouldn t wanna be unable to do anything either thanks ,1
looking for karaoke in osaka as non japanese speaker,preferably under 5000 yen per person please thanks  tried to go to random one in tokyo but the front desk doesn t speak english ,1

trips report  aomori  saga  fukui   amp  tokushima,four amazing places i was fortunate enough to visit last year and early this year  never got around to writing them up sadly aomori  is the northernmost prefecture on honshu  just below the tsugaru strait that divides the mainland from hokkaido  it s not often visited  10th least visited prefecture  which is a shame  this is the place to go for anyone who wants to see some beautiful nature  fresh air and uncrowded streets we stayed in  aomori city  which is a reasonablypact downtown area with ample attractions walking distance from the station  the main street has covered pedestrian walkways on either side  and a lot of unique  smaller stores  there s some good bars and restaurants  and hotels are fairly cheap and walking distance to the station aomori has a spectacular festival every summer  nebuta festival  there s similar ones all over the north  but aomori s is the biggest and most extravagant  if you can t be there for it  the wa rasse museum has extremely detailed exhibits  including previous floats and musical instruments  every hour or two  staffe out and teach people how to use them  which was absolutely thrilling  the entire place has a very festive feel to it nearby is the a center  which is a shopping mall for all things aomori  including every manner of apple product  the region is famous for them  past that  there s an old retired ferry that used to run the strait before the tunnel was built  it s a museum ship  you can wander around inside and see everything from the bridge to the engine room  there s a fairly nice aquarium  and a 20 minute bus ride will get you to the prehistoric yayoi village  an archaeological site featuring reconstructed buildings reminiscent of what they ve dug up  several in situ exhibits are also presented  and the attached museum building is very detailed  there are free tours but only in japanese  you don t really need the tour  5 minute walk away  there s a very interesting modern art museum with a giant dog statue hirosaki  is nearby  and has a museum dedicated to  their  festival  the neputa festival  not a typo  this one is also very well put together  and has floats  music  old time toys  a garden  and arts and crafts  really sort of a potpourri of things lol  they also had some information on the various nebuta neputa festivals all around tohoku  we loved it  and it s right across from hirosaki castle park  which has a beautiful  but small  castle amp x200b down to the other end of the country   saga  prefecture was an absolute gem  saga city itself has everything you d want need from a larger city  but with a much more relaxed vibe  i stayed there for two days to visit a multimedia event at saga prefectural building  which often has such events  i also visited the yayoi archaeological site there  too  it s very large  they have a bus to shuttle you from one end to the other  but it s immensely detailed and the reconstructions are impressive  you can climb a guard tower  go in a chief s house  it s very interactive  they also have in situ exhibits  including a unique burial method not found elsewhere  the dead were buried in cocoon type containers  in very specific poses  which were then piled geometrically into massive mounds  they actually excavated one and you can go inside and see many graves from there  i visited  imari  and region  this is the capital of porcelain for all japan  and it shows  the downtown is decorated with porcelain everywhere  even the sidewalks are crushed porcelain mixed in with some hardener  of course you can buy it around there  or in neighboring  okawachiyama  village  20 minutes away by bus from the station   last bus returns at like 4pm  okawachiyama was  still is really  a hidden village where pottery was controlled by the ruling clan  even the imperial pottery was made here  and it s literally still a working pottery village  like 30 different active kilns  many of them have stores attached  prices range from bargains to obscenely expensive  so search around  also don t leave your pokemon at any go gyms here or you ll literally be waiting 3 weeks to get it back  just saying another nearby pottery town is  arita  while i did like okawachiyama better  arita has an amazing offer  one of the kilns  which has been in business for like 200 years  has a massive warehouse of slightly non perfect porcelain they ve accumulated  for either 5000 or 10000 yen   50 100 dollars  you get a flashlight and basket  and whatever you fill up you can take home  you never know what you ll find  i didn t make it a quarter of the way across the area  and unless you re an expert  you won t see the difference between those and the full price stuff  majorly good haul  the manager speaks like 8 languages  super nice guy  and they can ship your box home of you want  treasure hunting was so much fun dining in imari was quite nice  i stayed at a beautiful house out in the country with an adorable cat  guest house ne doco  so most meals were included but i managed to eat lunch at the top restaurant in all of kyushu  drive in tori   the number 1 set was amazing  they also have great rice  salad  and just a nice atmosphere in general  there were some bikers there  but they didn t cause any trouble i visited  kashima  as a day trip  the area hosts the gatalympics  which is basically a mud version of olympics  in the tidal flats of the ariake sea  although there s not much in the winter  kashima also has yutaka inari shrine  if you re planning to visit kyoto s fushimi inari shrine but get turned off by all the tourists  i d highly rend this as an alternative  i didn t really do much at the shrine itself  although the architecture is extremely impressive  their honden is on the side of a cliff held up by giant supports  but the mountain behind it is a very nice hike  which rewards you with an amazing view some of the best moments in saga  though  were the small things  walking around outside in the countryside at night  you re amazed at just how quiet and dark it can be  or how many stars there really are  or walking to a 7 11 through dirt roads surrounded by rice paddies at 3am  just to buy a fresh yakisoba bun  absolutely everyone in this prefecture was so friendly  and the scenery was stunning  if you do go  however  please watch out for traffic or you may get hit amp x200b fukui  is the least visited prefecture in japan  which was a huge reason for me to go  i wasn t disappointed  they have the best dinosaur museum probably on the planet  in  katsuyama  actually  almost everything fun was in katsuyama  the dinosaur museum is great for all ages and casuals all the way to hardcore enthusiasts  there s also a massive castle  with a good collection of sengoku era artifacts from all around japan  aside from katsuyama  fukui city has a lot of great restaurants and also a foot bath  there s also scenic tojinbo cliffs  best seen at sunset and perfect for selfies  i really enjoyed it in fukui and plan toe back soon the final interesting place we visited was  tokushima  4th least visited prefecture  it s on shikoku and right beside kagawa  this is a very mountainous rural area  while we stayed nominally in miyoshi city  in reality our guesthouse was in a hamlet of perhaps 100 people  it was a new building  with aon area for guests  well appointed with necessities  our bedroom was immaculate  with our own private entrance  there was also a kettle bath where you could soak while watching the stars at night  i couldn t rend the place more  it s guest house osakanakun  the owner is a rafting guide  really nice couple and their adorable kids  there s great hiking opportunities in the surrounding mountains  and it was very close to the iya valley iya valley  is one of japan s most remote and unspoiled regions  praying that doesn t change  getting in and around is cumbersome  because it s served by a mishmash of different bus routes  none of whom bother to connect with each other very well  but there s authentic rope bridges over the gorge  heart stopping  for me at least  avoid if you dislike heights  and perhaps most creepy of all  a village of scarecrows  literally  it s a village up in the mountains with no people  but scarecrows placed all around  even the elementary school  you can just walk in and there s nothing but scarecrows  caught in a tableau of human movements  i heard the village is all old people  and they make the scarecrows because most people moved away  we did not see another soul outside of one old lady waiting at the bus stop  beautiful but creepy  and sad  a bit  too iya also had a really cool waterfall  and a boat ride on the gorge with some impressive rock formations  i really regret not visiting in the summer  when there s so much more outdoor activities  such as river rafting  but it was a lot of fun nonetheless  they serve a weird type of food there that i absolutely adored  dekomawashi  it s a 3 piece skewer of the local tofu  best tofu ever  potato  and konnyaku  delicious and super cheap  it s sold in stands throughout the area  also just the local tofu in general is very firm and tasty amp x200b well  that s all the cool places i ve been to lately  wow  i wrote a lot  sorry for the novel haha ,1
trip report  tokyo  gt  niseko  gt  tokyo, amp x200b  got the pasamo and personalised it on the spot with my name  so kitsch but feels so awesome  generally hate coins and loved using pasamo at convenient stores  japan has so much single use plastic  i brought a keepcup  and my own pack of wipes  as well as a loqi bag for small shopping trips  hmm  stuff i packed just in case  painkillers  dry shampoo  and tampons    upgraded to business class with qantas points in jal  no perks associated except for a wider seat  no lounge access  no food during the flight  no early boarding or seperate check in  jal s domestic business class is a joke  class j  and not worth it    leaving japan was easy in terms of tax free purchases  the digital gates are open to foreigners so there s none of that tax free checking  we still took photos of the tax free items  sealed  in the bags we checked in just in case  also note  my itinerary is pretty boring  we spent a lot of time walking around  shopping and napping after our ski trip  wish we went to spas more  i tried to keep this as brief as possible  i too hate reading long paragraphs  hoping the below is sort of helpful to some who are searching this sub  especially snowbirds heading to niseko as i couldn t find much while searching the thread leg 1  tokyo    fly into tokyo narita and take the keisei skyliner in  5040¥ for two  changed at ueno  walk is about 7 10 minutes  to hibiya line to roppongi    went to teamlab borderless and uobei sushi  both are good and reviewed on the internet  i won t detail too much here    picked up some extra warm layers at uniqlo in ginza  the ultra heat tech stuff is 1290¥ currently   give or take less than half price from where i m from    stayed at airport hotel night before our flight   it was cheaper and saved us more time in the morning  smooth enough leg 2  niseko  6 15am flight to cts  new chitose sapporo  jal flights were every 10 minutes  we left enough time between arrival at cts and the bus that we took to hirafu  went with white liner    we stayed at a hotel called niseko hakuunso and couldn t rend it enough  all the reviews online are basically 5 stars and for good reason  it s spacious  quiet  super close to the gondola  and relatively decently pricedpared to the rest of hirafu  there s also a hotel onsen that s quite private    i also got a bit sick so i went to the niseko international clinic for a checkup and potentially antibiotics  the checkup cost me 16000 yen plus 5000 for a medical certificate  it s quite easy to get to however  and is literally a stop on the hirafu shuttle    on our return  we went with hokkaido resort liner buspany  and honestly white liner was nicer  with a cleaner bus  and a bit better organised with signage directions etc    cts airport has way more food and shops outside than inside the terminal  heads up if you want food the snow  apparently the season wasn t that great but we arrived at a lucky time and experienced large dumps of snow daily  if you re a beginner this won t matter as much in the lower groomed runs   ski school  i had to get better at skiing so i enrolled in classes with gosnow  instructors are a hit and miss  some are really great and generally these are the ones who instruct for their careers  others are university students  or even ones fresh out of high school  and they weren t as attentive or good at teaching  remember  it s not about how well they ski  it s about how well they teach  the other ski schools you see are  niss  nvss  grand hirafu  nbs  pure hokkaido  nas  pick a ski school based on where you want to  base  yourself and where your hotel is access to the meeting point  i really improved heaps over the 4 days of ski lessons i took so i would definitely renditting to them if you can    another point regarding booking classes with gosnow   don t bother with their superpacks and dont  book too many  they re very rigid in terms of their faqs terms amp conditions and won t let you change any dates  the injury policy is also odd as you have to present a medical certificate 24 hours  before  the day you want to cancel  the money you save isn t that much anyways  at least it s not worth the risk in my opinion  you can still book online and get the  10  discount  the night before     mountain passes  the mountain is divided into four  hanazono  grand hirafu  niseko village  annapuri  to access all four you need a  niseko united pass  which is slightly more expensive than the  grand hirafu pass  alone  i rend buying this online because the process of getting your pass is so quick and automated when you get there  scan a qr code  and the machine spits out your pass with your name on it  the 500yen  deposit  is non refundable  what we did was do 5 hrs pass at grand hirafu  5100yen  5 days niseko united  34 800yen  and another 5 hrs at grand hirafu  5100yen  for reference  a full day niseko united lift pass is 8000yen     gear hire  i rented at  grand hirafu wee centre  and it was a great decision  the prices are more reasonable than the foreigner operated ones  yamasport  harros  and rhythm are the culprits thate into mind  and the equipment is just as good  if not newer  the valet service is awesome because you dont  need to carry your skis and boots back to the hotel  you can also leave a small backpack whatever you want in the same section where you put your boots  the mountain centre is also brand new as they only opened it this season  super helpful english speaking staff too   the runs     i did all of them except for the ones in annapuri and the blacks at niseko village   trail map here   green runs  even if you re a beginner  i would avoid the holiday and silver dream as these have terrible flat sections where you have to shuffle walk across  same goes with the king area access pass  remmeber to pick up speed before you turn on the flat bit  and bomb the way until you reach the tunnel   red runs  the easier reds are centre and alpen  be aware of the short black section at the start of furiko kokutai and at the end of jumbo  if you re sort of at the intermediate level  and want to go to the peak  the wonderland and ukairo are totally doable reds  take note of visibility though     black runs  the easiest blacks are ni kabe and legends of shinya at hanazono  if it dumps  miharashi is an absolute dream  and the large has good challenging moguls     off piste  if you re a beginneintemediate  i would rend the strawberry fields  the entrance has a sign and is near the hanazono quad lift  2  turns are manageable and lots of tracks usually so you re notpletely lost in the powder  the other off piste section i would rend would be the trees between center and rinkan as thises out at the beginners access path smoothly  i can tent on other back countryplicated off piste  not that good yet the food in hirafu   what i would highly rend  pizza rolls at the food trucks  we had this three times  enishii for japanese food  above niseko pizza  bo yo so on the mountain  really cheap  cash only  delicious ramen   do not go at standard lunch time go at 2pm instead  hokkaido takahashi cheese tarts  on the main street  the tart just melts in your mouth and the pastry is so buttery  tozanken ramen on the main street  go at 9pm to avoid the insane line   what i found overrated  a bu cha 2  so average and overpriced  the restaurant at the gondola base   pro tip  instead of going to this restaurant at the base go to the hotel s  ki niseko s  restaurant instead  the prices are similar and quality of food and service are both exponentially better  leg 3  tokyo again   we were pretty boring so i ve only bulleted the highlights below activity wise  visited the meiji shrine park  there is a lovely garden inside the park  entry is 500¥  while it was serene in winter i m sure it would be absolutely stunning in more colourful seasons  great way to avoid the crowds  mori art museum has a really cool exhibition on  cities of the future and artificial intelligence  don t forget student ids if you have it  concession is half price  shimokitazawa was a bomb for second hand shopping  picked up a burberry skirt fo 5000yen  a patagonia puffy vest for 2000yen  and lots of good quality second hand denim  also would really rend the tokyo museum of western art at ueno if you re into architecture western art  entry was only 500  250 for a student  cheap as chips and cool as hell food wise  stayed in roppongi  and had maison keyser pastries  located at tokyo midtown  but pretty sure it s a chain  every  single  day  for breakfast  best pastries i ve had and rivalling some of the best in paris    went to shimokitazawa in pursuit of hiroshima style okonomoyaki at hirochi  super delicious and affordable  they re pretty big so if you re not too hungry i would suggest sharing one between two    fast food that blew my mind  mcdonald s new rice burger  family mart s fami chiki  and grape flavoured smirnoff ice    as for cheap food ayce  we went to nazebo  hot pot  2800yen pp  and gyo kaku  yakiniku  3800yen pp  both were pretty decent in terms of quality of product and variety  the latter uses a gas not charcoal grill if you care about that stuff  torikizoku isn t ayce butes to a similar price range and was bloody great for a group that wanted a good feed  atmosphere  and delicious drinks amp x200b that s all i can think of at the moment  will edit if i remember more  hope this helps someone out there  i also did lots of skincare makeup shoppping  but will save that for a different post   feel free to ask any qs ,1

hokkaido   tohoku   16 days   july 2020   itinerary check,hi again so  after some reading here on reddit and on the internet  i made a first sketch of an itinerary for our hokkaido   tohoku trip in july  i am a bit overwhelmed by the too little but at the same time somehow too much amount of information about travelling around in tohoku  theres not much info but everything i ve read about i have added to the itinerary and well  it is not doable at all  a first idea is 04 july   sapporo arrival at sapporo at 16h    check in  walk  dinner and sleep 05 july   sapporo   whole day to visit the city 06 july   sapporo   otaru day trip 07 july   sapporo to noboribetsu   taking the train early in the morning to spend the whole day in noboribetsu 08 july   noboribetsu to hakodate   arriving in the morning  rest of the day to visit the city 09 july   hakodate to aomori  visiting around aomori10 july   aomori to akita   i ve been rended to take the resort shirakami train  experiences  i guess spending the day on the train and stopping at a couple of smaller places along the way 11 july   akita12 july   akita to sendai   taking the train early in the morning and using the day to visit the city 13 july   sendai   geibikei gorge trip in the morning  afternoon to continue visiting sendai itself 14 july   sendai to tokyo   here i am doubting whether to spend the morning in sendai and heading towards tokyo in the afternoon evening or taking the day for tokyo too  i also read that the local train from sendai to yamagata is nice  with nice stops along the way  so another option could be in the morning sendai to yamagata  stopping a couple of times  and then in the evening taking the shinkansen to tokyo 15 18 july   tokyo 19 july   flight back amp x200b so  my main questions here are  i have my doubts regarding noboribetsu as i ve read mixed opinions  is it worth the time or shall we head somewhere different  and what about hakodate  is it enjoyable or better spend the day at some other place  in the previousents to this thread there were ideas about lake toya  furano  asahikawa  during our previous trip  tokyo was our last stop and we had very bad luck with the weather plus we were destroyed from all the walking the previous 2 weeks and we did not see nor enjoyed it a lot  this time i want to make sure i reserve reasonable enough time to discover it  is 4 days ok  or shall i cut time from sendai and give it to tokyo  experiences with the shirakami train  which stops along the way would you rend  there are several options for day trips from sendai  which are your favourites  options i ve read of are geibikei gorge  matsushima  goishi coastline  doable without a car  yamadera  hiraizumo  zao onsen any tips  rendations and ideas are more than wee many thanks everyone ,1

1 resident   1 tourist w  jr pass   reserving seats together ,i have read the faq and the special jr pass page  and couldn t find what i was looking for  i know i could just ask at a big jr office  but i figure there must have been other people in this situation before i am currently living in osaka and have a visa  so am ineligible for the jr pass  my bf ising to visit in spring  and for part of his trip  plans to use the jr pass to travel to tokyo and back  i m planning on going with him on the shinkansen  but just buying ordinary tickets my initial plan was to just use the non reserved carriages  but after reading the faq it appears there are some trains in which all carriages are reserved  and also from what i can tell i m probably going to end up paying a seat fee which includes a reservation anyway questions are as follows 1  if buying a shinkansen ticket normally  is a seat reservation normally included  or is it possible to pay less for an unreserved ticket   fairly sure i ve been given unreserved tickets before when travelling for work 2  howon is it for trains to bepletely reserved  and is there a way for me to reliably check this  have looked at jr timetables but don t recall it being clearly marked  3  if i do want to make seat reservations  is there a way of doing so so that we get seats together  even though he s on the jr pass and i m not  and if so  which office should i go to  the jr pass designated place or just the standard ticket office   id probably be able to explain in japanese ,1

cherry blossom and latest update,hi  now that the 3rd update for cherry blossoms is in and apparently now peak blossom is even earlier again  i am concerned that i m going to miss them during my april trip  i ve researched  read and seen time lapse pictures but am still unsure  question   if i m travelling to tokyo 4 6th and kyoto 6 11th of april  will cherry blossoms  although pass peak  still be on the branches  or highly likely green leaves by then  i guess i have that concern like most travellers that the window to see actual flowers is so small that outside of it is pointless  any one with experience that can give advice  thanks  in advance ,1

itinerary check  tokyo  kiso valley  takayama  koyasan  kyoto  yakushima  miyajima,my husband and i are planning a 16 day delayed honeymoon trip to japan on may 9th 26th  i ve been before but my husband hasn t  i went 14 years ago with my family and did the standard tokyo gt takayama gt  kyoto gt hiroshima miyajima trip  so this time i m trying to add some new stuff for myself while also not letting my husband miss anything important  i m trying to strike a balance between seeing historical japanese stuff  seeing nature  and seeing current japanese culture  and trying to do a couple of things a little off the beaten path   i didn t enjoy tokyo as much as the rest of japan last time i went  which is why i only have us there for 3 days  for those first few days in tokyo i m thinking of getting the jr 3 day tokyo wide pass  and then the 14 jr pass for the rest since i think it s cheaper than a 21 day jr pass         parts of this itinerary still need some filling in  but this is what i have so far      may 10   arrive in tokyo       i don t have anything planned for this day since i figure we will be very jetlagged       may 11 13   tokyo and side trips       this part i ve only loosly planned  but i m thinking of spending one day walking around west tokyo  one day in nikko  and one day making a day trip to see fujisan  we might change hotels the last night to one next to shinagawa station in order to get to kiso valley earlier the next morning      may 14   tokyo to kiso valley     leave tokyo early and make it to nakatsugawa hopefully before lunch time  take the bus to magome and eat lunch there  then walk along the nakasendo from magome to tsumago and hopefully stay at fujioto ryokan for the night  i m thinking of  forwarding a small overnight bag to the ryokan ahead of time  does anyone know if this is possible in a place like kiso valley      may 15   kiso valley to takayama via nagoya     spend the rest of the day in takayama  i don t have much planned in case we need a break this day      may 16   takayama to koyasan      spend the morning looking around takayama and then travel to koyasan  explore koyasan and stay the night in a temple lodging      may 17   koyasan to kyoto      spend the first half of the day in koyasan and then travel to kyoto  if we have time  do some shopping in kyoto in the afternoon evening      may 18 21 kyoto     spend 3 days looking around kyoto and then maybe a day trip to himeji castle  i haven t fully planned out what we ll do in kyoto  but i am hoping we ll get to see kabuki and maiko performances   any info about booking these would be appreciated      may 22  kyoto to yakushima via osaka airport     fly to yakushima from osaka airport early  possibly with a layover in kagoshima  rent a car during our stay in yakushima since i read that the busses don t run often  spend the rest of the day exploring yakushima maybe take a short hike  hopefully stay in yakushima green hotel      may 23   yakushima     get a bento either from the hotel or in town and spend the day in yakushima hiking   any trail recs would be appreciated      may 24   yakushima to fukuoka          return the rental car  take the boat to kagoshima  and then then the train to fukuoka  then explore the city  try the food stands  etc      may 25   fukuoka to hiroshima miyajima     take the train to hiroshima  and then the ferry to miyajima  our plan is to stay in another ryokan in miyajima       may 26   fly home from osaka airport in the afternoon evening      take the train to osaka in the morning  if there s some spare time  look around osaka for a few hours before heading to the airport     what do you guys think of this itinerary  does this give us enough time to see everything  is there anything we should skip  so far i have yet to book anything  so any suggestions insights would be wee ,1
shinkansen planning,i m currently writing up an itinerary for a 2 week trip to japan later this year where the first week is spent in tokyo  then most of the second week is spent in osaka  i plan to get to osaka via the shinkansen  but upon investigating the various options for buying tickets  i m left a little conflicted  the 7 day japan rail pass would only save me a relatively tiny amount of money  i m talking single digit pounds  for the journeys to and from osaka  and none of the guides i ve seen when ites to reserved seats seem to mention anything about reserving specific seats  the smartex app apparently doesn t seem to play well with debit cards  and i m currently unsure about booking the tickets in cash since i plan on paying for everything in cash i ve spent the whole year saving up   since i want to be sure i have enough spending money for the whole trip  i feel paying in cash would lose the advantage that the japan rail pass would have of setting aside the cost beforehand  what would you rend ,1
trip report  2 weeks with a toddler in osaka,i used the wisdom of this sub extensively when planning our trips to japan   particularly the more niche travelling with toddler posts  this time around   so here s my contribution  i ve missed some things because i had to rely heavily on google photos to write this up we travelled in november 2019  this was our second trip   our first was tokyo kanazawa kyoto and smaller towns a couple of years ago some general thoughts as usual we used google maps to plan the trip  making a rough plan for what we could do and where we could eat  we normally just decide each morning what we ll actually do each day  though our interests are art  culture  history  coffee  food  beer and baked goods  we found osaka easier to navigate than tokyo  and tokyo wasn t difficult  people were friendly  everywhere we went there were choruses of  kawaii  the food was great  although we didn t get to go  to the full range of restaurants we d have liked to  see below   and thoughts on travelling to japan with a baby i really agonised over whether it was sensible  or fair  to take a toddler to japan  in the end  we went because our toddler is  for a toddler   extremely  easy to cope with  we had one proper tantrum the entire trip  also   bear with me on this one   our toddler is a non sleeper  so jetlag wasn t an issue  they re always jetlagged  the first couple of nights were a bit rough  3 or 4 hours in the middle of the night wrangling an excited toddler  but after that it settled down again  to our normal  which  to be frank  is pretty dire  we packed as many snacks as we could realistically carry  plus some favoured small toys and little books  i over prepped travel toys  post its  little puzzles  that kind of stuff  but the airplane itself was the best toy we picked osaka because we thought it would be a baby friendly destination  it 100  was  it was incredibly easy to get around  people were very aodating and we managed to pack a surprising amount in  our usual attitude towards holidays is  all the culture  all the time  but we recognise that we ve had to slow it down with a toddler in tow  we tried to pick activities and food that we thought he d enjoy on the subject of food  you know what i said our toddler was easy to cope with  his favourite foods are rice and fish  he really  really loved the food  normally we restrict his rice intake  not on this trip i was concerned about finding restaurants every day  but we had no problems  in fact  i d say it was actually  easier  than on baby free trips  because there was less dithering and hangry arguments  if somewhere looked okay  we were eating there  we mainly stuck to department store restaurants or places i knew would be baby friendly  almost everywhere we went had highchairs  we d planned on eating at some of the family chains like royal host  but didn t need to in the end  we bought a lot of snacks from conbini  we quickly identified whole milk  string cheese  yoghurt pouches and so on  onigiri were also a hit nappies  we brought enough with us so didn t need to buy any there  also that meant we had space on the way back for souviners  we had also booked the most baby friendly aodation we could find  with a well stocked kitchen  so we ate breakfasts and many dinners at home  shopping for ingredients at the local market and then cooking them at home is something i love to do on holiday anyway  one of our favourite homemademeals was fresh tofu from the little local tofu factory  noodles from the local noodle factory and stock for breakfast we mostly ate buns  japanese buns are the best day 1 i was dreading the plane trip   and having to find our way to our aodation with zero sleep  in the end  it was okay  the toddler napped for a few hours in the travel cot  we napped  we watched films  we ate  we survived on arrival  we headed straight for our airbnb in a residential park of osaka  near kujo station  unfortunately the highchair that came with the house was broken and the buggy was nearly broken  but the room full of toys was very wee  we had supper at  grand front osaka  the restaurant we picked wasn t even the most baby friendly  but it still had a highchair and a kids  menu  we hit the local supermarket for breakfast stuff  honestly  shopping there every day was a trip highlight day 2 after some amount of sleep  we got up and went straight to  osaka castle  stopping only to snack on tuna mayonnaise onigiri from a 711  we strolled around  ate takoyaki  admired the trees and napped  toddler only  afterwards we went on to  boulangerie and cafe gout  for the first of many bun stops  we were initially thrown by the ordering system  tray  self service  pay  collect a number  go to your table empty handed and await buns next the toddler needed to burn off some energy so we stopped off at the  osaka museum of history  we weren t expecting to like this quite as much as we did  the models of the old city were fantastic  views from the museum were also good finally we had a wonder around  dotonbori  in the rain and stopped for pancakes at  tables cafe  really  really  really good pancakes today also included an emergency buggy purchase  given the state of the buggy at the airbnb  we d brought the ergobaby carrier but with the toddler taking 2 hour plus naps it was a lot easier to get a buggy  sidenote  every station in osaka seemed to have lifts and we had no problems getting around  the buggy we bought was ridiculously light and easy to fold for the rare occasion we needed to take the stairs day 3 one of the main things i wanted to do in osaka was  expo  70 park  apparently every other family in osaka also wanted to do that  on the same day as us  the atmosphere was great  we got takeaway sushi from expocity and picnicked in the park  seeing the tower of the sun was great  we also bought tickets at the entrance for the landscape garden  which contained the toddler s highlight  loads of koi fish in a pond  we stayed there for a long  long time day 4 first kyoto day  got a train there and had an early lunch at an omurice restaurant in the station  we tried to get a bus to the north of the city but the toddler got annoyed  so we had to get off  no problem  kyoto is packed with things to do  we explored  higashiyama  stopping off at a ghibli shop  some small shrines and the  rocca and friends  truck before going all the way up to  kiyomizu dera  great foliage views  due to inability to find a suitable cafe  when the toddler woke up from an afternoon nap  i had to breastfeed in public  i did get a couple of double takes  but otherwise fine  we continued to expore some local sights before heading back to the station to eat soba noodles for supper day 5 we explored  amerika mura  stopping for coffee and chiffon sandwiches at  the roasters coffee shinsaibashi  we had yuzu and strawberry and they were perfect  we had lunch at  eggs n things  because i d heard it was very baby friendly   which it was  this was one of the toddler s favourite meals of the trip  a big ol  bowl of poke  next we stopped at a local playpark to let off some steam   an international nursery school was also there  running laps  so it was pretty fun  the toddler then napped while we shopped on  orange street  the rest of the day was taken up with wandering around this area day 6 day trip to  himeji  to see  himeji castle  and  kokoen garden  we picked a fantastic day for this   clear blue skies all day  we had a bento lunch on the train to save time so we could spend the whole day sightseeing  the autumn foliage in the garden was wonderful   and more koi fish for the toddler to get excited about back in osaka we had doria at a restaurant in  namba parks  we d never heard of doria but all loved it  we played on some arcade machines and had fun looking at the christmas light displays on the roof day 7 osaka aquarium  i d been very excited about this but it was just okay   and very expensive for  just okay  the toddler was also very excited but fell asleep after about ten minutes  oh well  the whale sharks were great to see we had lunch at the shopping centre next to the aquarium before heading back into town to explore the area around  tennoji park  we stopped for some very fancy hot chocolate at  yard coffee and craft chocolate  on a corner of the park  in the early evening we wandered around  shinsekai  collected figurines from the capsule machines and marvelled at giant shop signs   day 8 we started the day exploring  nakazakicho  mumokuteki  was the best shop we found   we got nearly all of our christmas shopping done here  we had lunch in a korean restaurant on top of  hep five  this turned out to be the toddler s favourite restaurant of the entire trip  because it overlooked multiple train and tram lines  the food was good too more shopping was up next  including a pitstop at the lego shop to admire the giant lego train  we also found a little interactive digital play area in one of the shopping centres where we befriended some small children  in the evening we went back to  dotonbori  finally we had our personal meal highlight of the trip   gyozah and beer at  gyozaoh  dotonbori  it was not baby friendly  but we d heard that the staff were so friendly this didn t matter  that was 100  true  we sat at the bar with the toddler on our laps and ate not nearly enough gyozoah  there was another family travelling with a pre teen using a wheelchair   the restaurant definitely has a reputation day 9 second kyoto day  the restaurant we were aiming for at lunchtime seemed to be closed  so we ended up at a tiny neighbourhood place that did amazing fried chicken but very suspect tomato ramen  you win some  you lose some  we walked onto  kinkakuji temple  which was crowded but lovely  we managed to squeeze in a green tea and sugary treat during naptime  next we pushed the buggy round the  imperial palace gardens   not reended  very gravelly  so stressful  before heading back to osaka to drink craft beers at the house day 10 day trip to  minoo falls  the toddler was so excited by the train trip there  the hankyu railway trains are extremely classy  that we achieved a three hour nap  so the whole day had a very relaxed feel  we ate snacks all day  including some very crunchy maple tempura  excellent autumn foliage  back in the city  we had a quick look at the  christmas market  around the umeda sky building  the toddler was gifted a tiny flashing santa  it s awful  still loves it  we wanted to go up umeda sky building but the queue was ridiculous we ended the day with a trip to  bornelund  near umeda  which has a dreamlike softplay  it was amazing and i m sad there s nothing like that here  it was bright  clean  expansive and   crucially   had a rest area with vending machines  amazing day 11 it was around this point that we realised our flight home was  in fact  24 hours later than we d realised  oops  thankfully past us were a lot brighter than present us and had booked aodation for the correct dates  so we had a bonus day  we still had some christmas shopping to do  so today was shopping day  we started off at  abeno q s  for kids stuff and sweets  which also turned out to have a great softplay  lunch was at a fancy department store restaurant somewhere above or around tennoji station  during naptime we went up  abeno harukas harukas 300  which had no queue  unlike umeda sky  and a bar at the top serving craft beer  amazing  on the way home we stopped at  brooklyn roastingpany namba  for fancy coffees and cookies on our final night we were treated to a display of the osaka fire service in action when there was a fire alarm in a building on our street  luckily there wasn t a fire and nobody was hurt  but we did get to witness the supreme speed and organisation of the fire service finally i m really glad we went   we made some great memories  ate some great food and the toddler learnt to say  rice   noodles  and  fish  i m actually sad we couldn t go for longer  tiring as travelling with a toddler is  we still talk about the food and trains with him i very much enjoyed seeing japan again from a family point of view  we went to places we d never have been without a child  and talked to people we wouldn t have talked to otherwise  it felt very different from travelling as an unencumbered couple  different  more tiring  but worth doing happy to answer questions or provide a list of baby friendly restaurants in osaka ,1

trip advice nagano,a couple of friends and i are thinking of spending up to 3 days in nagano before heading back to tokyo  we initially wanted to stay in matsumoto and then travel to kamikochi which was the main reason that we decided to choose nagano    we were wondering if there are any other sights to see around matsumoto or the nagano region similar to kamikochi  some ideas we had are to visit nagano city or the sora terrace  maybe megami lake  we are planning to go around april 18 to 21 and will be using public transport  would really appreciate some advice on where to go and activities to do ,1

super delayed trip report   april 2019  13 days     osaka himeji kobe nara kyoto tokyo ,hey everyone  i wanted to start with saying  thanks to this greatunity for all the helpful tips advice  going through everyone s itineraries and trip reports have been nostalgic ever since  clearly we miss japan so much that since we have to go to se asia this summer   might as well do another trip to japan again  but first  i need to share this trip report  better late than never  i ve been told  also  apologies for the long report  i kept a travel diary and this was essentially my dream vacation  so i hope this is helpful planning  this was our 2nd country in our big honeymoon trip  but was the bulk of the trip  we were in south korea  seoul busan jeju  the week prior to this and then hong kong macau afterwards  we needed to pack smart somewhat light so we have enough space for souvenirs      before  3 suitcases in total  fit mostly everything into one large suitcase  and then had a suitcase inside a suitcase for extra things  i had my 32l arcteryx bag as carry on and my husband had a small bag for daily necessities     after   we had to buy an extra big luggage  with all the stuff with bought and we had two extra carry on bags   trust me    if you re really into japanese culture in any aspect  but especially if you love video games  a ufo catcher addict  or want to stock up on teas and other souvenirs   bring all the luggage that you can  both of us had a few physical conditions that were just resolved right before the trip  i had bad sciatica and had to do physio for 3 months prior  the husband had a bad back and was doing chiro for maybe 2 months prior  i have really bad flat feet and i knew there were going to be tons of walking  so i brought my orthotics and two pairs of shoes  our  read  mine  were really sore everyday either way  but it was worth it  chose to get sim cards  gt  pocket wifi in case we wanted to roam in different areas and we like to stay  online  chose  mobal sim card    they ll deliver to your home address and also profits go to charity  chose icoca ic card  gt  jr rail pass  even with the amount of travelling time we stayed  the jr pass would ve been more expensive  i also pre ordered our cards via  klook  and picked them up at the airport booth  we wanted to see the cherry blossoms and were following the forecast that s posted in this subreddit  we saw the tail end of the blossoms when we got there  but we were able to see them in busan the week before  so we were happy  it  looks  like the trend is that the blossoms areing out earlier and earlier  cough  climate change cough  for those who are thinking about chasing cherry blossoms  i know basic japanese and can read write hiragana katakana  my husband  since he s chinese  helped out with more challenging kanji  but in either cases  there are a lot of english signage and information desks for visitors  if anything  japanese people are very helpful and google translate works wonders tips  if you know you want to do this specific activity  i e  ghibli museum  teamlab borderless  eorzea cafe  tea ceremony  kimono rental  etc  and eat somewhere  i e  kichi kichi omurice  sushi sho masa  be prepared to stalk their websites to see when you can reserve at the earliest as possible  i have a big fomo anxiety and wasn t sure when was the next time we were going back  we managed to book all the experiences we 100  wanted and even got help from this lovely subredditunity  we used govoyagin to reserve sushi sho masa because most high end restaurants will only take reservations with those who have a local phone number  even if the restaurant you want is full  they ll still refund you the reservation fee  you will be walking doing stairs a lot here  even with a busy itinerary  find some time to rest somewhere  it s also a good excuse for an onsen sento stop  google map works wonders unless you re in a crowded underground area  we ve only had trouble a few times  but that was mostly the first few days getting our bearings  cash is preferred   some family members didn t think that we d get the best currency exchange rates from atms in japan  but it turns out  that s the best place  the second best place would be the random discount ticket shops or  kinken shops  found in popular areas  we basically went from one booth to the other until we found the best exchange rate  when travelling on the  shinkansen  from kyoto to tokyo  sit on the  left  side of the train so you can see mt fuji  on a clear day  if you re travelling the opposite way  then sit on the  right  side  you don t have much time when boarding the  shinkansen   maybe 5 mins or less  from what we ve observed and experienced  big luggages can be placed on the above rack  but you ll have to fight for room  try the udon  really  for some reason  this wasn t on our  must eat  list because udon is udon right  it tastes a lot bettedifferent the the udon we were used to  also   curry  udon  yummm home base itinerary  apr 6 9 osaka  with day trips to himeji kobe and nara  apr 10 13 kyoto  apr 13 18 tokyo arriving in kix airport osaka  when you exit the airport to go to public trains  it was very overwhelming  it was probably because we arrived around 7pm from korea and a bit disoriented with the language culture  if you re not sure which train route to take to your hotel s location  just go to the service desk and ask them there  we were staying close to osaka station  so we were able to get a ticket that covered us the whole way there  rather than start our icoca card  the sheer volume of people is insane and will probably get some getting used to  we ended up getting lost in the underground of osaka umeda station  which  apparently is called the   umeda dungeon  for this reason  this is where google maps didn t work  stayed at hotel wing international and everything was great  we don t splurge on big hotels because we just want a place to sleep and store everything  but this place had a  goody bag  every day that you didn t use the housekeeping   it came with bottled water  slippers  bathrobes  towels  toiletries  etc  we had so many near the end that we just piled them all in the small jacket closet  had our first ichiran ramen experience and it was really good  we have tons of ramen places at home  but ramen  and anything  in japan was next level  the way they had the vendor like machines to order your meal is really interested convenient genius  especially if you don t want to handle money osaka castle and nishinomaru garden  spent most of the time in the garden area to check out the cherry blossoms  it was a sunday  so there were a lot of people doing  hanami  ate our first bunch of takoyaki   omgosh  if you love takoyaki  but it s like 8  for just 6 pcs   eat all the takoyaki in japan you can find  it s so cheap and you get so much  we paid 10  for 16 pcs  4 different flavors  the garden itself is quite big and has different types of cherry blossoms there  taking photos of them with osaka castle in the background is quite nice  we decided not to go inside the castle itself because there was a huge line dotonbori area and eorzea cafe  wandered around and looked at all the different stalls and restaurants  everything looked super appetizing but we found a  kaiten sushi  place that wasn t busy at the time  even the sushi here was amazing  we couldn t eat a lot because we had a reservation at eorzea cafe later on  so we could only snack  eorzea cafe was pretty fun  especially if you re a ffxiv fan  a good samaritan kindly helped us with securing reservations at both the osaka and tokyo locations as a gift as we were having trouble reserving with our credit cards  there s only a few foreign cards they ll accept now  the hosts were quite fun and we ended up winning the  jumbo cactpot himeji castle and kobe harbourland  spent a day trip to himeji castle   this part is  slightly  biased because it s been one of the dream locations that i ve wanted to visit since forever  having the castle and cherry blossoms blooming is pretty amazing to see  we got there pretty late and we only had an hour to go inside the castle grounds  which i thought was enough  we saw that there may have been a queue system earlier in the day that we avoided  phew  the architecture itself is pretty great and even how different holes in the wall were strategically angled and in different shapes were interesting  on the way back  we hopped off the train and walked around kobe s harbourland  seeing the bay area was nice and perused through the different shops  ended up biting the bullet and trying a chateaubriand cut of a5 wagyu and sukiyaki at one of the restaurants and even thought the beef was so good  very buttery creamy  we should ve found a better place deal experience  we were barely full  that s what we get for trying the most expensive cut  so we headed back to ichiran again before ending the day  i think next time we ll try one of those places that has all you can eat with some cuts of wagyu nara deer park  woke up late and went shopping before heading over here  one thing that i truly appreciate about japan is how low the crime rate is and how safe it is to leave belongings in a locker at the train station  we live in vancouver and if there were lockers at our stations  they would all be broken into  even the bicycle lockers get broken into  i say this because we had a big haul of merchandise that we had to bring with us but  thankfully  didn t have to lug around the park for the deers to eat  one thing we missed was the mochi pounding show at nakatanidou  we arrived just as it ended and were starting to sell the mochi  it was still warm and really nice  i picked up my  goshuincho  book at kokufu ji temple while we were strolling by and received their stamp  i was going to get the second stamp at todaiji temple  but when we got there  the grounds were just closing  the deer in nara are smart  there were a few stalls where you can buy the deer cookies and there were some lingering around  waiting for visitors to get the cookies  as soon as you turn around  they would be in front of you  if you buy mochi  or bring anything with you  make sure not to hold onto the container themselves  one deer almost outsmarted my husband and the rest of the mochi would ve been gone  also  the deer will still follow you and may even try to headbutt  literally  you  other than that  it was fun hanging out with them kyoto  we took the train to kyoto and stayed for 3 days  it was initially going to be 2 days because we wanted to squeeze in a hiroshima miyajima day trip  but was rended to leave that for another trip and enjoy the time in kyoto  even with 3 packed days  we barely hit all the places we wanted to go to  we stayed at ryokan kyoka  which is a family run ryokan near kyoto tower  there is no private onsen bath  but there s an option to enjoy a normal bath in the later hours  the caretakers were quite nice  even though there wasn t much interaction  we were grateful for the things they did to make our stayfortable  it was raining the day we got there and after being outside until the evening  it was really nice toe back to our room with the heater turned on and our futons prepared  the futons are unbelievablyfortable  not sure if that s the general consensus or because we ve been having packed days that we were tired  either way  we got good rest  husband was feeling sick so we decided to check out the  sento bath  in the basement of kyoto tower  we stayed for 1 5 hrs  more for him than me  we were in separate baths  so when i was feeling overheated  i got changed and hung out in the lounge area  thankfully  there was a pretty awesome foot massager that helped pass the time  is it just me  or does everything  main shops malls  close really early  by early  i mean 8pm or so  we re more night owls and thought we had more time to wander around  but even in the  kawaramachi  downtown area  the malls started closing and in the end  we went back home to watch movies  it was fine the first night because we had an early start the next morning  or maybe there s another area that has more night life fushimi inari  we got to fushimi inari around 4pm on a rainy weekday and the area was still busier than i expected  like most mentioned  the further you go up the mountain  the less visitors there are  also for those wanting a  goshuin  go before 3pm or so before the office closes  i was going to go back another day to get mine  but ran out of time  it was still awesome to see all the red torii gates aligned  another dream location checked off arashiyama and gion area  originally wanted to leave around 7am to be one of the first people there before the crowds tour buses  but we ended up getting to kyoto station around 8 30 instead  totally  forgot  about  rush hour  it was really interesting barely squeezing into the open end of the train and somehow getting shoved and packed to the other side  i liked it  i thought it was a good experience  husband wasn t amused  most of the people were students  so the mayhem only lasted for one or two stops  there were quite a number of tourists already heading the same way  with the same mindset to beat the crowd  so we didn t have to rely on google maps much  when we got to the bamboo forest  it was a good crowd   i think everyone wanted the same type of experience  serene  not loud  bothersome  etc  so we were pretty quiet  started raining more  so decided to hang out at tenryuu ji temple  apparently they have a famous vegetarian meal for those who may be interested  we had a packed day  so we kept going  went by the togetsukyo bridge and headed to the monkey park  it does take 30 mins walk up the mountain  but the view and the monkeys are pretty worth it  there s a small hut that you can go in and feed the monkeys from the windows  the adult monkeys were jerks and tried to take the food from the baby monkeys haha  on the way down  one group of monkeys surprised a kid by jumping down close to them camellia tea  headed to the opposite side of kyoto for a kimono rental and tea ceremony  we chose  camellia tea   flower location  for the ceremony and they have a deal with  yume kyoto  the ladies at the rental shop were great  we actually arrived close to our tea ceremony appointment  we took the wrong bus in the opposite direction and then taxi d the rest of the way  so they tried to help out as much as possible and even walked us over to camelia tea for our appointment  when we came back  they gave us a small gift because of our honeymoon  the tea ceremony was 45mins long  but the time went by faster than i wanted  the instructor spoke english and showed us a portion of the tea ceremony  we then tried making matcha and ate a traditional sweet  afterwards  we just lingered around and took photos with our kimono on  afterwards  we walked towards yasaka shrine  that goshuin office was closed as well  and headed back to the downtown area  ate a bit at nishiki market at the end of their day  close to 6pm  and wandered around until things closed early ish  again kurama onsen  the best onsen this trip  this outdoor onsen is located in the northern mountain area of kyoto and requires a bus ride up there  being able to get away from the busy streets and to relax in a pool  listening watching the wind blow through the trees was amazing  since it wasn t an indoor bath  i was able to stay in the water for a while and enjoy the experience  there is a choice of doing a day trip course  includes more facilities  or to just use the outdoor bath  you re also able to stay overnight if you wanted to stay longer and check out the neighbourhood surrounding temples kichi kichi omurice  for foodies that want to check this place out  make sure you stalk the website and reserve the moment the week you want bes available  even with stalking  if the date s  you want are full  try emailing as well  the food here is great  we ordered the omurice and the ox tail stew which were the two popular dishes  watching the chef s passion for cooking made the experience even better  he ll even show you step by step how to make his famous omurice and let you take videos photos  the omelette was really creamy and the ox tail was super tender and savory  definitely rend this place tokyo  stayed at sakura hotel in hatagaya  two stops on the toei oedo line from shinjuku station  pretty much the smallest room we ve had this trip  on the last day  we were trying to pack all our luggage and there was barely any room to move around  no washlet function inside your washroom  but funny enough they had washlets available on the ground floor  they also have a cafe on the ground floor and luggage storage available even after you ve checked out  checked out the usual scenes  shibuya crossing  senso ji temple  meiji jingu  tsukiji fish market  since there s probably a lot of posts about these  i ll mention other tokyo experiences ghibli museum  spent a good afternoon at the ghibli museum  i highly rend this for any ghibli fan   even if you just started watching the films  no photos or videos allowed  but this was the on of my highlights on this trip  you get to see a lot of what goes on  behind the scenes   and i ve found a new appreciation for miyazaki and his films  my favorite room was the one covered with sketches from the different films  the sketches were made on watercolor papepaint  which is what they mostly used for the background and scenic portions of the movies   so detailed  i could ve easily spent the rest of the day just going through all the art  there s also storyboards that you can go through in the room afterwards  for those that  hoard  collect merchandise  there s a store as well with  exclusive  merch  i got the pink totoro magnet  a black totoro plush  some cookies and a postcard  there were so many things  and so many people  that it can be a bit hectic  but the line to pay is quite fast shirohige s cream puff factory  there s a second location that s just opened up in kichijoji  which was a good walk from the ghibli museum  the original location is setagaya  by the time we got there in the mid late afternoon  all the cream puffs were sold out  we ended uping back before we left for the airport and managed to try the different flavors sushi sho masa  chose this restaurant for our first omakase because of the number of pieces you get for the price you pay  a lot of reviews mention that quite a number of people don t finish the full experience and it was correct for a few in our group  we ended up having 52 pieces in total and 4 beers for around 60 000y  some interesting pieces we had  tako with eggs sperm still inside  ankimo  pan shell  ark shell  the toro piece had 3 layers with wasabi inbetween and you couldn t taste it  there were a couple pieces that were charcoal grilled as well  everything was melt in your mouth perfect  we ve been having trouble deciding where our next omakase experience will be because this seems really hard to top teamlab borderless  accidentally slept in and got to the line up at 11 45am  wanted to get there right at opening  the line was pretty long   went all the way to the ground floor and around the corner of the building  but it also went through pretty fast  tip  get food before you get to the line up  otherwise you re stuck with the rest of the group ordering from wendy s there  and the line for that is just as long  spent a good 3 4 hours inside  mostly because of the lineups for the nest room and the lantern room  in the main room with the waterfall  there were tons of people wanting to get their  instagram photo  so we just took pictures on the side  all the rooms were pretty fun to interact with  apparently we missed one with the huge balloons  it s definitely a maze in there gunpla shopping  afterwards went to diver city just in time for the big unicorn gundam to transform  around 2pm  you know that you haven t missed it if there s a large group waiting around  i believe it transforms again later in the evening  but not sure what time  gundam base has exclusive gunpla kits if you re looking for those  otherwise  prices are a bit higher  after this  we checked out a couple of places in akihabara  including the yodobashi akiba  what we found was that the prices at yodobashi shinjuku and edi on  akihabara  were the cheapest eorzea cafe tokyo  the menu here vs  osaka is slightly different  this location is more english friendly and does have translations on the menu  we managed to have different specials which meant more things to try   little ladies day there  hatching tide here  no we didn t win the jumbo cactpot  but that was a good one time experience  i ve heard that some winners will split the huge honey toast with the rest of the groups during the seating  which is great less wasteful  each food item or drink you order gets you one special coaster   in this location  we were given the option of choosing between the old coasters and the new coasters  we chose mostly old ones this time because we didnt  want to have duplicates  there is a merchandise section in these cafes  if you want another rendation for more plushes  i d check out the yodobashi camera stores and the square enix cafes  tip  if you want to find coasters but not go to eorzea cafe  we later found some at stores like book off  they were individually priced  but we ended up grabbing morethat s pretty much it for our first trip to japan  we ll be going again right before the olympics  so i ll probably ask start asking for more rendations for the 2nd trip  once again  sorry for the long essay  i tried to condense it  as much as possible  cheers ,1

download festival in japan tokyo,hi guys we found that download is on while we re in tokyo so we re planning on dropping by if we can still nab tickets  all looks well online  but just have a quick few questions i m guessing tattoos are fine  site i m buying off says strictly no  gangsters  or yakuza it says 6 and over are wee to the event which seems a bit mind boggling  is that true can we drink at the venue  is it socially acceptable to drink at music festivals are outsiders typically wee at music festivals or are we going to be singled out quite a lot ,1
our experience at tenzan onsen in hakone   tattoo friendly,i searched the thread beforehand and didn te across this information but if i m in the wrong or it s inappropriate to post this please let me know my friends and i were searching for a tattoo friendly onsen in hakone after being refused entrance at the first onsen we went to  don t remember the name sorry  one of my friends has a prominent tattoo and he didn t want to  sneak in  like some people have said they do  we came across tenzan and were unsure if they d allow us in based on their website  it has unclear instructions regarding tattoos that make it seem they wouldn t allow them  but from the reviews it is very tourist friendly so we decided to simply try it and see what happened  upon arriving immediately my friend inquired about the tattoo  the clerk spoke english and said we were allowed to enter  all further doubts were put to rest once we entered the changing room and encountered others with prominent tattoos  so in short from our experience the tenzan onsen in hakone is tattoo  and foreignetourist  friendly  hopefully this information helps someone else if ever in a similar situation  our experience with tenzan beyond the tattoo policy was also positive  the shuttle from the station to there was ¥100 both ways  entrance was ¥1300 via vending machine ticket  towels were i think ¥560 for both small and large  small required  it was our first time visiting an onsen and the clerk was helpful and patient explaining everything to us  we visited shortly before dusk so the night fell as we bathed  the onsen was popular  we took to mean a good thing  and there seemed to be many locals as well as some foreigners  despite all the people it didn t feel overly crowded and we found bathing spots easily  we were very careful to follow all the etiquette and encountered no issues whatsoever  we came away refreshed and appreciative of the experience ,1
shinagawa or hamamatsucho ,my return flight from tokyo is scheduled at 10am  and i want to spend the night before in an area with easy access to haneda   shinagawa for the keikyu line and hamamatsucho for the tokyo monorail seem like the best options  do either of those neighborhoods have much going on nearby  i just want an area i can grab dinner  maybe a drink  and enjoy a chill last night in tokyo  i don t want to feel like i m in the middle of nowhere or an area that spletely void of life  would either of these locations work for that  also  in case someone suggests it  i d like to avoid taking the limousine bus so i don t have to factor in traffic ,1

advice with travel betweein nagoya   sapporo,so i ll be traveling across japan in early may on a 7 day railpass amp x200b i ve already mapped out the first 5 days  but now have 2 days on the railpass left  to fill with whatever makes sense i ll be starting out those 2 days in nagoya  and have to be in sapporo on the dayafter the railpass ends so my idea was to slowly make my way up to sapporo from nagoya  and stopping along the way to for some sightseeing   soaking in an onsen  as i don t necessarily want to spend the extradays in sapporo and am not too keen on being stuck on a train the entire day amp x200b so i thought i could split up that way up north by either spending a night inmorioka  aomori  or hakodate    day 6 of railpass  and then either travel onwards to sapporo on railpass day 7or stop again for the night somewhere and just buy a regular ticket for the last bit to sapporo the next day amp x200b what do you guys think morioka  aomori or hakodate   wich one does offer more for half a day of sightseeing also  is there anything on hokkaido along the way to sapporo that would be worth stopping for overnight  amp x200b thank you in advance for your input ,1
opinions on sotetsu fresa inn or apa hotel ,i would like some opinions on these two hotel chains and what would be best suited for a couple  we are staying for a total of 5 days in tokyo  specifically  i am stuck between deciding whether to go to   sotetsu fresa inn tokyo akasaka  or   apa hotel asakusa tawaramachi ekimae amp x200b the guest reviews on booking are fairly positive but both share the issue of it being quite small on some reviews  the soetsu chain advertise a room of 14m squared whilst apa rooms are usually 11 metres squared  however  the apa rooms look nicer or more modern amp x200b does anyone have any experience staying in these hotel rooms and can offer any thoughts  any advice would be appreciated ,1

hakone and mt fuji in september,after years of building up hype  i will arrive at haneda airport in the afternoon on the 7th of september one of the main reasons why i m taking this trip is hiking up mount fuji  before getting there though  i d like to stay at a ryokan in hakone as from what i ve read online it s one of the most rended locations for that so  my plan for now is the following  7th sep  gt  not sure if i should spend the night close to the airport or go straight to hakone  i would probably get to either place around 20 00  not worried about the jet lag  but 2 nights in a ryokan are quite expensive for my budget 8th sep  gt  explore hakone and the surrounding areas  then going for dinner at my aodation in the evening 9th sep  gt  go visit the spots i didn t get to the day before for the first half of the day  get to the yoshida trail 5th station  this is where i could use a little bit of help  as i will be relying on public transport  it seems that i would need to take a bus to kawaguchiko station first  then transfer to another one to get to the track  google maps doesn t really make things clearer  anyway  once i get there i will start climbing immediately  planning to rest for a few hours at a hut on the way up  getting on top just in time for the sunrise  10th sep  gt  climb down the mountain early in the morning and continue to kyoto pleaseent any suggestions you might have  or telling me my plan sucks and i should be doing something entirely different thank you ,1

are ramen street vendors consistent with not having egg in their noodles ,prior note  this question is about egg in the literal noodles  i know ramen typicallyes with a soft boiled egg  but i can easily ask to not have that my buddies and i are taking our first trip to japan in april and i unfortunately have an egg allergy  i know this is one of the allergies that japan calls out on packaging but reading through this sub   redacted from what i ve read  ramen noodles  shouldn t  be made with egg  and i would think that japan would be better at keeping this true to form  but for those that have spent extensive time in japan  is this the case  when i ve had ramen in the states  where i m from  the noodles usually have egg  so i just get rice noodles and don t get the soft boiled egg and i m good to go  i want to at least try some places but don t want to be disrespectful by ordering  testing the food  and having to not eat it because the noodles have egg randomly edit  i am planning on getting a laminated allergy card  but hope is to not be turned away due to my allergies  and i want to make sure to get my research right than throwing the allergy card around every time i eat last edit  people are really obsessed with the exact specifics of where i ll be eating ramen  that s on me for wording the question incorrectly  but damn do i not care  all i m really concerned with is if the general ramen shop restaurant space station hotel room dirt hovel is going to have egg in their noodles despite what google says what the  typical  recipe is  seems like it s a crapshoot  so i ll just stick to my allergy card and apologizing profusely for any inconvenience   signed  your friendly neighborhood naruto,1

rendations for manga museums in tokyo  or manga publishers that offer tours   or web sites that address this topic ,i am having a hard time finding anything but general information on where manga fans might want to visit  making it more difficult  i am definitely at a disadvantage by myself not being a manga fan  nor do i speak japanese  i just happen to be the adult helping a younger student with a project other than shopping in akihabara  i am having a hard time finding web site that seem to be written by  or include rendations from  manga fans that really know more than general stuff  i am looking for lesser known places that die hard fans know  places you are only going to find if you have made this kind of trip many times  amp  can really cut through the general touristy stuff to get to the unique jewels for example  i was able to track down the web site for gonzo animation studio japan  7 seeds  but the web site i found was in japanese  amp  i was unable to tell if they offered tours or had an area for guests to visit i think i am having a hard time because i simply do not know enough to know what terms to search for to sort through the non relevant information  for example  i searched the faq section here  found nothing on manga  i searched all of reddit for  manga travel  and i found a whole bunch of subreddits on manga that includes time travel as part of the storyline  but not so much on actual humans traveling irl    any hint on how to refine my search would also be greatly appreciated   thanks so much for any help ,1

advice for finding car culture tours or events for our tokyo trip,hi after a trip two years ago where my wife and i fell in love with japan  we are planning on returning in spring 2021 and bringing with us two relatives who in the past couple of years have developed a strong interest in japan  we are currently looking at a 7 10 day trip  largely split between kyoto and tokyo these two relatives  whom i will call matt and james  are deep into car culture   restoring miatas and nissans   and i would like to find a tour  or information on how we might be able to make a slice of our time in japan focused on cars on our last trip  we saw groups of go karts buzzing through the tokyo traffic with drivers dressed as mario or yoshi  this is a fun option we ll pursue regardless  but it doesn t answer the core interests of james or matt  though they laughed good naturedly and thumbed up the idea of the go karts  i lived for some time in the seattle area  and sunday mornings from may   oct at redmond town center were free exotic car shows  oftentimes including sir mix a lot and his orange lamborghini lp640  it was fairly easy as a redmond local to know that the show was an option  and i figure that there may be similar options in tokyo that locals are aware of  but would be harder for tourists to find does anyone have any suggestions on how i would pursue sorting out what might be reliably available so that i could arrange this japan trip  including sliding the trip date left or right to match  so that we get james and matt their car fix appreciate any thoughts or advice ,1

january 2020 trip report,hey everyone  i feel like the trip reports i read before going to japan were really helpful  so i thought i d post my trip report too  i tried to go into detail about the different things we did  but pleaseent if you have any questions trip album general advice  i would highly rend ordering a suica card beforehand  or downloading the suica app on your phone  this way you can use it on the train when you get off the plane  instead of having to find an atm to withdraw cash to purchase a ticket  i was able to order a suica card at the same time that i ordered my japan rail pass  internet was incredibly helpful  both with directions and looking up information about attractions  i have sprint which has free lte in japan  and i had full bars almost everywhere  including small cities  mountains  hiking trails  etc  use japan official travel app  not google maps  especially outside of tokyo  japanese isn t needed  pointing and hand symbols  numbers for example  are enough  it would ve been more useful to be able to read japanese since some menus  especially at food stands  weren t in english  credit cards were accepted in about half the places i would go to  they aren t accepted in some places i would expect  chain cafes in cities  so make sure you have cash   7 11 wasn t ason as i thought  it s good to get cash out when you see one  suica worked on almost all public transportation  a couple didn t take it  but it was usually pretty clear beforehand and there was an office you could buy tickets nearby   bathrooms are everywhere  but they often don t have soap and or towels  hand sanitizer was really helpful here  trash cans are nowhere  it was a little more bearable though because you re supposed to eat next to the place where you bought your food  so you can hand your food trash to them after you finish 1 17  tokyo  ginza    sushi dai    tsukiji market  grapefruit juice  matcha ice cream  daifuku  red bean paste with strawberries  a happy pancake ginza  kabukiza theatre  ueno park  tokyo national museum  department store takoyaki    ramen mutekiyawe got in the night before  and in the morning we woke up early to go to sushi dai  the sushi was amazing  definitely rend  be aware of the wait   we got there at 6 30am and ended up eating around 8am  the wait was inside though  so it wasn t as bad as i thought it d be  something to note   there s not much for tourists in the toyosu market so you ll probably just go to the restaurant and leave next we went to tsukiji market  which was really cool to walk around and see the different things people are selling  there was one street that was much more populated than the others with prepared food and drinks  next we had lunch at a happy pancake ginza  these pancakes were much more fluffy than american pancakes  and they were delicious we walked over to kabukiza theatre  which was a really interesting and unique cultural experience  we didn t realize there were english translations we could buy until halfway through the show  i feel like those would ve made it more enjoyable  after the show we walked to tokyo station to get our jr pass and book our reservations  the japan official travel app was really useful here because we were able to star the route for the reservations that we booked  we messed up initially by booking reservations from the departing station to the last station on the route and had to redo most of our reservations to only book to our arrival station we took the train to ueno and walked briefly through ueno park to get to the tokyo national museum  it was mostly pottery and other art artifacts which were interesting to look at  but it felt like a pretty typical museum  finally we went to ikebukuro to get ramen at mutekiya  we got a takoyaki snack at a department store underneath the station  this was another long wait  about an hour  and this time it was outside  the ramen was worth it though  the pork and broth in particular were incredible 1 18  yudanaka  cookie and granola  imperial east gardens  salmon sashimi  strawberry banana crepe  train to yudanaka   check in at ryokan  vegetarian wrap    snow monkeys    dinner at ryokan  plum wine  sashimi  hot pot    onsenour ryokan was only able to pick us up from yudanaka station at check in time  1pm  so we hung out in tokyo in the morning  we dropped our stuff off at tokyo station at a luggage locker since we only needed to take a backpack to yudanaka  not the full carry on  we then tried to get breakfast  but almost nothing was open at this time  9 30am  we ended up getting a cookie and granola at a coffee shop next we walked over to the imperial east gardens  i feel like these would ve been more impressive in the summer  also  some of the trails were closed and we had to get back for the train so we were only able to see a pretty limited amount  after that went to tokyo station to go to yudanaka  in the basement we got a salmon sashimi on rice bowl and a strawberry banana crepe  the sashimi was amazing  especially for a small store in the basement of the train station  on our way to yudanaka  we had a pretty tight transfer to the nagano dentetsu train  we didn t know that we couldn t use the suica here  so we had to quickly buy a ticket at the machine then get on the train  we made it on arrival at yudanaka station  we took the shuttle to our ryokan and checked in  they had us take off our shoes at the entrance to put on their slippers  and we took off those slippers  on entering our room  our room was a traditional japanese style room  there was just a table  2 chairs on the ground  and a blanket underneath the table in the room our ryokan offered a ride to the monkey park  so we went there next  we had a vegetarian wrap before starting the hike to the park  which was fairly average  there was about a 30 minute hike to the park  partially the reason it took so long was we had to walk slowly because of the ice  when we got to the monkey park  we were amazed by the number of monkeys and how close they got to you  one baby monkey even stepped on my shoe  it was also really cool to see them lounge in the onsen outside we took the bus back to the ryokan  which was pretty simple to navigate  again  they don t take suica so make sure you buy a ticket at the booth before getting on the bus  on getting back to the ryokan we discovered the table had a heater underneath  the table had a heater underneath it which was really nice to sit and relax for a little bit after the park  next we had a multiple course dinner at the ryokan  i thought this would beunal  but it was actually a private dinner  there was an ordered list for the food  so we followed that  my favorite dish was the sashimi and the hot pot with pork after dinner we took a brief nap  they set up our beds during dinner  then went out to the onsen  hot springs spa  we just wore the yukata and shoes provided by the ryokan  similar to clogs  this was a great and unique experience  especially in the cold  we planned to go to all 9 public onsen  but they were pretty similar and we were tired so we headed back to the ryokan after 5  we actually didn t end up using the ryokan s onsen  but they had an onsen outside as well which would ve been nice to use 1 19  tokyo  shibuya shinjuku  breakfast at ryokan  miso  carmelized fish  apple pie baked good   train to tokyo  hachiko statue  shubuya crossing  center gai    nabezo shabu shabu sukiyaki  yoyogi park  meiji shrine     samurai museum    golden gai  ace s  wagyu gyukatsu  mister donutwe had breakfast at the ryokan  which again was multiple courses  i really enjoyed the miso soup and carmelized fish that they gave us  next we walked around yudanaka  and we got a baked good that resembled a mini apple pie with walnuts at a bakery  really good  we went back to the ryokan to take their shuttle to yudanaka station we took the train to tokyo station  picked up our bags  then went to shinjuku station to drop off our bags at the hotel then headed out  we headed over to lunch and stopped at a couple places on the way  the hachiko statue and shibuya crossing are right in front of the station  then we walked through center gai  which was really interesting to see all the advertisements  at times it felt overwhelming with all the lights and sounds happening from all directions  but it was definitely something to see since it s so unique to tokyo we went to nabezo  a shabu shabu sukiyaki restaurant  to have lunch  this was all you can eat for 100 minutes  we didn t expect to stay that long  but it was so good we stayed basically the maximum time  it was similar to hot pot where there is a boiling broth at the table  and you submerge raw meat to cook it  they give you soy sauce  sesame sauce  and a spicy sauce to dip the meat in after cooking  the waitress came over to help us initially which was helpful for figuring out what to do  we got shabu shabu and kimchi broth  and both were amazing  they have vegetables and rice and noodles to add to the broth as well  at the end they had ice cream with a couple flavors  black bean was my favorite  we got the cheapest option  2800 yen  and it was more than worth it next we walked through yoyogi park  meiji shrine was closing soon so we didn t stay too long at the park  but there was a festival going on with performances and people selling food which was fun  also on our way to the shrine we saw a group of people dressed up as 50s greasers dancing which was cool to see the meiji shrine was very impressive  we really enjoyed the walk to and from the shrine on the trail with trees on both sides  it was pretty crowded and it actually was closing right after we arrived  but we were still able to walk around and enjoy the buildings next we walked over to the samurai museum  the museum s area had a bunch of ads for  massages  and other panionship  but it never felt dangerous  the museum itself was really interesting  a tour was starting right as we walked in  so we joined that  i d highly rend taking the tour  which was free  since they go into much more detail about the things in the museum than the signs do  the tour was great because it explained both history of samurai  as well as some history of japan as a whole after the museum we walked to the golden gai  it seemed pretty empty when we went  around 7pm  but we saw a small bar with a sign in english so we went there  the bartender was very friendly  and we talked with him and the other patrons for a while  it was mostly non japanese people in the bar  but there was also a  very drunk  japanese man who came in shortly after we arrived  the bar was very small with only about 8 seats  so it was a very cozy atmosphere  we got a beer  plum wine  sake  negroni  and soju  probably could ve done without the negroni and soju we met a couple from america as well  and we went to get a late night snack with them  we had wagyu gyukatsu at a restaurant near the bar  and after we got donuts at a nearby mister donuts 1 20  hakone  breaded chicken sandwiches  train to hakone  walk to pirate ship  view of fuji  pirate ship across lake  view of fuji    ropeway to owakudani  view of fuji  black eggs  black curry bread  ropeway and pirate ship back across lake  soba noodles  hakone shrinewe woke up  slightly hungover  and went to the train station to go to hakone  we ended up having to take the train with our luggage during rush hour  which was very packed  it actually wasn t as bad as i expected since nobody pushed people into the train  but everybody was squished together  we stored luggage at the shinagawa station and got a beef cutlets sandwich while waiting for our shinkansen  the sandwich was just okay  definitely one of our worse meals we took the shinkansen to odawara and got the hakone free pass there  we took the train to hakone yumoto station then a bus to our hotel to drop off our bags  after that we walked to the moto hakone port  on the way  there was a great view of mt  fuji  we were very lucky that it was perfectly clear  so we got a great view  we then took the pirate ship cruise to the togendai port  then we transferred to the ropeway to go to owakudani at owakudani we walked around a little bit and got black eggs and black curry bread at a store near the station  unfortunately all the hiking trails were closed so we were just able to view the smoke from near the station  we took the last leg of the cable car to sounzan  and we got to get a better view of the smoke and sulfur on the way  we then took the cable car back down to togendai and the pirate ship back to moto hakone after we got off the ship  we went to a small soba noodles restaurant near the port  we got beef soba  and the noodles and broth were delicious  we then went to the hakone shrine  even though the shrine was much smaller than meiji  there were manyonalities between the two  the general layout  offerings  gates  we then headed back to the hotel  taking the ancient cedar avenue which ran alongside the road  we then went to the onsen in the hotel and called it an early night 1 21  tokyo  asakusa odaiba  train to tokyo     7 11 fried chicken  okonomiyaki with soba  kaminarimon gate  nakamise dori  sensoji temple  dempoin  shin nakamise  custard taiyaki  river cruise to hama rikyu    hama rikyu garden    teamlab planets  dockcity  katsu with curry  takoyaki  sea salt ice creamwhile heading back to tokyo  we stopped at the 7 11 in odawara station and picked up a fried chicken stick  it was really good  almost like chick fil a nuggets  we took the train to tokyo station to drop off our bags for the door  and we stopped for lunch in the basement  we got okonomiyaki with soba noodles  it was almost like an omelette with eggy pancakes on the outside and soba noodles in the inside  we also got to use an ordering machine where you order the food in a machine before entering the restaurant  then you show the staff the ticket next we headed to asakusa for the sensoji temple  we went through the kaminarimon gate and walked through nakamise dori with all the vendors on both sides  sensoji temple was pretty large  with multiple beautiful halls and shrines  we spent some time there  then went down dempoin and shin nakamise  we had thought that dempoin was supposed to be similar to an  old town  tokyo street  but it seemed fairly similar to the other streets  regardless  it was fun to look at all the shops  and we got a custard taiyaki that was delicious next we headed to the tokyo cruise pier to take a ship down to hama rikyu gardens  the ride itself was pretty uneventful  especially since the tour guide mainly spoke in japanese  however  once we go there the gardens were beautiful  the garden was initially built by the shogun in the 1600s  and there were several reconstructed buildings in the style of that era  you could walk in the buildings and they had some information on their purpose  also  it was very interesting to see the traditional gardens with the skyscrapers in the background  the gardens were peaceful to walk around after the fairly crowded and noisy asakusa area we then took the elevated train to teamlab planets  this was a very unique experience  unlike anything i ve done before  there were several rooms  each with a different theme and purpose  there was also an app that allowed you to interact with a couple rooms through the app  for example  in one room there s a simulation of flowers and butterflies  and you can use the app to send new butterflies into the simulation  i would highly rend going to this  definitely one of the highlights of the trip next we wanted to check out the uniqlo  so we headed over to divercity  we stopped for dinner at the food court  we got a chicken katsu with curry  presentation was lacking  but it was surprisingly good  a takoyaki  delicious  and a sea salt ice cream  blue for some reason  but very good  we shopped at uniqlo for a little bit  tax free  then headed back to the hotel 1 22  kyoto  northern  chicken mcmuffin  red bean pastries  shinkansen to kyoto    gyukatsu  kinkakuji temple  matcha cheesecake    ryoanji temple  nishiki market  rice balls with soy sauce   pontocho alley  tsukemen  chicken fried rice  matcha ice cream my friend on the trip left in the morning  so i was solo traveling for the rest of the trip  first time  i started the morning early going to the jr narita station  it turns out it was a little too early since i had about 30 minutes to kill until my train  the only restaurant that was open was mcdonald s  so i stopped in for a chicken mcmuffin  not bad  i wandered around and noticed a bakery open  and i got a pastry with red bean which was very good i took the shinkansen to kyoto  then i went to the hostel to drop off my bags  next i went to get lunch at a gyukatsu restaurant  this was delicious  even better than when we got gyukatsu on 1 19  part of the reason it was so good was there were multiple sauces you could use  including soy sauce and wasabi  worcester sauce and sesame  japanese salt and pepper  soft boiled egg  and curry  my favorite sauce was the soy sauce and wasabi  after i finished i had some soft boiled egg left  and the woman working there suggested that i add the soft boiled egg to the rice  which was very good next i went to kinkakuji temple  i got a little lost trying to take the bus to the temple  i found that google maps wasn t very accurate for kyoto  so i decided to use the japan official travel app for kyoto public transportation  this temple was beautiful  especially the reflection of the buildings in the pond  it was pretty crowded though  which made it a little difficult to enjoy fully  i stopped at a bakery for matcha cheesecake on my way to ryoan ji temple i enjoyed ryoan ji temple much more than kinkakuji  probably partly because it was much less crowded  i especially liked the zen garden  where there are 15 stones in the garden but you can only see 14 at a time  i walked around the temple gardens for a while  then headed to nishiki market i walked through nishiki market  and i got rice balls covered with sweet soy sauce  i didn t like these too much since i felt like they were too sweet  next i walked to pontocho alley to wander through the row of restaurants  i ended up going to a small ramen place and had a set that included tsukemen  chicken fried rice  and matcha ice cream  i had never had tsukemen before  and i really enjoyed the broth  mine didn te with an egg  which i missed  after dinner i headed back to the hostel to do some laundry and go to sleep 1 23  kyoto  eastern  baked good with jelly  ginkakuji temple    philosopher s path    honen in temple  nazenji temple  keage incline  heian shrine  yasaka shrine    crab stick with mayo and chili powder  boiled dumplings  kodaiji temple  higashiyama streets  matcha latte bubble tea  kiyomizu dera temple    fushimi inari shrine  chicken skewer with teriyaki    bar  izakaya  meat skewersthis day was mostly seeing temples and shrines  it was raining all day  so i think that contributed to the relatively few people at the temples  i really enjoyed all the temples  especially the zen gardens at most of the temples  i particularly enjoyed the honen in temple  which i wandered into while on the philosopher s path between ginkakuji and nazenji  there was nobody else in honen in when i went  which definitely added to the experience i wanted to go to izuu or izuju in gion for sushi  but they had very long lines  instead  i got a crab stick with mayo and chili powder and boiled dumplings from food stands outside yasaka shrine  the crab stick especially was delicious  i didn t expect that it would be so good i also enjoyed walking through the streets in higashiyama and seeing all the shops  there were a ton of matcha flavored foods all over kyoto  i didn t know it at the time  but kyoto is one of the biggest producers of green tea around 4 30 i went to the fushimi inari shrine  even though there was a pretty big crowd  it was still amazing to see all the gates  i had seen pictures of the shrine before  but seeing the scale and density was incredible  i hiked up to the intersection with the view of kyoto in time for sunset  then headed back down  i got a chicken skewer with teriyaki at a food stand nearby  which was really good afterwards i went near pontocho alley to a small bar called bar dram  i arrived soon after they opened  and i was the only person in the bar the entire time  the bartender was very friendly  and we talked about kyoto and japan in general  he gave me some sake to try which was amazing  it was sweet and caramel flavored  it was a great experience  and i especially liked getting to learn more about kyoto and japan from someone who lives there  after the bar  i went to a nearby izakaya that he rended  then i headed back to the hostel 1 24  kyoto  arashiyama  shrimp yuba     bamboo grove  tenryuji temple  togetsukyo bridge  monkey park  okonomiyaki bar    sushi naritaya  jojakkoji temple via bamboo grove  giouji temple  saga toriimoto street  saga toriimoto archive hall  otagi nenbutsuji temple  daikakuji temple  nishiki market  brewery  french fries with japanese pepper and japanese pickled vegetables  coffee shop  cheesecake  curryi started the day by going to the bamboo grove in arashiyama  stopping at a food stand for shrimp yuba along the way  not my favorite  the bamboo grove was amazing  especially because there were only a couple people there when i arrived around 8 30  similar to fushimi inari  i had seen pictures of the bamboo grove before but being able to see it in person was incredible i continued to see the tenryu ji temple  beautiful  then to the togetsukyo bridge then the monkey park  the monkey park was very cool  but i felt like it would ve been more impressive if i hadn t done the snow monkey park last week  getting to feed the monkeys was definitely a great experience though after this i stopped at a food stand to get an okonomiyaki bar  which is just okonomiyaki on a stick  would rend  then i stopped for lunch at sushi naritaya which had just opened  i had one of their sushi sets and plum wine  the sushi was amazing  definitely one of my favorite meals on the trip  i especially liked the eel that was included in the set next i saw a couple more temples in arashiyama  between the temples  i stopped at the saga toriimoto archive hall since it was open and free  they had a panorama of a historical representation of the street which was pretty cool to see  out of all the temples today  the otagi nenbutsuji was definitely the most unique  there were tons of stone heads everywhere in the relatively small temple grounds  it s also fairly out of the way  so there was only one other couple there after the temples  i went to nishiki market to wander around since many stores were closed when i went 2 days ago  next i went to a nearby brewery for a drink and an order of french fries and japanese pickled vegetables  i especially liked the japanese pepper that was served with the french fries  i had a cheesecake at a coffee shop while waiting for kara kusa curry to open  i had the red and black curry mixture  which i felt was good but not amazing  then went back to the hotel 1 25  nara osaka  chocolate belgian waffle  sweets at cafe  train to nara    nara park  todaiji temple  daibutsuden  nigatsudo  custard taiyaki     udon with shrimp tempura  train to osaka    osaka museum of housing and living  fried chicken cup  osaka castle    osaka museum of history  dotonbori  katsu  melonpan with matcha ice cream  hozenji temple    jazz bar  onseni started off the day by getting a chocolate belgian waffle and some sweets at a cafe at a train station in kyoto  before getting on a train to nara  i walked around nara park for a couple hours  it was very cool seeing all the deer  i had been to a couple monkey parks on the trip  but this felt different because this was a public park  as well as the large number of deer  i checked out todaiji temple  and the daibutsuden hall was especially cool to see based on its size i grabbed a custard taiyaki on my way back  but it wasn t as good as the one i had a couple days ago  i stopped at a restaurant near the train station to get udon noodles with shrimp tempura  the noodles and shrimp were delicious  but i especially liked the broth next i took a train to osaka  i dropped off my bags at the capsule hotel then headed to the museum of living and housing  which has a recreation of osaka in the edo period  i love history museums and historical re enactments  so i really liked this museum  i got the audio guide  which gave more information on what exactly i was seeing  being able to walk into the houses and really see what they looked in the edo period was amazing  they also had a brief period where they lowered the lights to emulate night  which was pretty cool as well after that i headed to osaka castle  stopping for a fried chicken cup nearby  i didn t go into the main hall itself  but i still enjoyed seeing the grounds and the different buildings from the outside  i walked back out and headed to the nearby museum of history  i really enjoyed this museum  especially the great view of osaka castle and all the dioramas of different periods of history  i also liked the ar display of the naniwa palace so you can get an idea of what it looked like in relation to the modern day city  i got the audio tour here as well  but it probably wasn t needed as much since an english summary of information was available on most important displays  next i went to dotonbori street to walk around  this street seemed much bigger and populated than the other shopping streets i ve seen  i really liked walking around and people watching  as well as looking at all the lights everywhere  i stopped at a restaurant for some pork katsu  i got one that had half katsu sauce and half miso based sauce  the miso sauce was delicious  i had never had anything like that before  after dinner i stopped at a stand to get melonpan with matcha ice cream  this was very good  especially the crispy outside of the melonpan  i briefly stopped at the hozenji temple  then headed to a nearby jazz bar  this was a very small bar where the owner would play jazz vinyl records from an extensive collection  i had a couple drinks here and sat for a while enjoying the atmosphere  then i headed back to my capsule hotel this was my first time doing a capsule hotel  and it was surprisingly enjoyable  the hotel i chose had an onsen  so it was almost like a spa  all the facilities were very nice  the only issue i had was the capsule bed itself was a little too thin  and i hit the sides a couple times with my arms while sleeping  also  the provided locker was fairly small  so you had to keep your luggage on a rack which was accessible to everyone  these weren t a big deal though  and i still really enjoyed my stay  unfortunately  this specific capsule hotel is converting to a female only hotel next month so i won t be able to stay there again  but i d definitely be open to staying at another capsule hotel again 1 26  miyajima  banana soy muffin  melonpan  chicken and rice box  train and ferry to miyajima    itsukushima jinja shrine  daisho in temple    grilled oysters  momiji manju with custard  momijidani park    ropeway to mt  misen  hike down mt  misen  momiji manju with red bean  miyajima de gansu  sushii headed to the train station to go to miyajima  stopping for some breakfast on the way  the train to hiroshima and the port was pretty uneventful  but the ferry ride to miyajima was beautiful since it was very nice out  i dropped off my bags at the hotel  then i went to the itsukushima jinja shrine  unfortunately the gate in the water was under construction so it had a sheet over it  but the shrine was still amazing to see  this shrine was different from the other ones i ve seen since it was on the water  and at low tide it looked like it was floating on the water next i went to the daisho in temple  this temple was also different from others i ve seen since it was in the mountains  so it had a more remote feel  i explored here a while  then headed back to the village for lunch  i had grilled oysters for lunch  which were amazing  i don t normally like oysters  but i read they were a speciality on the island and i m very glad that i tried them  i stopped for momiji manju with custard on my way out  these are maple leaf sweets with some filling in them  similar to the taiyaki  this was very good  especially since it was warm next i walked to momijidani park and walked around there for a while  this was very peaceful  and there was even a pond with some koi fish  nearby was the ropeway to go up mt  misen  the views from the ropeway and the top station were beautiful  but what was amazing were the views from the summit of mt  misen  about 20 minute walk from the top station  looking at hiroshima city on one side and the islands on the other city was amazing  and it was definitely one of my favorite parts of the trip i hiked down mt  misen which was mostly through the forest  i stopped for another momiji manju in the village  which wasn t as good either because of the red bean or it wasn t warm  i stopped for miyajima de gansu at a food stand  which is a deep fried fish and onion stick similar to a fish stick  i didn t understand the machine ordering process and a woman working there helped me  which was very nice  i went back to the hotel to rest for a little bit  then i headed back out to dinner i got sushi at a nearby restaurant which was delicious  but probably not my favorite from this trip  then i walked around miyajima for a while  the lanterns and the shrine  which was lit up at night  were very peaceful after a long day  then i headed back to the hotel 1 27  hiroshima  ferry  train  tram to hiroshima    peace memorial museum  bagel  peace park  cenotaph  children s peace monument  atomic bomb memorial mound    atomic bomb dome  okonomiyaki     orizuru tower  hot lemonade  orange cake  hiroshima castle  shukkei en garden  tsukemen  chicken karaage  crepe with banana and chocolate    koba bari started the day by traveling back to hiroshima city  it was raining outside so the trip wasn t as nice as the trip to miyajima  i did enjoy taking the tram within hiroshima city though  i dropped off my bags at the hotel  then i headed to the peace memorial museum to beat the crowds  the museum was incredibly moving  and i thought it was really well done  i felt like whenever i had a question about something  the next section of the museum would answer that  for example  at one point i was wondering about the survivors of the bomb  then the next section was dedicated to that topic  also  i appreciated how the museum was mostly  heartbreaking  personal testimonials which made you really understand the level of impact that the bomb had on this city and the citizens after the museum i stopped for a bagel at a nearby bagel shop  most of the bagels actually didn te with cream cheese and they didn t have separate cream cheese which i thought was interesting  next i went back to the peace park to see a couple monuments  at this point it had starting raining pretty heavily so i didn t spend too much time there  but all the monuments were very touching especially the children s peace monument which is dedicated to the children who died in the bomb next i went to the atomic bomb dome in the park  which is the foundation of a building near the hypocenter of the bomb  much of the foundation was left standing  including parts of the dome on top of the building  the building is preserved to how it looked like after the bomb  including pieces of wreckage around the building  having the building look the same as in pictures of the aftermath of the bomb really drove home the impact of the bomb on the city and the people s lives then i went to grab lunch at a nearby okonomiyaki restaurant  i had a little difficult finding it since it was underground  but i m really glad i did since it was delicious  and pretty cheap  after that i went back to near the park to go up the orizuru tower  it was a little expensive for what it was  but i thought it was really nice  the observation deck had great views of the park and especially of the atomic bomb dome  i got a hot lemonade  pretty good  and orange cake  not as good  at the cafe on the floor  one floor below you could make an origami crane and release it with other cranes that people have made  it was definitely a nice activity to do while waiting out the rain at this point the rain had slowed down  so i went to hiroshima castle  the grounds were nice  and the castle was very impressive  i went inside the castle since i had some time  but it was more like a pretty small history museum than a castle  after that i walked to shukkei en garden  i really enjoyed walking around this garden  especially getting to learn about the reconstruction efforts for the garden next i headed back to the hotel to rest for a little bit  then i went to dinner  i got tsukemen and chicken karaage  i enjoyed the tsukemen  but i think i like the hot broth more  i thought the chicken karaage was very good though  i walked around the shopping streets for a while  stopping for a crepe at a shop  i appreciate how portable and easy to eat the crepes are since they re in an ice cream cone shape after that i headed to koba bar soon after it opened  i really liked this bar  and i m very glad i went here to end my last full day in japan  they play american rock music with a projection of the music video on the wall  the bartenders are very friendly  and i talked with them and a couple of the other people at the bar for a while  i had already eaten  but the food looked delicious as well  especially the chili carbonara  after about an hour there  i headed back to the hotel since i had to be up early the next day to travel back to tokyo for my flight ,1

traveling from takayama to shizuoka by bus via nagoya,just confirming if i read the tables right  based on this schedule for  the shoryudo bus pass  and  this bus time table    there s no direct bus to shizuoka station from nagoya station  taking a bus means getting off the tomei shizuoka bus stop then taking another bus to shizuoka station  super liner 64  66  or 68 are probably the best midday buses to ride if i want to arrive in shizuoka with a bit of daylight left and i ming from takayama stationas a small aside  assuming i got everything right  by the time i head to shizuoka have i hit roi for the jpy8500 shoryudo 3 day pass thanks ,1

spend 4 nights in oita or aso area  or both  what did you love and why ,this sub has a ton of info about tokyo osaka kyoto  but not nearly as much on the oita aso regions  looking to hear more from people that have been there  we ll be in the oita aso region for 4 nights with a rental car  debating spending 2 nights in aso oita or 4 nights in both  this is a fairly outdoorsy trip  although we do love big cities like osaka   oita seems busier and more touristy but you can get really cool rental houses with in house private onsens  whereas in aso  you can get really neat mountain side cabins that are still within driving distance  plans are to see takachiho for one day trip  and then a random mix of taketa  harajino falls  usuki  nabegataki falls  aso mountain  maybe beppu yufuin  and other nearby hikes depending on the day  no pressure to fit it all in  what did you like most about each area  bonus if you re also outdoorsy edit  also going in mid  april ,1

 help mark  for tourists visiting japan,hey  so some of you may know of the japanese  help mark  which looks like a red tag with a cross and a heart on it  it was made for people with invisible disabilities to wear in japanese public transport as an indicator to let others know to take extra care and give up their seat for anyone displaying the  help mark i know  from   that you can get a help mark from many places  but my question is whether or not this tag is only for japanese citizens  or if i  as a tourist visiting for a couple of weeks am able to obtain one thanks  ,1
review of two very different types of aodation in kyoto,the last time i traveled to japan for a decent amount of time  i had a lot of time and no money   i spent several weeks exploring the country and had a great time  but i probably missed out on some good experiences because my main motive was to save   most of the aodation i stayed in was splitting a budget hotel with my friend  or staying in capsule hotels this time  i had a lot less time and a lot more money   while frugality is still a big part of my life  i have changed my ways and am willing to spend more on a good experience that is  worth it   this has also reflected in the types of hotels i book   while several years ago i would always go for the cheapest hostel on the internet  now i go for hotels that may not be the most fancy  but are clean fortable  staffed by nice people  and where i have my own toilet   despite this maturation  i couldn t resist when i saw a place that billed itself as a  luxury capsule hotel  for around ¥1300 per night in kyoto  when regular hotels were going for around ¥5000   i thought  it s japan  can t be too bad  so took the offer  and checked into the first cabin arashiyama   i had booked a  business class  cabin  which is basically a capsule that s decently wider and taller than a normal one   there were clothes hangars  a safe inside  and you could almost stand on the bed if you really wanted to   there is also a  first class  cabin  which was almost like a tiny room  with space to walk around and a larger bed  they also provided pajamas  daily toiletries  and daily housekeeping   the bathrooms and toilets were much cleaner than those you would find in a european or southeast asian youth hostel  and the toilets were the nice japanese style with automatic and heated seats   there was even a public bath  as well as separate areas to shower privately  and wash your face brush your teeth   the hotel was located on top of the randen arashiyama station  close to major attractions and convenient for transportation   there was also an outdoor lounge on top  where you could watch the trainse and go  and there was a nice view of kyoto   would i stay there again   definitely for a period of time up to 3 days   i could see myself getting a little tired of it if i stayed there longer though  i wanted to stay in kyoto for another night  so i used a hyatt free night certificate to book a room at the new park hyatt kyoto  across the town in higashiyama   i must confess  i somewhat planned my trip around using that certificate   and considering the hotel was around ¥100k per night after taxes  i think i got a pretty good deal   i didn t make it to higashiyama until around 7 pm   all the attractions and shops close around 5 pm  so when i got there it was very surreal  although i knew it was a popular tourist area  i felt like i was walking in traditional japan with literally nobody else around   walking around in the park hyatt  i felt like i was walking through a futuristic version of an imperial palace  lots of automatic sliding doors  lots of gardens  lots of traditional architecture   the designers tried very hard to make the building fit in in that neighborhood   after being served aplimentary cup of green tea while checking in  they brought me up to my room  which overlooked the whole city of kyoto  including hokan ji  which was very impressive in this neighborhood of low rise buildings   closer to the room  i could see a very pretty building within theplex that i later found out was kyoyamato  a famed kaiseki restaurant  who also catered breakfast   after checking in  i went to walk around the neighborhood  and grabbed a class of whiskey at the bar  a very intimate place with a beautiful view and a bartender who took his job more seriously than any i have seen in the world   upon returning to my room  i found that they had left me a delicious piece of chocolate and a basket of strawberries   in the morning i grabbed breakfast   they had a japanese option catered by kyoyamato  or a western option in their other restaurant  so of course i chose the japanese option   everything was presented perfectly  as expected at a nice japanese restaurant   even the rice came uncooked  with a flame under it so that it would be perfectly fresh when i ate it   the amount of sauce provided was exactly enough to perfectly season the main dish   and the dessert was a single strawberry   i think it shows true confidence that you could serve a single strawberry and know it will be fantastic   would i stay at the park hyatt again   i would love to   will i ever actually stay there again   i would love to get to the point in my life where i could drop ¥100k per night on a hotel  but unfortunately i m not there yet   when checking out  the gentleman at the front desk asked why i only stayed one night  i didn t have the heart to tell him i didn t want to spend that much to stay longer   so there you have it   i stayed at two hotels in kyoto  atpletely opposite ends of the spectrum price  and ammenities wise   i had a great time at both  and would rend them both in an instant to anyone seeking aodation in their respective price ranges ,1

is it too cold to swim in the pacific during november ,going to japan for two weeks this november  13 26th  and i will be visiting numazu to get away from the big cities and enjoy some seaside views of mt fuji  i am very keen on swimming in japan  from what i ve read  shizuoka doesn t get too cold and is mostly a warm maritime climate on the coast however  i know that the pacific can get pretty cold where i m from  east coast of australia  despite the climate and i will be going mid november so i m hesitant i will be doing onsens  guaranteed  but i don t think onsens will be enough to satisfy my craving to go swimming  i don t want to miss out on an opportunity to experience the ocean in another part of the world  but i don t want to get sick either has anyone went swimming in the pacific during late autumn  or knows a resource i can look at so i can get a basic understanding  would it be risky  thanks ,1
itinerary check  tokyo   osaka   kumano kodo   kyoto   akita,hello  this will be my second time in japan  first time solo travelling  26m  i am basically doing a sanity check on my skeleton itinerary  and looking for any transport inefficiencies  with some specific questionslooking for some downtime for self reflection and seeing the country side  nature  hiking  and having some fun socialising with fellow backpackers   eating  drinking  bit of typical site seeing my specific questions surrounding my itinerary are 1  i am relatively fit  okay maybe slightly under average  do you think the kumano kodo hike will be doable  i enjoy challenging myself  however i do not want to bite off too much and end up relying on external help 2  i found a really nice onsen   village that i would love to try  i am looking for that rural mountain vibe to relax in  is the trip to akita for a two night stay feasible  or am i just crazy  i don t mind it being out of the way  and enjoy the long train rides 3  is there anything you feel i would be missing out on in and around akita  perhaps i could knock off some days elsewhere to make room  i am not married to the idea of kumano kodo   i just really like the idea of a multi day hike through temples or lush japanese forest   that isn t too strenuous  with the ability to stay at aodation at night  would there be similar hiking trails in the north  keeping in mind that i will be going in mid march so the snow might be a problem amp x200b mar 2  tokyo  leave perth 6 00am  arrive tokyo  haneda  9 15pm  lodging  tokyo k s house amp x200b mar 3  tokyo  teamlab planet  edo museum  sumida aquarium   really into my aquascaping  it s a shame the ada gallery in niigata isn t open as i would definitely be going  lodging  tokyo k s house amp x200b mar 4  tokyo  ghibli museum  tickets booked  any other rendations for this day  lodging  tokyo k s house amp x200b mar 5  osaka  shinkansen to osaka  rest during the day  dotonburi amp x200b mar 6  osaka  forward backpack to kyoto amp x200b mar 7   yunomine onsen  begin kumano kodo trail  9am train to kii tannabe and the bus to hongu  hike to yunomine onsen amp x200b mar 8  koguchi  take bus to ukegawa  hike to koguchi amp x200b mar 9   kii katsuura  hike to nachi san  bus to kii katsuura amp x200b mar 10  kyoto  train back to kyoto  haven t planned kyoto out yet  but i imagine i can easily find things to fill my days with  probably some temples and a bike ride amp x200b mar 11  kyoto amp x200b mar 12  kyoto amp x200b mar 13  kyoto  morning trip to nara before heading back to tokyo  shinkansen back to tokyo amp x200b mar 14  tokyo  free day amp x200b mar 15  akita  shinkansen to akita  tazawako station  bus to tsuru no yu  lodging  ryokan tsurunoyu onsen  pending amp x200b mar 16  akita  lodging  ryokan tsurunoyu onsen  pending  bus down to tazawako lake or do some hiking amp x200b mar 17  tokyo  bus back to tazawako station  shinkansen back to tokyo  left this part of tokyo blank for now  hopefully i ll be able to catch the cherry blossom amp x200b mar 18  tokyo amp x200b mar 19  tokyo amp x200b mar 20  leave tokyo 10 45am  ,1

i need help deciding between kawaguchiko or kamakura day trip,hi everyone  i ll be in japan next week from the 14th  until the 21st and i ll be staying in tokyo  i originally wanted to go to kawaguchiko lake for a day trip just to see mt  fuji  there isn t anything else in the area that my husband and i are excited to see except for mt fuji  the weather is showing that it ll be mostly cloudy rainy on the days we can go  either the 17th  18th  or 20th  though i know this will change as it gets closer  but i am afraid that if i book my tickets for the highway bus  about  80 usd for my husband and i  and spend the two hours to travel to the lake  we just won t end up seeing it  i looked into other places that might be a better day trip and kamakura seems very interesting  we are only staying a week in tokyo and i would ve loved to visit kyoto  and i heard kamakura is similar to kyoto  plus in february i read they have a beautiful peony garden at  tsurugaoka hachiman gu and peonies are my favorite flower lol   i would feel bad about not seeing mt  fuji since that is a pretty big part of japan  but i also don t want to waste precious vacation time if it ll be hidden behind clouds when we arrive i guess my question would be what would you do  those of you that have been to both places what do you think is a better day trip in this situation  thank you edit  thank you everyone for you reents  it still feels like a tie between the two but i think we re going to go with kamakura as i know i will enjoy it even if it s cloudy  and maybe i can get a glimpse of mt  fuji at the end of the day from the beach  but notpletely relying on it  not going to kawaguchiko just means we have toe back to japan again soon and do it  i will probably book a night at an onsen next time we go  i m so excited for this trip ,1

an osaka specialty coffee guide,  introfollowing up from  my last post  about specialty coffee in tokyo  and  u ageriatrichobo s  post about kyoto specialty coffee  i wanted to write this post about specialty coffee in osaka as with the other posts  this will focus on specialty coffee shops  which most major chains in japan don t fall under  so no doutors or excelsiors here format will be like my tokyo coffee post   i will provide some of the important information like address  website  english friendliness  and prices of some of theon items  as well basically mini reviews thoughts of the places i ve been to  specialty coffee  osaka vs  tokyoosaka  by merit of being much smaller than tokyo  has a smaller specialty coffee scene  with fewer shops  on the flip side  many of osaka s places will also be clustered in the most popular areas like namba  shinsaibashi  and umeda  current  want to go  listsame as in my other post  here s a list of other places in osaka i ll have to visit in the future  coutume coffee   kita ku  umeda   this is a branch of a paris specialty coffee roaster  lilo coffee kissa   shinsaibashi  mill pour coffee   minamisenba  mel coffee roasters   shinmachi  hoop coffee   minamisenba  mondial kaffee   kitahorie  nishi ku  granknot   kitahorie  nishi ku        lilo coffee roasters  location   lilo coffee roasters amerikamura 542 0086 osaka  chuo ward  nishishinsaibashi     website   lilo coffee roasters     english friendliness  menus and bean selections descriptions in english  every barista i interacted with had decent english     espresso milk drinks  400   550 yen    drip pourover coffee  350   1000 yen    photos   coffee selection pinboard   the cramped interior   your coffee is served with a tasting notes card founded in mid 2014 as an offshoot of a hair stylist  yes  really  lilo coffee roasters is a tiny coffee shop in shinsaibashi and one of the original specialty coffee shops in osaka  it s also one of my favorite coffee shops in japan for many reasons  they roast their own beans  which tend to be good fantastic  the brewed coffee is quite nice  and the staff are very friendly they do espresso drinks  but lilo s strength is in their hand drip coffee made with beans of your choosing  at any given time  they will probably about two dozen coffee beans to choose from  and have a board with cards describing each coffee s taste profile and origin  you can be easily overwhelmed here the coffee  though  tastes great  i ve had multiple pourovers here with beans from multiple origins  and the coffee has been balanced  sweet  nicely acidic  with really nice notes my big negative with lilo would have to do with how loud and crowded it gets  it s conveniently located in a popular area  and the shop is quite famous as it gets mentioned on  best of  lists  so you will very likely be at the shop with many tourists hauling luggage big backpacks and who take very long times to order and will sit around for long periods after drinking their coffee  the shop interior is quite small so it can get almost claustrophobic during even small rushes  definitely a place to drink your coffee and then leave they also have their own take on a kissaten called  lilo coffee kissa  located a 5 10 minute walk away  i have not been there but it s a popular destination  as well  the roasters coffee shinsaibashi   location   the roasters coffee shinsaibashi  542 0086  website   roasters shinsaibashi  english friendliness  limited english   very basic english on menus  staff speaks little to no english  drip pourover  350 400 yen  espresso milk drinks  420 500 yen  photos   seating area i stumbled upon this place as it s a couple minutes up the street from lilo coffee roasters  it can be easy to miss because their signage tends to use their japanese name   this place is two stories   the first floor  contains their coffee roasting operation and a small order window where you can buy roasted beans or order drinks  the second floor is seating for customers who aren t taking drinks to go coffee wise   their coffee beans are definitely roasted on the darker side  and it shows  my pourover  i forget the bean origin i ordered  was dark and heavy bodied  very much like a normal cup of coffee where you d probably consider adding sugar or milk to cut the bitterness  not my normal preferences for a cup of coffee  but i thought it was drinkable but the real call out here is the honey cappuccino  which my wife ordered  the sweetness of the honey cut the strength of the espresso and made this drink one of her favorite espresso milk drinks in the world  for reference  the latte from glitch coffee in tokyo is her favorite  this place also does really nice latte art  tasogare coffee stand  location   tasogare coffee stand minamisenba  542 0081  website   tasogare site  english friendliness  basic menus in english  i spoke to the staff members in japanese  don t think they spoke a large amount of english  espresso milk drinks  450   550 yen  if i remember  drip pourover coffee  500 800 yen  photos   shop interior less than a ten minute walk from lilo coffee roasters  tasogare coffee stand is another one of my favorites  i actually learned about them from the staff of a nearby clothing store who were curious about why i was vacationing in osaka tasogare is a very chill coffee shop   small and cozy  but unlike lilo coffee roasters  it s much more low key and not particularly well known to tourists  so it s also not super busy  the shop s interior  ambience  staff  and clientele are all very hip hop  i really enjoyed just sitting here drinking coffee and just listening to the japanese hip hop music being played over the speakers like with lilo  if you re going for pourover you might be overwhelmed by choice  when i last went there  the bean selection numbered at least 20  all of which are roasted on site in a small capacity coffee roaster  this is a great  place to get coffee from lesson origins   the menu had beans originating from india  yunnan  china  and papua new guinea  along with many selections from throughout africa  indonesia  and south america i had a pourover made from an indian monsoon malabar coffee   it was nicely made  a more robust tasting coffee than i normally drink  but it was chocolatey and earthy  my wife had their latte  which showed another strong point for the coffee shop  they pour fantastic andplex latte art  brooklyn roastingpany  location  multiple locations in osaka  namba  kitahama  kishiwada  also two locations in tokyo  website   brooklyn

cappuccino hailing from brooklyn  ny  brooklyn roastingpany has opened 5 locations across osaka tokyo  yet continue to have only one location in the us  i consider espresso and milk drinks their strength  and my wife and i enjoyed a couple milk drinks from them   she had a latte and i had a cappuccino  you can choose from one of two coffee beans for espresso drinks   one will normally be the iris blend  which is brooklyn s normal coffee for espresso  and the other will be a rotating choice i went to the kitahama location  and it is a nice space  with a design aesthetic i d describe as brooklyn industrial loft  there is an outdoor seating area  though  which overlooks the river and it s a great place to just sit and unwind  unir specialty coffee  location   hankyu umeda department store 10th floor  530 8350  there are also a couple locations in kyoto  website   unir umeda  english friendliness  menus in english  osaka branch staff has varying levels of english  drip coffee  300   350 yen  if i remember  espresso milk drinks  450 650 yen  photos   kiosk   the atrium   shakerato   cappuccino i ve mentioned unir a couple times in other posts talking about japanese coffee  it s a specialty coffeepany with shops in osaka and kyoto  and produced the 2018 japanese barista champion tomoko yamamoto  i have a bias toward this chain as i ve met both the ms yamamoto at the 2019 world barista championship  she makes a mean cortado  and i m on friendly terms with the staff at the hankyu umeda store  but anyway unir specialty coffee is  as mentioned  located on the 10th floor of the hankyu umeda department store  it s a kiosk that overlooks a large  two floor atrium  and sells beans  coffee merch wares  and drinks i d consider espresso based drinks their specialty  and i favor the cappuccino and shakerato here  the shakerato is especially amazing when it s a hot day  since it s served cold i would describe unir s coffee as good but  weird    their espresso was very bright and acidic  and it shines through in their drinks  this is something that specialty coffee lovers will probably be familiar with  but most coffee drinkers i know would find the taste quite odd    all day coffee  location   grand front osaka  website   grand front all day  english friendliness  basic menus in english  i don t think the staff spoke particularly much english  pourover coffee  550 yen  espresso milk drinks  500   600 yen   dripper setup   coffee all day coffee is an interesting coffee shop  it s actually a coffee kiosk with some seating in the basement of the grand front osaka office retail building  near the hilton osaka hotel  this place is pretty low key and most of the clientele are just office workers from the area they re a project by  transit general office  a japanese firm that focuses on building out new concepts and businesses  sometimes with partners  that makes all day coffee a sisterpany to places like little darling coffee roasters in tokyo  and mercedes me downstairs coffee  more on them later  the place also sells a lot of lifestyle goods   you can get all day coffee totes  shirts  clipboards   what   and more but on to the coffee   i went here multiple times over a couple trips  i find the coffee pretty good   they roast their own beans  but they also get beans from little darling coffee roasters  i got only pourovers and my wife got lattes  i found the pourovers leaning toward acidic  but balanced  not coffee that blew my socks off  but it would definitely be coffee i could drink all day they also serve food and donuts  which look delicious and you ll see them constantly cooking them in their open kitchen  but i have never eaten anything here  mercedes me   downstairs coffee   location   grand front osaka   knowledge capital  website   mercedes me   downstairs coffee  english friendliness  english menus  staff probably speaks english  coffees  550   600 yen  photos   the latte art is nice   the ordering bar   the logo i do not rend this place   coffee this expensive shouldn t be bad this place is a few floors up from all day coffee  and is the coffee shop tied to a mercedes benz dealership  the coffee was very dark  bordering on over roasted  it s very much an espresso milk drink place  and even in a drink like a latte  the coffee s bitterness couldn t be masked  if you re in this area and wanting coffee  go to all day or unir or any other place  takamura wine and coffee roasters  location   edobori  nishi ward  website   takamura coffee  english friendliness  decent english  aeropress pourover coffee  500   600 yen  espresso milk drinks  450   600 yen  photos   i like this sign on the outside   looking down from the second floor takamura wine and coffee roasters is kind of out there  it s a roughly 10 15 minute walk from either higobashi station or hommachi station  first off  the space is gorgeous and spacious  the first floor is the shop floor  but there s a second floor with tons of seating  the entire store is very bright with a lot of sunlight let in through their massive windows  the store is actually a very large shop that specializes in imported wines  and has a large coffee roasting operation on site  the coffee part of the shop sells a very wide variety of coffee beans   you get someon origins but also get some special selections like cup of excellence winners to choose from  they also sell some unique coffee gear like a black gold tsubame kalita wave dripper  which i ended up buying because it s quite beautiful  the shop s beans are very good  too  i bought a bag of their ethiopia alaka beans to take home with me  and they brewed up quite nicely and were a hit with my coworkers  this is probably not too surprising  as takamura also placed 2nd in the japan coffee roasting championships the specialty here would definitely be aeropress  one of the head baristas is the 2018 japan aeropress champion  the prices don t change regardless of bean selection  so i got an aeropress with a very nice colombia cup of excellence winning bean  the coffee was very smooth  had some good fruit notes  and was very drinkable if you find yourself out here and get confused about the coffee choices  the staff are quite friendly and helpful  and will talk to you about the various types of coffee they re currently roasting  they rended me the coffee i eventually bought and brought back to the us  hoshino coffee  location  throughout japan  i ve been to ones in osaka  kagoshima  tokyo  etc  website    hoshino is a very widespread chain throughout japan  and i ve been to multiple ones throughout the country  i put it here because they re basically a kissaten that serves nicer coffee than places like doutor hoshino serves a variety of foods in addition to coffee  like curry and pasta  but the real draws are the fluffy pancakes and souffl s  i would rend either of them if you re in a hoshino for a snack or dessert  when you order a pancake or souffl  your waiter will likely ask a long question in japanese  which is basically asking you  is it okay that your order will take 20 minutes to make  i say this just in case you are like my wife who doesn t expect waitstaff to ask her something really long after she points to a picture of pancakes on the menu the coffee itself is fine  i normally get their hoshino blend coffee  and it s made via pourover  it s drinkable and very traditional in taste  and pairs well with the sweet pancakes you should have ordered ,1

best way to get around izu peninsula ,i m going to be staying for a night in izukogen between my time in tokyo and osaka  i think getting to izukogen is pretty straightforward  but i was thinking about travelling around izu the next day  since i don t need to be in osaka until the evening  what are people s thoughts on the best way to get around izu options i m aware of rail  seems to just cover the east coast  between atami and shimoda izu dreampass  prettyprehensive  rail  bus  and ferry are all included  and not a bad price what it is  but it s for 2 3 days  the ones that cover izukogen are both 3 days  so some of the price would be wasted  and it seems to be based off of a fixed number of routes which all end in shimizu  which is kind of an awkward end point since i don t think any shinkansen stop there for the rest of my ride to osaka  so i d have to take a local train and change at the next major station pay for tokai buses as you go  very flexible  covers pretty much the whole peninsula  sounds like it s fairly fast and efficient  though not as fast as rail  could get expensive with many trips  also i hear they don t take ic cards  which makes it more annoying ito kanko free pass  tokai buss ito free pass  unlimited and cheap  but only covers ito  izukogen  and jogasaki coast areas renting a car is probably the right answer  but driving on the left is too weird for me  pif i was going to be in the peninsula for 2 or more days  i d think about the dreampass  but just for one day  i might just do the ito free pass and spend time in ito izukogen before going back up to atami and getting the shinkansen for osaka does this sound reasonable  anything i missed  anyone who s been there think there s enough stuff to do in the ito area for most of a day  or should i try to get to other parts of the izu peninsula edit  for reference  this will be in mid march,1

itinerary check   tokyo  gt  kumano kodo  gt  kyoto   2 weeks at end of may,my wife and i  both 28  are super excited to take our first trip to japan   the dates are a ways out  late may into june  but i figured i may as well post an itinerary check to get some early feedback day 1   tokyo arrival we will be staying  here  for 4 nights in tokyo   it is a little ways from shinjuku station  but the rooftop onsen and good price seemed like a decent trade off while still having a decent location   first night will be walking around and finding dinner  then getting some good sleep day 2   shinjuku and shibuya no detailed plans yet  but we want to check out the shinjuku area  piss alley and memory lane  and maybe walk across shinjuku gyoen national garden to shibuya   we like to walk to experience most cities we have visited in the past  but we will also get a 3 day metro pass for tokyo   we definitely want to shop at the nintendo store and loft in shibuya  and eat and shop wherever looks interesting day 3   asakusa  sumo tournament  and akihabara my plans for this day may be a little over zealous  but we will definitely be going to the sumo tournament this afternoon just east of akihabara   my idea at this point is to go to asakusa in the morning before it gets too crowded  then head to the sumo tournament around 1 2pm  and then maybe head over to akihabara afterwards around 7pm   if we get too tired after the tournament  we may just head back to the hotel onsen and then have another night out in shinjuku day 4   open tokyo day this day  saturday  is mostly unplanned   we may head over to akihabara if we didn t see enough of it on the prior day  or may want to spend more time in shibuya  or may want to check out teamlab planets  though it is an hour by transit from our hotel   the sky tree is not high on my list at this point  but we may have a change of heart when there   tsukiji fish market is another option we are considering  though i haven t looked into the details of the location change yet day 5 10 kumano kodo nakahechi route hiking the kumano kodo is definitely my most anticipated experience   we will have a full 4 days of hiking  plus a halfday of travel on either end   we will leave tokyo early sunday morning  catching the nozomi to osaka  and then a smaller train and bus to the trail head   i will probably ship most of our luggage from tokyo straight to our hotel in kyoto  so we will only have our backpacks for the hike   we will be following  this itinerary  fairly closely  though on the last day  we will stay the night in katsuura   we both love getting out of the big cities and experiencing rural culture and life when visiting a new place  so this part of our trip should be a fantastic highlight   after the hike  we will end up in kyoto for 3 full days day 11   kyoto east side we will have 3 full days in kyoto  sat mon  and then fly back out of tokyo on tuesday   we are staying at  kyoto inn gion the second  which seems to be a really good location   first day we will probably just check out eastern kyoto  kiyomizu dera  philosopher s path  and maybe fushimi inari taisha and or the silver pavilion   i doubt we will get to everything  but i want to experience this area of kyoto and just have the full day to walk around and see whatever we see day 12   kyoto west side i am planning on a full day for the west side of kyoto  including the bamboo grove  monkey park  and several other shrines in western kyoto   we may check out the golden pavilion and or ryoan ji if we have the time   we may flip this day with day 11  as western kyoto sounds a little less crowded  and we will probably be pretty tired after the kumano kodo hike and would likely appreciate a slower paced day day 13   open kyoto day  maybe nara day trip at this time  i am leaning towards having another day in kyoto to see more temples  nijo castle  and go back to anything we missed or want to see again in eastern kyoto   but  if we feel like we have seen enough of kyoto  we may decide to do a half day or full day trip to nara   the temple there looks impressive  and the deer would be cool  though i have been around wild elk walking around yellowstone and areas of colorado  so that in itself isn t a huge selling point   day 14 is simply riding the shinkansen back to tokyo for our evening flight home tldr 3 days in tokyo    1 day shinjuku shibuya  1 day asakusa  sumo  and akihabara  1 open day 6 days on kumano kodo3 days in kyoto    1 day eastern kyoto  1 day western kyoto  1 open day  possible nara day trip any feedback is appreciated   and if you read this whole long winded post  thank you   i know i tend to over plan on vacations  but i am usually quite flexible with unexpected changes when we are actually there ,1

japan parks  time ,simple question  this is regarding to normal parks not theme parks im going to tokyo and will be visiting some parks  from the japan guide it says that theres usually a time thing like for rikugien gardens its 9am to 5pm with last admission at 4 30pm does this mean at 5pm all guests must be out of the garden  or does it just means by 5pm no one else can enter but those in the park can stay until they feel their walk sightseeing is enough and they can leave as is thank you ,1

following osaka  hiroshima for a night  or fly straight to sapporo ,hi all planning a second trip to japan in late april may  our trip so far takes us from tokyo to kawaguchiko  then to kyoto and osaka  following osaka  though  we re a bit torn whether to train down to hiroshima for the peace museum and mazda car museum  any other recs  before flying up to sapporo  or to skip hiroshima entirely and fly direct from osaka to sapporo  we d likely stay in miyajima if we did include hiroshima in the trip for reference  we re planning on returning to tokyo for another 4 5 nights following sapporo hokkaido  it ll unfortunately be during golden week  which we just realized this week  d oh thoughts ,1
itinerary draft 2  tokyo and kyoto with day trips ,hello guys me and my girlfriend  early 30 s  will visit japan from november 17th to the 30th  17 nov  land at narita airport at 10 30  we will probably stay in a airbnb in nakano  take a walk in  nakano  and nearby  koenji  if we are not terribly tired maybe go and check  shinjuku  18 nov  walk through  asakusa   ueno  and  akihabara  if we are not tired go for some beers in a yokocho in the city center  19 nov  visit  teamlab  and take a walk in  odaiba  check  harajuku  and  shibuya  if we are not tired  go and explore  shimokitazawa  by night  20 nov   nikko  daytrip  in the evening check whatever we missed the previous days  or explore more thoroughly a neighbourhood we visited and liked  or explore a new neighbourhood if we didn t like any of those we already visited  21 nov   ghibli  museum in the morning  the rest of the day as yesterday after nikko  do whatever we like this is the tokyo part of the trip  22 nov  onsen day  probably  gero  or somewhere near  takayama  23 24 25 26 27 nov   kyoto  and a day trip to  nara  at the 26th  28 nov   koyasan  29 nov   osaka  30 nov  leave from kansai airport in the morning my questions are the following 1  the obvious first question  does it look nice to you  what would you change for practical  or whatever else  reasons 2  from googling  which obviously is not a god  it seems like shimokitazawa  and koenji would be our type of neighbourhood for an afternoon coffee and night life  if you can rend any similar neighbourhoods in tokyo and especially kyoto  so i start building a vague image for the city if you take out all the  hopefully wonderful  touristic things it has to offer  that would be a great help 3  does anyone know if i can send my luggage from tokyo at the 22nd and pick them up in kyoto at the 23rd in an airbnb or a train station  the same for sending out luggage from kyoto at the 28th and pick them from a hotel in osaka at the 29th 4  i am trying to find a ryokan in gero or takayama for these days  and there not a lot of choices in all the known aodation booking sites  is this just bad luck  or the ryokans don t give rooms for booking until closer in the date that you want to book for  i e  should i wait or hurry up and book whatever is left thanks a lot in advance ,1
need help building itinerary  1 week ,hey  been lurking for a while on here and finally pulled the trigger to visit tokyo with a friend a while ago  we ll fly in around one and a half weeks and will stay for a week  so 6 nights in an airbnb  our room is in shinjuku first of all i want to say we don t want help planning a whole itinerary  just some guidance on how much time we should plan approximately for what and maybe just some extra information on anything really from the people here would be cool so  concerning our itinerary  we already have ideas on what we want to see  now we re trying to plan around this and to see how much time we should leave for what exactly  we don t really want to make it too stressful and plan every hour of the day perfectly  but just an idea of what we should do when is enough for us  it s a vacation after all and that shouldn t be stressful we ve already bought the tickets for the teamlab borderless museum and suspect we will stay 3 4 hours there  one thing we also want to buy in advance is a ticket for the tokyo skytree but we don t know how much time we should plan for that and if there s anything around there we shouldbine it with  same with teamlabs borderless what we definitely want to see do is  teamlabs borderless museum  tokyo skytree  shopping in akihabara  what are the coolest things we should check out there  visiting a temple  senso ji seems to be the most famous one  go to shibuya and check out the don quijote mall  how long  what s in the area  go thrifting for fashion  we suspect that we are going to set aside a whole day for this as we are both really into fashion  where s the best area for extensive thrifting with a lot of cool stores  koenji  shimokitizawa what we possibly want to do if there s the time and convenience  visiting an animal caf  visit a park  visit miraikan museum  go to hama rikyu  go to odaiba  check out the rainbow bridge  at night  visit mount fujii hope someone can give us just a little bit of guidance and maybe answer some of the questions above  it would be really helpful  again  we don t want help building a whole specific itinerary  just some general tips  thank you ,1

itinerary check   mar 26   apr 9   tokyo  kyoto  osaka,hello everyone  i and a group of close friends  10 total  are traveling to japan for our first time this late march to early april of this year  i realize it s a huge group  so i would appreciate any advice if you ve had a large group before or tips for planning organization  we ve been planning this trip for more or less 2 years  and recently got together this past weekend toe up with a detailed itinerary  we re very excited about the plans we ve made and would like to share it with the subreddit to get some feedback and additional ideas or advice   3 26  depart from us our flight leaves at 7am so we re looking forward to a long and  fun  journey  it ll be many people s first time flying internationally so i hope they re prepared  i ve never flown ana before but i heard it s one of the best flight experiences you can get  looking forward to trying the food  i think airline food is underrated  unpopular opinion 3 27  arrive at narita we ll be arriving at narita at 4pm  first things are to pick up jr passes  ic cards  sim cards  and portable wifi routers  we ll inevitably get caught in the afternoon rush hour so it ll be a fun introduction to city  our airbnb for our stay in tokyo is located in east toshima ku  and depending on how late it is or how much energy we have  i d like to at least walk around the neighborhood and find some food  rendations would be appreciated for things to do in the area 3 28  chiyoda tokyo station  imperial palace  akihabara  uniqlo ginza  we re big fans of uniqlo  and ueno zoo if we have time   3 29  odaiba aquacity  decks  divercity  rainbow bridge  museum of maritime science  teamlab borderless and planets  i ve seen rendations to go to teamlab in the evening as they are less crowded and wait time is shorter   3 30  shibuya mainly just walking around and visiting all the high rises and districts for shopping and dining  center gai  shibuya station  shibuya crossing  scramble square  would love rendations for specific shops or restaurants 3 31  asakusa tokyo skytree  senso ji  nakamise  sumida park  i ve read that the park is great for cherry blossoms  which hopefully lines up with the forecast so far   4 1  shinjuku kabukicho  golden gai  shinjuku gyoen  shin okubo  omoide yokocho  samurai museum  robot restaurant  this seems like a lot so we may divide and do some of these on 3 30 4 2  day trip to nikko our schedule only allowed for one day trip out of tokyo so it was between hakone and nikko  we decided on the latter after a unanimous group vote because we wanted to explore all the scenic locations that nikko had to offer  we were blown away by photos of the waterfalls and landscape  we also wouldn t have enough time to see everything we wanted in hakone so we ll leave that to our next trip to japan 4 3  travel to kyoto we ll be checking out from tokyo in the am and traveling to kyoto by shinkansen  where we ll drop off our bags at our lodging before having a half day to explore the city  some locations we ll be going to in our time in kyoto are ginkaku ji  kinkaku ji  arashiyama  fushimi inari  and kiyomizu dera  along with other temples  shrines  and general sightseeing and shopping   4 4  kyoto  trip to uji and nara we ll be spending some more time in kyoto with a trip to uji and nara at some time during the day for byodoin  uji s tea  and nara park 4 5  osaka we ll be spending two days in osaka  give or take  we ll be going to osaka castle  dotonburi  cup noodles museum  osaka aquarium  and possibly a trip down to koyasan if we have the time 4 6  osaka a continuation of the previous day  we have no specific schedule other than to wander around and explore the city if we re not going to one of the planned destinations 4 7  day trip to hiroshima we were on the fence about if we wanted to travel so far  so this is still being decided  one one hand  we would love to see the history of hiroshima and go to the peace memorial park and museum  as well as the atomic bomb dome  however  the travel time and tons of other stuff to do would definitely rush us and skip a lot  the alternative is to take a day trip to kobe himeji instead  which would be a lot closer and more feasible 4 8  kyoto  return to tokyo we ll have the morning to visit destinations we missed or do some shopping dining before we leave for tokyo in the afternoon   4 9  return home the dreaded day  our flight leaves at 4pm so we might have time to do some last minute shopping before we go to narita  thanks for giving our itinerary a read  we ll definitely be going back some time in the future so not a huge deal if we miss some things  but we wouldn t want to miss the best  we would love any kind of feedback or suggestions to make our trip as memorable as possible  also  we  love  food  so tell me about your favorite restaurants or hidden gems  as well as new things to try ,1

after 16 years or dreaming  i finally decided to go to japan ,hey there everyone  ever since i was little and my older brother told me that a country named japan existed that looks almost the same as the cartoons i was watching at the time  yes you guessed it  it was anime  d   i wanted to visit this country  fast forward 16 years  and i m planning my very first trip to japan  i m thinking between 2 dates and i d probably can go there for a week since i can only manage that much money right now  yes  sadly money is also an issue that is the reason it s only for a week  and  why i seek adivce  altough the prices i saw and the prices you know might be diferent i m either thinking on a week in may or september for now  since i can t count on my friends i have to pick a place and date that s managable even alone  i ve only been to a couple other european countries with my family soo traveling alone such a long distance will be a first for me and honestly a bit frightening i m honestly interested in the more rural areas of japan  the  japanese japan  places   i d rather see those than your avarage tourist attractions  i d only visit kabukicho for now because that place is iconic for me because of the yakuza games  and maybe akihabara  but i might just go to these places on a second trip after getting enough courage and experience and money  i m seeking adivce regarding traveling trips  aodations  how reliable is airbnb  i ve also seen this host family website that looked quite nice  i just don t know if they would let me stay for only a week or what things i need  maybe presents when i go to a host family etc   basic things i should know or be careful about that s not up on the internet  how are japanese people with soldiers  people who work at the miltary  i d also would like to document every moment because i m not sure when i will get another chance like this  i m thinking of getting a gopro hero 7 because of the 4k quality  is it a good choice for filming and taking pictures thank you in advance for any help you can provide   edit  since enough people made fun of me because of my  japanese japan ent while i was away  here s some clarification  what i meant by it are the more traditional looking  authentic places areas  english isn t my first language so you ll have to excuse me if i m not a 100  perfect with it ,1

good amount of time in takayama ,hi everyone my partner and i are planning our first trip to japan and are trying to sketch out an itinerary  we re arriving mid to late march and plan to spend a few days in tokyo  then head to takayama by train  we re looking to get out of the big cities and have some nice relaxing time and it looks like a good place to do that  but we re also wondering if an entire weekend there  2 nights and 2 3 days depending on how trains line up  would be too long  it looks like there are some excellent side trip options to onsen and shirakawa go  which we re also exploring  is there something else around the region we may be missing  we re also looking to stay in a ryokan in this area  so any personal rendations for one would be fantastic ,1

itinerary   tokyo   osaka   kyoto,so my girlfriend and i will be travelling to japan from canada  for the first time  leaving aug 11  arriving 12th at narita airport in the evening   we ll be in japan from aug 12th to aug 23rd morning   our itinerary is structured solely by location and what we were interested in various areas of the city   definitely interested in seeing what everyone thinks of this schedule so far and whether or not it s too tight for us or even whether or not there are other things you guys think we should visit tokyo aug 12   day 1    landing at narita airport in the evening  so will just travel straight to our hotel in shinjuku to check in and rest day 2 amp 3  spend these two days at disneyland and disneysea  gt  though we might drop disneyland from this to clear another day depending on how we feel day 4    check our meiji shrine in the morning  head over to the ghibili museum  head back to shinjuku to check out the area  check out omoide yokocho for some street food  check out club sega or a similar arcade  potentially check out sunshine city on this same day day 5  check out the diver city shopping mall area  head to teamlab borderless  shop around at shibuya 109  explore attractions around the shibuya and ginza area day 6  spend some time in the akihabara area   visit ueno park  tokyo national museum  sensoji temple  shopping around in taito city train to osaka really not sure how to ideally break down the 3 days we have in osaka  but will likely dedicate one full day to universal studios  visiting nara park on the way into out of osaka  just unsure if lugging our luggage around would be feasible here  another day for exploring the dotonbori area  visiting the osaka aquarium kaiyukan and osaka castle day trip to kyoto  would like to visit various shrines and temples such as fushimi inari  kinkakui  visit arashiayama trip back to tokyo  will have one free day here to rest visit things we missed in tokyo and to be closer to the airport for when we leave the following day in the morning is it worth it for us to buy the jr rail pass for this trip ,1
1 night stop along a shinkansen route,hi all i m in the early stages of planning a trip for 4 people  2 couples  in november  the way that our travel is working out along side our jr passes basically means we will be going from osaka to tazawako station  in akita  for a night in an onsen up there  fingers crossed for autumn foliage to break up the  6 hour train trip we are planning on having a one night stop along the route there  preferably along the second shinkansen of the trip so we can easily check in to our onsen early the next morning  the station stops along the akita line are as follows  omiya  sendai  morioka  shizukuishibut we could also stop at shinagawa which is just before the tokyo change over we d only have the afternoon evening and night there  we aren t big partiers or anything  just looking for somewhere that would make a nice stroll around and has some good dinner places  most of these places look like they already check those boxes  but i m just interested in some input from peoples experiences thanks ,1

itenerary check   tokyo during golden week,so  i got these cheap flights into tokyo  leaving april 28  arriving april 29  and leaving on may 5  at the time that i bought them  i didn t think about it being golden week  it was too late by the time i realized  that being said  i figured it would be best to stay in tokyo rather than hop onto a crowded train  i ll be with my mom for the trip who is pretty energetic  we are taking a trip to nikko  which i understand is a hot spot for japanese  but i didn t know where else to go with such cool temples  pretty rural  and not like a 5 hour train ride  i wasn t sure exactly how to arrange these days  since i didn t know how much jetlag i d have   8 hour difference  these days are structured pretty solely by location  but obviously i m open to suggestions  i have the time tables laid out  but really i don t know if i ll need more or less time  i do admittedly like anime  so i m hoping while i m in akihabara on the last day i can look at stuff and buy some souvenirs  i like both the traditional and modern culture of japan as well as shopping  so i went for a mix of both  i also love japanese food and will try almost anything so long as it s safe i have a few things i want to do that i haven t put into any days yet  i want to go to some sort of animal  cat pig snake  cafe for sure  and i would like to go to the ghibli museum  but i understand it isn t that likely  trying some tea either in a traditional ceremony or just at a tea shop would be nice  since i love tea  except green unfortunately  i think it would be cool to do a teamlabs thing if there s time  but i m not super concerned if it doesn t happen   april 29th  arrive at the airbnb at about 4 30pm in otsuka    5pm eat soba at a walking distance soba shop nearby  take it easy may 1  ginza  tsukiji fish market  sanrio world  emporer s east garden  dover street market   this day is pretty open since i m concerned about jetlag   may 2  nikko  6am  go to asakusa and then take the tobu line to nikko  buying the world area pass  9am  explore most of the temples  get lunch  go to kinugawa onsen to relax after hiking all day  head home around 5 or 6 may 3  shibuya   busiest day  8am deus ex machina for coffee  8 30 am kiddy land   i like stuffed animals  and it s nearby  9 30 am meiji jingu shrine  11 30 am  lunch at sakura tei  okonomiyaki  12 30 pm takeshita dori  2pm  hackiko plaza  2 30 pm  shibuya 109 shopping  i enjoy lolita fashion so i figure i ll spend some time here  free time may 4  shinjuku  8 30 am breakfast somewhere  hoping to try some of those fluffy pancakes  9 30 am gyoen garden  11 30 am tokyo met government bldg  12 pm lunch at shin udon  1 pm golden gai  3 pm thermae yu onsen  to relax after so much walking  free time may 5  akihabara  last day  9 30 am don quijote to buy souvenirs  general walking around  advice wanted  12 pm get back to airbnb  pack up  either eat in akihabara or here  1pm leave for narita airport  2 pm arrive at nrt airport flight leaves at 4 50pm ,1

march trip to tokyo  staying in akiba ,i ll be visiting tokyo for 12 nights in late march for  hopefully  the height of cherry blossom season   this will be my first trip to japan i m hoping someone who has done this already might be able to help alleviate my biggest concern  which is getting to the hotel from the airport initially   my hotel is literally connected to akihabara station   i ll being in via delta air  and i m sure i ll already be pretty exhausted from the trip   i ve already unlocked my cell phone and am ordering a japanese sim through amazon so i hopefully will have data to ease things but beyond that  would anyone be able to detail a cheap ish  and efficient route to get from narita to akihabara station   additionally  i ve slowly been adding things to my itinerary that i want to do  i love urban exploration  and am planning for a lot of this  but am always happy to learn of more  cant miss  items edit to clarify which airport i m flying into ,1

highly doubt i m going to spend every meal sitting down at a restaurant for deep introspection lol  should i take some extra steps and plan where i m going to eat everyday  there s no specific foods or places i want to go  i was going to just stop into whatever hole in the wall or chain i stumble across  i m also not a picky eater  so any restaurant suggestions are always wee 2  are there any other popular fish markets in tokyo  i know tsukiji closed down 3  realistically  how much would i be spending on transportation with my current itinerary  my plan is to get a suica card and load it whenever i deplete the card 4  are cat cafes worth it  i heard the cats get so many pets all day  they only really seem to be interested in you when you have treats and such  5  do i need to spend a full day to recuperate after the long day of traveling  i don t mind maybe splitting my day in shibuya into two since it s a bit crammed  but i guess i wont really know until i m there 6  some camera

trying to plan six days between  kyoto  nara  koyasan  is this too much to do  should we skip koyasan or nara ,my boyfriend  27m  and i  23f  are two canadians off to japan this spring for the first time  our trip is from  april 6th to 23rd  18 days  and we have mostly planned out what we are doing but are worried we are doing too much in the middle and are not leaving enough time to thoroughly enjoy each place  kyoto nara koyasan   amp x200b our timeline is as follows we leave miyajima late  saturday april 11th for kyoto  and have to be in  tokyo saturday april 18th  early for a car rental  renting a r34 gtr  this gives us  six  days to play with amp x200b three of many options saturday   sunday   monday   tuesday   wednesday   thursday   friday   saturday sleep kyoto kyoto kyoto kyoto koyasan koyasan nara tokyo sleep kyoto kyoto kyoto kyoto kyoto kyoto nara tokyo sleep kyoto kyoto kyoto kyoto koyasan koyasan koyasan tokyo amp x200b kyoto from the beginning kyoto for me has sounded really exciting  osaka and tokyo seem a little too busy for my liking and kyoto has much more history  the many shrines at first seemed wonderful now seem like a scheduling nightmare to see even 1 3rd of them  many appear to be at least an hour apart  we were thinking of doing three days in kyoto  we thought three days would be sufficient but it seems like there is an overwhelming amount to do in kyoto    the philosophers path  murayama park  shinto shrine   todo  uji  kyoto  japan  togetsukyo bridge   arashiyama district  bamboo forest  and monkey park  nakanoshima park this doesn t seem to give mush time for breathing but maybe it isn t as overwhelming as it seems to me   amp x200b nara i have heard many great things from my cousins about nara  they stated that you need 24hrs here at least to appreciate all it has to offer  mostly we want to go to the nara park and isuien gardens and see the todaiji and kasuga temples but visiting horyuji may also be interesting    amp x200b koyasan this to me sounds peaceful and educational  getting away from the cities for a night or two seems like it could be a different view of japan  i think it would be a great experience and learn more about buddhism and participate in morning prayer  visiting the many temples and the cemetery seems doable in a short period of time as the city is not very large  the travel there however is awkward and over three hours each way  it is also not included in our jdr train pass amp x200b question basically all three cities are lovely but we dont want to miss out on enjoying them by cramming to much into our schedule  so you think visiting the three cities is worth it or would you rend removing onepletely  if so which would you rend keeping amp x200b thank you in advance  i hope i laid this out in a way that makes sense and i didn t break any rules   i m new sorry ,1

october trip ideas ,hello  my boyfriend and i  one other couple  and one other friend are going to japan in mid october  it is my first time being off of the us east coast and my first time being in an airplane or out of the country in general so i m not really sure what to expect  i am  however  the main planner for the trip the thing is  though  because of my work i can only be absent for less than 14 days  i was thinking about making the trip around 10 days with a few days after we get back home to use as recovery and rest i would definitely love to see tokyo and kyoto perhaps tokyo for 5 or 6 days and spend the rest in kyoto with day trips to osaka  amp  nara  do you guys think this is a viable plan  or should we just focus on tokyo this time around  we are definitely going to do things like teamlab  toyota museums  joypolis  and the ghibli museum  as well as some castles and temples shrines in kyoto  i really want to make an effort to go to fushimi inari in the morning one day  make a day trip to nara  and go to super nintendo world at usj   if we can we are all tattooed and pierced and my boyfriend and other friend have hand tattoos as well speaking of which  do you guys have any onsen rendations for heavily tattooed people  or should we just not worry about it  i m kind of freaking out and definitely overwhelmed as we have no set itinerary but are all  go with the flow  people  so i don t want to plan too much and have time to explore  i read this sub all the time but if you guys think of anything that could be beneficial or something for me to think about  please let me know  thank youedit  i forgot to say that i really want to do  under the radar  things as well  we only have a bunch of touristy things planned  so any festivals or unique experiences would be amazing to me  we will all probably travel in a group most of the time  but will have days where we split up as well edit edit  my little brother is a massive godzilla fan  are their any rendations where i could find him some exclusive merch  i know there is a godzilla store  but i wasn t sure about any better options ,1

two potential kyushu itineraries   feedback ,hi all in summer 2021 i hope to take my first trip to japan with my wife  the plan is to start in tokyo and spend three nights  before flying to either  a  yakushima island  via kagoshima  for 5 nights  or b  oita to explore two onsen towns  yufuin 2 nights and kurokawa 3 nights    takachiho and mt  aso  in either case  i fully expect to rent a car and understand the requirements of obtaining an international license  my question is  in addition with a standard tokyo and kyoto itinerary  which of the two options above  a or b  would you choose  with 5 nights dedicated to each destination  we definitely are taking a  less is more  approach to travel  maybe that isn t the case for tokyo  however  so i m definitely okay if we spend ample time between two three places  a big reason for these two options is the emphasis on nature  i m really gobsmacked by the beauty of yakushima and would be in love with exploring the rain forests  at the same time  the diversity of the aso kurokawa region really appeals to me  and i m not sure if i d be able to get the same level of onsen on yakushima it s a tough choice for me  so i wee any feedback  by the way  i would utilize a 7 day jr pass after the a or b options  to continue on to kyoto  then back to tokyo for a roughly 17 18 day total trip ,1

hokkaido   northern honshu  tohoku    16 days   july 2020,hi again  so  after some reading here on reddit and on the internet  i made a first sketch of an itinerary for our hokkaido   tohoku trip in july  i am a bit overwhelmed by the too little but at the same time somehow too much amount of information about travelling around in tohoku  there s not much info but everything i ve read about i have added to the itinerary and well  it is not doable at all  a first idea is 04 july   sapporoarrival at sapporo at 16h  check in  walk  dinner and sleep 05 july   sapporowhole day to visit the city 06 july   sapporootaru day trip 07 july   sapporo to noboribetsutaking the train early in the morning to spend the whole day in noboribetsu 08 july   noboribetsu to hakodatearriving in the morning  rest of the day to visit the city 09 july   hakodate to aomori10 july   aomori to akitai ve been rended to take the resort shirakami train  experiences  i guess spending the day on the train and stopping at a couple of smaller places along the way 11 july   akita12 july   akita to sendaitaking the train early in the morning and using the day to visit the city 13 july   sendaigeibikei gorge trip in the morning  afternoon to continue visiting sendai itself 14 july   sendai to tokyohere i am doubting whether to spend the morning in sendai and heading towards tokyo in the afternoon evening or taking the day for tokyo too i also read that the local train from sendai to yamagata is nice  with nice stops along the way  so another option could be in the morning sendai to yamagata  stopping a couple of times  and then in the evening taking the shinkansen to tokyo 15 18 july   tokyo 19 july   flight back so  my main questions here are  i have my doubts regarding noboribetsu as i ve read mixed opinions  is it worth the time or shall we head somewhere different  and what about hakodate  is it enjoyable or better spend the day at some other place  in the previousents to this thread there were ideas about lake toya  furano  asahikawa  during our previous trip  tokyo was our last stop and we had very bad luck with the weather plus we were destroyed from all the walking the previous 2 weeks and we did not see nor enjoyed it a lot  this time i want to make sure i reserve reasonable enough time to discover it  is 4 days ok  or shall i cut time from sendai and give it to tokyo  experiences with the shirakami train  which stops along the way would you rend  there are several options for day trips from sendai  which are your favourites  options i ve read of are geibikei gorge  matsushima  goishi coastline  doable without a car  yamadera  hiraizumo  zao onsen any tips  rendations and ideas are more than wee many thanks everyone ,1
itinerary  7th   14th june,hey all   my wife and i have managed to organise a stop over in japan on the way home from our wedding  but we only have a week or so  which we understand is a relatively short time  but unfortunately it s all we have  we vee up with a rough list for our time there but really need some feedback to try and maximise our time there  7 6   arrive tokyo   6 35am   drop our bags at a hotel and visit the emperor s palace during the day  possibly check out the nightlife in ginza depending on how we feel     8 6   disneysea  9 6   day tour of mt fuji   we really don t like the idea of doing a guided touristy tour as it s not our thing  is it just as easy to go there and see it ourselves or is the tour worth the money 10 6   our aim is to travel to kyoto to see the rice planting fest at the fushimi inari taisha shrine   see details below 11 12  6   kyoto   nothing concrete planned for these two days but the arashiyama bamboo forest looks great  also want to see gion district 13 14  6   back to tokyo  also looking for suggestions for these 2 days  we were thinking to visit the fish market  a flea market and the shibuya crossing  departing at 10pm on the 14th so our biggest question really aside from how to fill those few days in tokyo and kyoto is how is the most efficient way to travel around  we know the weekly railpass is available for approx aud500 which would allow us to take the bullet train from tokyo to osaka  but considering we can get return flights for about aud150 each  the rail pass seems expensive  is there another option we haven t considered aside from the above  we also want to eat some amazing ramen  find a square watermelon  just because  and buy some weird stuff from a vending machine  are there any other other quintessential japanese experiences we should be looking to incorporate into our trip   thanks in advance,1

went into umeda station to eat and got charged by station staff on the way out  why ,partner and i went and tapped through the ticket gates with our ic card to eat at a restaurant located on the inside of hankyu umeda station  after our meal  we tried to tap our ic card again to exit the station and the gates didn t open up  we ve experienced this before when we went into a station by accident and tried to tap ourselves back out  so we did what we did last time and went to the station staff by the ticket gates to clear the error on our ic card  in our past experience  the station staff takes our ic card  clears the error and lets us exit the station with out any issues  however  this time  the station staff asked if we went into the station to eat and i said yes  he then typed up 320 on a calculator and asked us to pay  160 yen per person  before clearing our ic cards and letting us out  of course we paid as i wasn t really bothered to discuss the situation behind a language barrier  now we are just curious as to why we were charged the 160 yen per person  is this a new thing  why weren t we charged previously when we went into a station and back out  we would ve been a bit lost and trying to find our way the previous times if that helps  just looking to understand what happened here  thanks ,1

is ogibashi a nice place to stay at   see and explore   whilst being somewhat close to tokyo centre ,my boyfriends family  amp  i are considering visiting japan and are looking at aodation  i found a nice airbnb in ogibashi that can fit all 7 of us for 10 days costing ¥123 351  which also is much cheaper than actual hotels in japan  this gives us alot more money to spend while travelling   especially since its such a large family  does anyone here know much about the area  and is the travel to and fro to the centre of tokyo easy  i personally feel like it is a good option but would like more information   advice  we wont be going anywhere else in japan apart from the tokyo districts  we will be going in late november   24nov 2dec  if theres anything interesting things that aren t as well known   good for larger families to do that would also be very helpful tldr   is ogibashi a good location for tourists and for easy travel to and fro from the centre of tokyo   and is ¥123 351 aodating 7 people for 10 days a decent price edit   the 7 people are  mum and dad  two 18 year olds  two 15 year olds and one 10 year old  ,1

narita to tokyo car hire,looking for advice as if this is a feasible idea i m travelling to tokyo in april   a family of 6 including a wheelchair   our flight arrives early morning and our aodation in shinjuku is not available until late afternoon rather than catching the train or using taxis i m considering hiring a large people mover van for the day  so we can make our way to tokyo in a leisurely way  perhaps checking out narita town or other sites on the northeastern outskirts of tokyo  and then being able to drop my family and luggage directly at the aodation without having to navigate train stations etc  after that hopefully dropping the car off at a central car rental location in the city it seems to me this would not only be more convenient but probably cheaper for our family of six  than using the skyline express etc what do you think ,1

osaka kyoto tokyo 17 30 december 2019 trip report,hey all  i posted a while back with questions about my  itinerary  for my trip and i ve finally gotten around to writing a trip report about my experiences tips  hope it s of help to someone out there  this was my first overseas trip that wasn t part of a tour or with my parents  so i did almost all the planning myself  and by god it was daunting  i travelled with one other person and the trip was 2 weeks total  happy to answer any questions that arise   arriving in osaka    the first few hours were a bit overwhelming so i would rend  especially if it is your first time to japan  to give yourself more time than you think you need for arriving and sorting yourself out at the airport  our plane arrived at 5 30pm but after going through all the important things and then trying to sort ourselves out  we didn t leave until about 7 45pm   trains jr passes suica ic cards buses  the train system will seem daunting at first but you will soon get used to it   just follow what google maps says and you will never get lost  google maps will generally tell you what platform to be on  otherwise see which line the train you are catching is on and follow the signs for that specific line   use the colours to help you  being from sydney  i have an in built fear of missing a train and having to wait ages for the next one but don t worry if you miss a train in japan   there will be another one in no time at all    if you have pre bought a ticket for a bullet train  we were travelling from kyoto to tokyo  you can claim your ticket at the same place you pick up your jr passes at osaka airport    pro tip  don t be an idiot and insert your suica card into the paper slot  i did this at the airport station and died an embarrassing death  i was tired  okay     should you get a jr pass  if you need at least one return trip on a shinkanesen  e g  tokyo to kyoto return  then i would say yes  otherwise  i would say no   just get a suica or ic card for ease of use and flexibility    i travelled with one large suitcase and a small backpack for most of my trip  i found that most of the time travelling with a large suitcase wasn t too much of a problem  there was generally enough space on the trains  we even travelled a few times with our luggage during peak hour  and as long as you are courteous to other people s space then you will have no problems    one of the problems i did find was that it was often hard to find a lift  as they are usually tucked into small corners that may be missed  also  not all exits will have a lift  so if you are following google maps then be ready to carry your luggage up some stairs or walk back to find an exit with a lift    i was initially quite hesitant to take the bus but do not be afraid  the majority of buses within the major cities have english signs announcements and will let you know what stop ising up next  the hardest part is finding the right bus stop as there can be many in the same vicinity that go to very different places   universal studios    we stayed at the singulari hotel for two nights and i cannot rend it more  it was really close to universal studios and it has an onsen on one of the top levels which you are free to use as a guest    i paid for both a fast pass  4 rides  and a 15 minute early entry to usj  if i were to go again  i would probably forego the fast pass  as a lot of the more popular rides have single rider lines that are generally much shorter  however  take into account that it was a week day and that it had rained a little in the morning of the day i went  if you would really like to take some nice photos of hogwart s castle and diagon alley without any people in them  then i rend getting the early entry pass  we were able to get in about 30 minutes before the official opening time  you can get in earlier depending on when you pick up your pass but you will have a minimum of 15 minutes   nara day trip    if you plan on going to osaka then i highly rend doing a day trip to nara  it is really easy to get to and visit  with lots of signage and a tourist information centre right at the station  the walk from the station to nara park is very picturesque with lots of nice shops and the temples and shrines within surrounding the park are amazing    my friend booked us a lunch at wa yamamura  which is a small 3 michelin star restaurant in nara  the entire lunch took almost 3 hours and cost about  200 aud pp  iirc  the food was amazing and the entire experience and atmosphere was so different to anything i d ever experienced before  i would rend trying this place if you would like to try kaiseki style cuisine while you are in japan and can afford it    please  if you are to feed the deer at nara park  follow the rules that are plastered around the place  i saw many people withholding biscuits and eventually being chased by the deer  they can be aggressive when looking for food and you can definitely get hurt   also  the more you run  the more they will chase you  so please be logical    himeji castle  don t forget to visit kokoen garden when you visit himeji  especially if you like gardens    you can get a discountedbo ticket together with your entry to himeji castle  i went during winter and it was still nice  but i can imagine it would be stunning during spring and autumn    there is a lot to explore at himeji castle so if you are like me and like to take your time to take in everything and read every plaque  then i would set aside at least 3 hours to explore the castle itself osaka castle    this is a really nice place to visit if you really want to learn a bit of history  the museum inside is very informative and the view from the top of the castle is spectacular  i would set aside at least 2 hours if you plan on visiting osaka castle    if you aren t into the historic side  then i would suggest skipping the museum and just seeing the castle from the surrounding park  which is really nice to stroll around  you can get really nice pictures without having to pay a cent   kuromon market  while i love street food  i really don t enjoy being pushed around or not being able to move  this place is packed  especially during lunch time  lots of tour buses wille and go  so it can be really hard to eat and look around the main area of the market    if you are toe here  then i rend eating along the side streets  as the food is just as good and you won t get trampled by tourists    osaka city    osaka aquarium is worth a visit if you are into marine life  it s easy to spend a good 4 5 hours here  as its one of the largest aquariums in the world  i went there on a sunday and it was quite busy  so would rend going there on a weekday if you can  legoland is also close by if that is something you want to visit too   fushimi inari shrine  i initially planned to walk up the entirety of the mountain  however the walk was a lot steeper and taxing on my old knee injuries than i anticipated  instead  i turned back at the halfway point  there is also a small lookout at the halfway point which gave nice views  all in all  we spent 2 3 hours here exploring the shrine and surrounding shops food stalls  plan for more time if you intend to climb the entire mountain    if you want to get an insta worthy shot  its worth climbing at least halfway to get shots without any other people in them  there are also a few kimono rental places nearby  however climbing to a nice quiet spot in zori  japanese sandals worn with kimono  can be difficult   uji  this area wasn t initially on my itinerary  but rather a last minute decision  after abandoning the climb at fushimi inari  we had almost the entire afternoon free so decided to visit uji  uji is famous for its high quality green tea  so if you are a fan of green tea and matcha then i highly rending here    the train ride from fushimi inari to uji is straightforward and takes approximately 40 minutes    byodoin temple is a must visit in uji  on the walk from the station  there are many shops that sell food and souvenirs  as well as their famous green teas  so take your time to explore on the way to the temple  to step into the temple itself and see the phoenix hall is an extra fee on top of the entry fee to the temple gardens and museum  if you are into old cultural buildings then i would pay the extra to see the hall  otherwise i would skip it    we walked from byodoin temple to uji shrine and ujigami shrine  crossing the uji river along the way  these are not essential to see and are not as impressive as byodoin temple  however ujigami shrine is believed to be one of the oldest shrines in japan  so may be something that would interest you    one of the most famous green tea stores is called itohkyuemon and has a few different branches around uji  if you cannote to uji  there is also a store in gion and another in kyoto station  there are some other stores in uji which have been around for hundreds of years which i have heard are very interesting to visit  one of the most popular is called mitsuboshien kambayashi sannyu honten    note that i visited uji on a monday and a lot of the more traditional stores away from the tourist areas were closed   yasaka shrine and kodaji temple    my biggest rendation for exploring this area is to start early  if you want to take your time with the shrine and temple  then i rend putting aside the entire day  i  unfortunately  did not get this luxury as i was roped into a kimono photoshoot for most of the morning  more on that in a sec  so only had about 4 5 hours of sunlight to explore  both the shrine and temple have extensive gardens around them that are very nice to explore  the walk up to kodaji temple is full of nice shops  targeted to tourists  and snacks that you can explore all day  if you want to get off the tourist track  walking along the back alleys is like walking back through time  just be careful to take note which streets are private streets that do not allow photography    kimono experience  wearing a kimono was a fun experience  i had a blast picking out my colours and getting dressed up  if it is winter and you are prone to the cold then i rend wearing your thermals underneath  if i were to do this experience again  i would rather have this experience connected with a tea ceremony  there are places around kyoto that do this  but this is just my preference  my friend hired a photographer for an hour to take photos for us  this is worth it if you are looking for some really nice shots  as they are better at finding a nice area without many tourists for your shoot   arashiyama    tenryu ji temple and the surrounding gardens are absolutely gorgeous and a must visit in arashiyama  i imagine the garden would be even prettier in spring or autumn  so definitely check it out if you are visiting this area in those seasons  i spent about 1 5 hours here but would rend at least 2 hours set aside for this if you really want to take in the gardens fully    the bamboo forest was very underwhelming in my opinion  it s a short walk from the far side of tenryu ji temple so swing by if you are in the area  but don t expect to be wowed    the walk up to the monkey park is longer than you think and can be steep at times  it took 20 30 mins of uphill climb to get there but it is worth it if you are into seeing monkeys  the view from the top of the mountain is also very nice so the climb is not in vain   kyoto city    i visited nishiki market early in the morning  around 9am  and not much was open to came back around lunchtime following a  tea ceremony  nearby  the tea ceremony was very interesting and we were allowed to make our own matcha tea and was given a traditional japanese sweet to enjoy with our tea    i found nishiki market to be similar to kuromon market so didn t spend too long here other than to grab some street food  from the market you can also wander to the main shopping area of kyoto  it s easy to spend your whole day around this area if you are into shopping    nijo castle is a very nice place to visit  the castle itself was closed the day that i went but the gardens are nice to stroll around  i also visited the imperial palace within the same afternoon and it is another place steeped in history with very nice gardens surrounding it  entry into the imperial palace is free while entrance to nijo castle and its gardens are not  there are separate fees to visit the castle itself so keep that in mind  i walked between the two and while it is a long walk  i would rend it to see as much of day to day life in kyoto as you can   tokyo city  on our first day in tokyo  we ended up meeting a friend for lunch in shinjuku  by this time in our travels  we were all shopped out so really didn t wander around too much in shinjuku   also due to this  we decided that instead of exploring akihabara  shibuya or harajuku the next day  we would head to disneyland instead  we did end up going to meiji shrine that same afternoon and then quickly checking out shibuya and shibuya crossing on our way to dinner    as someone who isn t a big city person  tokyo is incredibly busy and can be very same ish  if you are also someone like that  i rend only spending around 3 days in tokyo  on my next trips to japan  how can i not visit again  i would either skip it entirely or just spend one or two nights here as a stopover to somewhere else    tsukiji market was incredibly packed the day i visited  30th dec  due to it being close to new years  the seafood here is as fresh as it gets but my rendation is to eat somewhere on the outskirts if it is busy within the market  the prices are very similar throughout and the quality is the same  to a layman s palate at least   disneyland    this was my first disneyland experience so it was special to me  be aware that only one ride has a single rider line  splash mountain  iirc  but there is a free fast pass system in place  if you arrive early then you are likely able to get on at least 3 of the main rides with a fast pass  just know that most of the fast passes for popular rides sell out by around 2pm  so prioritise your rides carefully    there is plenty to do here  so if you are going on lots of rides it is likely that you won t get to explore the entire park in one day  unless you plan to stay from opening to closing    there is a new beauty and the beast themed area of the park that is being built and it looks really promising  not sure when it is supposed to open  but when i was there you could see the castle in the distance  there were also some walkways that were hidden behind walls that were very obviously beauty and the beast themed  i would visit again just to see this area and explore the places i didn t get to see  i d also really like to go to disneysea next time   mt fuji    initially  the plan was to make our own way to lake kawaguchiko to view mt fuji but we ended up booking a chinese tour last minute  i don t speak a lick of any chinese dialect so take of that what you will haha  it was a small group tour  8 people all up  that took us to the mt fuji panoramic ropeway  lake kawaguchiko  lake yamanakako  the village of oshino and hakone shrine  we had excellent views of mt fuji from the ropeway  lake yamanakako and oshino as we had a very clear day    in the small village of oshino there are 8 small ponds that are fed by the melted snow from mt fuji  the average age in oshino is very high  with lots of people surviving to the 100s  so there is legend that if you drink the water thates from mt fuji  you will be granted longevity  if you wish to drink the water  the best place to get it is from the small shrine that sits near one of the main ponds and is located on the outside of the shop selling lots of pickles  sorry   this probably isn t the best description    the peace torii at hakone shrine is by far one of the most iconic places in the area and was very busy when our tour group visited at around 3pm  there was a line from the torii almost to the bottom of the stairs to get up to the shrine itself  my best guess is around 100 people  trying to get a photo with the peace torii  if this is a place that you wish to get photos at  then my suggestion is to get here early or be prepared to wait    on my next trip to japan  i will definitely try to stay in the hakone region for at least 2 3 days  as there is a lot of nature to see and i would love to experience onsen with a view of mt fuji  if you can afford it  i think staying at a ryokan with private onsen and mt fuji views is well worth the money  if you just want to see mt fuji  i rend picking your day and time carefully  as you may not get a clear view  i went during winter and got extremely lucky   the couple of days before and after had been very rainy and cloudy  i ve been told the best time to get a clear view is very early in the morning on what is predicted to be a clear day  if anyone else has insight into this please let me know for future trips   travelling to the airport    as always  head to the airport early to avoid anxiety  tokyo traffic can be very variable so you never know what might happen  my rendation is to take the airport limousine  bus  that departs from a couple different places around the city  i departed from ginza and the bus stop was easy to find  you can use your ic or suica card to pay if you want   overall  sorry this turned out longer than i expected but i hope it is of use to someone  please don t hesitate to ask questions or correct something that i might have gotten wrong  my favourite city to visit was definitely osaka and the surrounding areas  my biggest take away from this trip is to plan for extra time and time off  with my free time i was able to visit places that were rended by our hotel and other tourists i chatted to that i would never have thought about or known about  can t wait to go again ,1
specific question about the fuji hakone pass ,hi  as the title said  i have a question about this pass  there are 2 versions  one with round trip travel to tokyo  9 780 yen  and one without  7180 yen  they sell them at odawara  only the 7180 yen version  and shinjuku station  now  my itinerary is tokyo  gt  lake kawaguchiko  gt  hakone   odawara  gt  kyoto  i don t need the round trip  so i would like to buy the 7180 yen pass at shinjuko   a separate bus ticket to lake kawaguchiko  in total  it cost less than buying the round trip pass  do you know if they sell the 7180 pass at shinjuko station  or only the 9780 one  it s not very clear from odakyu website  i tried email them a few days ago but no answer yet thank you ,1

tokyo itinerary first  rough draft   a little over a week in tokyo  spring 2020,first timer  to this reddit and japan  here   hello japantravel  finding this sub reddit has been extremely validating  as so much of my mental space over the past few months has been trying to get some grasp on tokyo in preparation for our uing trip i ve been using custom google maps for planning  i entered in all locations that my partner and i are somewhat interested in seeing by type  and am now attempting to condense this into some sort of an itinerary we re going to tokyo and kyoto  kyoto in the middle of our trip  but i haven t begun kyoto itinerary preparations yet  i ll post once i have that sorted  but kyoto seems less intimidating  at least geographically  than tokyo below is a rough outline of our days in tokyo  very first draft  are these feasible  should we consider spending more time in tokyo and less time in kyoto  thoughts are greatly appreciated kyoto itinerary  here updated day 1  arrive in the afternoon  haneda  staying in shimokitazawa for first leg travel to shimokitazawadinner at shirubee izakayavintage shopping in shimokitazawa  pick up supplies at konbinibook  amp  beer if feeling up to it day 2  minato  roppongi day walk through aoyama cemetery in the morning to avoid crowds  cherry blossom season nezu museumlunch  maybe grilled lunch set at yanmo walk through omote sandosakurai tea experienceoptional  national art center  21 21 design sightsavoy for dinnermori art museumhead home day 3  west tokyo edo tokyo architectural museumkoganei parkoptional  studio ghibli museumoptional  inokashira parkkichijioji shoppingdinner at menya sakurai  minmin  or bakawarai junsuishopping in koenji  cocktail bookstorelive houses if have energy day 4  meguro  ebisu  shibuya homemade ramen muginae optional  hara museumtokyo metropolitan teien art museum  institute for nature studytokyo photographic art museumpotentially visit coworkerstonkatsu tonkiwalk around naka meguro  cherry blossoms promenadeget snoopy souvenirs at snoopy cafe  our moms are obsessed with snoopy   thus the explicit stop to get them presents optional  shibuya on the way home  jazz blues soul bar  etc day 5  travel day gotokuji temple in morning day 5 10  kyoto day 11  return to tokyo  staying in shinjuku for second leg optional  yayoi kusama museumshinjuku gyoen parkshopping in shinjukudinner in shinjukuoptional  shinjuku night walking tour  tokyo localized explore golden gai and lgbtq district day 12  koto  chiyoda city teamlab borderlessnaritasan fukagawa fud d sgg club imperial palace tour   1 pmoptional  national museum of modern artakihabara  super potato  m s optional  3331 arts chiyodajinbocho  used book district ramen in ginzanight in ginza day 13     yanensen senso jiwalk around asakusayanaka ginzayanaka cemeteryasakura museum of sculptureoptional  scai the bathhousetokyo national museum day 14    bunkyo and shibuya shopping koishikawa korakuen gardenoptional  return to ueno for national museum of western artshibuya shopping and bars  coffee elementary schoolmeiji shrine  nighttime day 15   return home thanks again ,1
usj vs universal studios in orlando ,hey  i ll probably be visiting this subreddit more frequently in the future  but i m definitely still at the part where i m only getting started with planning this trip  which honestly may not even happen for another year  so for now i m just collecting info on what looks good for an all adult family trip  one of the ideas that perked my interest was universal studios japan  i m curious if this is similar to disneysea or tokyo disneyland  where there are aspects that are shared between the disney parks  but each location has its own cultural flavor  however  my family has lived in florida for a while  and we have easier than most access to the orlando parks  so i m trying to figure out if usj is much  much closer to the original universal studios than disneysea is to disney world or the california disneyland  what info i ve dug up is mostly about the rides  which seem to be the same ones we have in orlando  is there anything particularly unique to usj  or would i be more or less safe just passing on this ,1
what am i missing by not staying more than 6 days ,technically 7 since my flight would leave at 8 30pm  but still so japan is probably  3 on the list of countries i want to visit the most that i haven t been to  i m finally getting around to planning a trip to it from march 1st to march 8th  my question is  what are the main things i ll be missing out on if i don t stay longer  reason i ask is because i actually have from feb 24th to march 8th to travel  but i  think  i would rather spend 3 days in each of two other countries  instead of 10 days or the whole 2 weeks in japan i haven t begun to seriously plan my trip yet  but off the top of my head some places that i think i would love to visit are  tokyo  including specially akibahara  mt  fuji   aokigahara  suicide  forest  kyoto and osaka  am i supposed to pick one or is it worth seeing both in such a relatively short period of time  any and all examples of classic japanese architecture  authentic traditional japanese food  specially ones that aren t sushi  udon  japanese curry  wagyu  seafood so is 6 7 days enough to do all that  is 6 7 days  too much  to do all that  and i can add more  what are the main best attractions in other areas of japan that i would be missing out on by not staying longer than one week  and what are the main best attractions in those areas of japan that i didn t list but that i can t forget about thank you ,1
