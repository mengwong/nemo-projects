Hi! Can someone tell me how the restrictions will be in April 2021? Also need help with daily budget. Thanks!,"/s

You can delete this, if this is isn't supposed to be here.

Lately, this has become really something nerve wrecking, people seem to assume this Sub can predict the future.

It became quite uncanny to scroll through new posts, basically only consisting of oracle-like questions and impossible help seeking.

I think it has affected this sub. I see less engaging overall and some of the better posts just disappear in the sheer amount of above said posts.

Furthermore, it is understandable to need help with budgetting or asking what it's like somewhere else. I mean, i guess that's what the sub is for.

Funnily enough, it seemed to become really common to avoid some info gathering before, google-ing and maybe even select a few countries to be more specific.

A world trip to maybe 6 different nations on 15 continents in Octember 2026 making a stop at the Moon station via Musk-Tours seems more specific, that some of the questions this sub is getting.

What are your thoughts about this?",solotravel,rakahr11
Is It Expensive Traveling With A Flexible Itinerary?,"I'm planning my first solo trip, hopefully, and optimistically sometime this summer, and I want this trip to be as open-ended and flexible as possible.  I've really taken to the concept of traveling with no concrete dates, in sort of a nomadic fashion, just staying in a city or country until I get bored and deciding a week or less out where I want to go next and when.  I've seen many posts here and follow many travel vlogers who travel like this and I've been inspired.

However, it seems to me that this style of travel would be much more expensive, particularly when booking flights on such short notice.  Am I wrong?  Is there a good strategy to save money on flights when traveling in this style?

To add more specifics, I'm planning on traveling to Turkey, and then from there, I would like to continue on to at least one or two more countries nearby in the Middle East or the Mediterranean.

Edit: Added more specifics.",solotravel,Custer_Had_It_Coming

Weak passport holders- how do you travel spontaneously?,"So I plan to travel once it is safe to travel. My idea initially was to take a break from my job and travel for 3 months backpacking across Europe. But seems like that plan will take a while due to the pandemic. 

My question is, how do people with weak passports plan their trips in respect to visa? I am from India so my passport isn't the best. I love on the spot plans and just hate booking  hotels in advance as sometimes I want to stay longer and sometimes I want to move fast. But due to visa issues I have to book everything in advance which sucks. How do you guys manage? Dummy booking? 

If this Europe plan doesn't work out, I am thinking of backpacking in Asia. Any suggestions? I have been to Thailand, bali and Malaysia already ( wouldn't mind repeating thou) . Again I don't know how to plan a flexible travel as most of the countries in Asia too require me to book flights or hotels in advance. Any tips?",solotravel,ruchigandhi22
Central America: Where is the Turf to Surf?,"Hello all,

I have been brainstorming travel ideas as life begins to slowly crawl towards normalcy again, and have been dying to go on a trip. I have just received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine (am an HCW) and am receiving my next dose in two weeks if it is worth mentioning. 

If possible, I'd like to plan this trip for early to mid May. My budget is ideally under $1500 for two weeks in a country in Central America. I also have $150 cashback bonus on my credit card that I plan on putting toward the cost of the flight. I am kind of a history geek as well, but am also interested in somewhere rich in hiking spots, with other activities available (allowing social distancing of course). I Imagine costs for the flight will amount to no more than $350 out of the total 1500. I have found several beachside AirBnbs in Nicaragua around $25 per night!

As for activities, the main thing on my list is finding the best beaches to surf on. I'm open to hiking, fishing, camping, swimming and the like. I live in the deep midwest, and have been a wage slave at my place of work since COVID - am needing to get away from that place for a bit. The language barrier doesn't mean much, I have a decent amount of traveling experience and know enough Spanish to get by. 

In what country can I get the most out of my money?Does 1500 seem like enough for a trip such as this? As the vaccines become distributed, will countries begin to adjust their policy regarding international travelers? 

I have been considering Nicaragua and Costa Rica the most. I've consulted some friends who have traveled Central America and I was told that Nicaragua is too dangerous and Costa Rica is too expensive. What do y'all think?

Tips on my Itinerary to Alaska,"I plan on taking a ten day trip to Alaska at the end of May (pending Covid). If I can get some input on my itinerary I would highly appreciate it. 

* Day One: Fly to Juneau and relax for the day
* Day Two: Hike West Glacier Trail or Mount Juneau
* Day Three: Early morning flight to Anchorage and explore the town
* Day Four: Wake up early with a rented car and drive to Denali National Park. Spend night there
* Day Five: Hike the Triple Lakes Trail 

I don't know where to go from there. If anyone has any suggestions of hikes I would love to hear about them.",solotravel,gb123334
Keep my stuff safe?,"How do you go about keeping your stuff safe when you’re at the beach wanting to swim or maybe at a swimming hole in the mountains? 

In the past, I usually have a big group of friends with me and some stay with the stuff while some others swim and stuff and we kinda rotate. 

I’ve literally put my stuff in a hole on the beach, covered it with palm leaves, and put a huge cement block over it. I watched it the entire time I was in the water lol. 

I’m carrying my wallet, phone, passport, etc. And I don’t want to lose these things.

Asking as a non solo traveler.,"I’ve been reading this sub for a while and thoroughly enjoying the many posts of travel and commenting when I can.

Puerto Rico itinerary recommendations,"Itinerary

I’m usually a very strict rule follower. 
The logic on why the cdc doesn’t allow people that have recently recovered from
Covid to travel makes no sense to me. The article says the risk of second reinfection is very low.  

I’m going to catch a lot of criticism for this, but I had Covid over thanksgiving so I’m going to Puerto Rico by myself anyway.  I’ll mask, social distance, test, etc. 

Here is my tentative itinerary:  my goal is seeing beaches and relaxing, with being able to say I saw most of the island.

5 Things That have made Solo Travel more Enjoyable to Me after 30+ Countries - Looking for Other Viewpoints from Travellers,"1)	A phone with battery to last 2 days and MAPS.ME offline maps application. During my early solo travels, getting lost was always something that I was afraid of. Maybe I was hesitant on exploring a neighbourhood because I suspected I wouldn’t find my way back. Maybe I was hesitant to follow a road because it could turn out to be a waste of time. No more of that after I discovered that offline maps can minimise all these issues. You always know where you are and even if you get lost, you can easily find your way back. This made me feel much freer and more increased my eagerness to explore different places in a city.

2)	A good selection of eBooks pre-selected before the trip. Any trip has downtime, maybe a long queue, recovering from a heavy meal at a restaurant or just these few hours at the end of the day to relax. I find that it’s good for the mind to keep busy reading something during those hours. It could be a book related to the place of visit or about the history of the country. It could also be something completely unrelated like a Victorian novel or a non-fiction book about a subject of your interest. It doesn’t matter as long as it compels you to read and keeps your mind busy.

3)	Packing light and a good backpack. When I first arrive in a new location, I don’t want to feel the stress of having to find my accommodation right away because of heavy luggage concerns. For that reason I pack as light as possible with the assumption I must be able to carry the weight throughout the days on my back at all times. It makes my travels a lot more free-spirited. I can wander around the city all day and only go to the hostel/hotel late at night and then leave again early in the morning to maximise sightseeing time.

4)	Leaving flexibility in my plans and being okay with missing MUST-SEE places if they don’t personally interest me. This has greatly freed up my travelling days. My previous approach included listing down let’s say 5 places that the guidebook recommended and then visiting them, this left me feeling like I am doing hard work and sometimes the places themselves felt overrated or not worth seeing. My new approach to mitigate this is to just decide for myself what I want to see – Lonely Planet says a museum on local religious art is number one attraction – great, but I don’t care much for religious art so I will rather spend my 2 hours walking around a neighbourhood and taking photos and trying out local food.

5)	(Advanced-Only) Going in blind without doing any research and not booking any accommodation ahead of time. After being to 30+ countries, travel can start to feel routine. You go to city x, sightsee, sleep at hotel x, then go to city y, sightsee, sleep at hotel y. It’s all a bit predictable. I wanted to feel a sense of chaos and adventure, so I tried out this philosophy on a recent trip to Morocco. I did very little research, the only accommodation I booked was the first night after landing. Then when in Morocco, if I felt like staying an extra day, I could do so, if transport options to go to place x were not available, I simply went to place y, it made the entire trip much more relaxed and spontaneous. There were also more moments of surprise as I had done little research so it felt like exploring the unknown sometimes. The only thing to note here is that this approach can only be done in countries with lower tourist demand (such as South Morocco in early December) as otherwise the price penalty from not booking ahead would be significant.",solotravel,rw1337

Making an informed decision about travel at this time,"Travel and tourism are contentious topics right now. For good reason. I see a lot of people on the fence about their planned travels. I'm not trying to shame you. But I'd like you to make as informed and honest a decision as possible. So I'd like to run through some common talking points I see about travel at this moment.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Tourism-reliant places desperately need my money**

This is an unfortunate reality. But it's worth asking yourself one thing. Is this really why you're going on a vacation? If it were your largest motivator, why would a donation not suffice? My favorite clubs are suffering right now too. And yet, it would not make sense for me to go clubbing. Nor would it be a charitable act.

**I am following all the rules**

I think we all agree that just because you can doesn't really mean you should. In many parts of the US, local regulations say you're able to go around without a mask. We know unequivocally that this is wrong. Despite it being allowed within the rules it puts everyone around you in harm's way.

**I'm taking all the necessary safety precautions**

For one, as we all know, a negative result is not a guarantee that you are COVID-free. This puts your flight attendants, pilots, airport/airline staff, taxi drivers, hospitality staff all at needless risk.

Two, the biggest safety precaution that our public health experts have advocated has been ""stay home"". You cannot be abiding by all the recommended safety precautions given that you've violated the biggest one.

**I will be fine even if I get sick**

I'm trying to foster an honest discussion. So honestly, chances are, yes. People on reddit tend to be younger and you'll likely make it out OK. But as people who love to travel, I have to imagine part of the reason why is because you genuinely love the different people and cultures of the world.

Show your compassion and love for these people now with your patience. They are excited for you to come back as much as you are to see them. But there is a time and place. And while it is not now, it will come soon.

--------------------------------------------------------

I know this has been a tremendously difficult experience. But normalcy is so close. A vaccine is within grasp and you will have it soon. Better yet, a vaccine will make your travel experiences exponentially better. And of course, the people and places you love around the world will be much safer too.

I know people can't stay inside their home indefinitely. You need to leave the house once in a while, if just for your sanity. Try local day trips that have minimal exposure to others. I've hiked this year more than I ever have in my life!

And at risk of sounding privileged, consider what a gift time can be. I have never had so much free time in my life before. I've started reading again. I've started playing my cello again after a decade away. I'm taking courses in statistics (for my career) and Spanish (for my future travels). My diet and exercise have never been better! While these luxuries are not something everyone obviously has access to, I imagine if you are considering travel/vacations right now these might be accessible to you too.

Ultimately, I'm a stranger on the Internet and the decision is yours alone. But I think it's important to be honest with oneself about your motivations before making a decision. I hope I've helped in some way to inform an honest assessment when you make your choice.",solotravel,blue_doki
When to travel and how to afford it?,"So I am a teenager who has been fortunate enough to be on my own solotrip once ... and I loved it! I am taking a gap year in two years and recently started saving to afford my plans and started planning it in more detail. But this made me wonder; how old were you guys when you started to travel and does it stop at a certain age? I am just afraid I wouldn’t get to experience many countries on my gap year except at the expense of experiencing countries in-depth. And if I dont experience many countries on my gap year, I am afraid I will never visit them in my life. Is this assumption some-What true? 

On the economic aspect, how do you afford travelling so much to so many countries and how do you budget for them?

Use up all my hotel points and still meet people for my birthday trip to Central Europe?,"I've done plenty of solo traveling in the past, stayed at hostels, hotels, airbnb's, flown first class and taken obscure local trains. I also have really been into gathering hotel and airline points from credit cards the last 5 years, and using them mostly to fly better airline classes when the flight is over 8 hours long. I've only occasionally used hotel points, preferring to do bnbs and hostels when traveling solo to save money and meet people more.

But my 30th birthday is coming up this summer, so I booked a trip to Central Europe (Budapest, Vienna, and Prague), and I want to treat myself for this one. 
I have tons of points I could use for swanky hotels in these cities, but I feel I would miss out on meeting people, and end up feeling very alone during the trip. On the other hand, if I have the hotel points why not use them before they get devalued into oblivion and save the money for other stuff? 

Are there ways for me to meet people outside of hostels and guesthouses? Or could I drop into a nearby hostel anyway to meet people that way? I'm torn. I've checked out a few apps and they look pretty dodgy and not reliable enough to meet people through.",solotravel,philsworth
What do I do about this messy situation?,"Hey there,

So I'm sure I'll get shit on more than anything for this because of COVID so I'll preface that I:

* Am vaccinated
* Will wear a mask and face shield and use hand sanitizer 1,000 times
* Will be getting tested multiple times, and will not be ""doing tourist shit"" or interacting with the locals and will quarantine when I get there and when I get back.

**So my question is:**

I have a flight scheduled for January 23rd from Newark to Morocco (actually it's Alaska to Newark to Morocco but they are two separate bookings). My flights from NY&gt;MA and back were wicked cheap, about half the price of the next cheapest flight which should have been my first red flag. I booked with TAP Portugal and didn't really think anything of it.

Well, I mention my flight to someone on Facebook and they say ""oh no, TAP is horrible"". They had apparently canceled her flights **three times**(!) and refuse to issue a refund. Like basically it's a known scam airline that sells crazy cheap flights and then cancels 90% of them last-minute, never issuing any refunds. I looked online and saw dozens and dozens and dozens of extremely angry reviews.

So I called TAP Portugal customer service and... the number doesn't work. Like, the airline's number just doesn't work. I try several other numbers associated with the airline, none of them work. Expedia, which I used to buy the ticket, basically washed their hands of it. ""We can't call them if you can't"" kinda deal. Plus the airline set the cancellation fee at **$400-fucking-dollars**.

So I contact my bank to see if they can chargeback. They can't, because despite the ticket being purchased a week ago it still hasn't posted and they can't touch a charge until it's posted.

**So I'm wondering:**

* Does anyone have experience with international flights with TAP Portugal?
* Should I just go with the hopes that the flight will actually run, and run the risk of having it canceled last minute and being stranded in NYC?
* Buy another fucking ticket and eat the cost of the budget ticket, with the off-chance possibility that they might refund me?

Thank you!",solotravel,Katelyn89
Travel plans for France // Greater western EU trip: Looking for suggestions to and tips to get me started as a first time traveller,"I know this post is perhaps a bit more vague than the other ones here, but I don't have any precise plans for travel quite yet, just that I know after all this pandemic nonsense is said and done I *need* to get out of the country. I was specifically reserving 2020 for my ""fuck it, I'm going to travel the world"" year, and my new company gives me a month of vacation. So, might as well start planning now.

I know French and some German, and France has always been a destination I'd love to tour, but I need suggestions for good cities and sites to visit because it has just been difficult to wade through all the tourist-adevertisement laden stuff, I don't actually have that much interest in Paris, but would love to see and tour some of the lesser known chateaus and countryside towns. If you guys know of any particularly pretty hidden gems. If I have the time and money, I might do a bit of backpacking/touring more of France and western Europe in general, specifically I'd love to visit Berlin and Lisbon, I also have friends from my time volunteering scattered around Europe (London, Rome, Geneva, Solo). So, if there are generally any ""must sees"" or ""If you're going to visit X region, here's everything I would look into"". That'd be awesome!

Again, I know this is kinda vague and a lot, but as a first timer I'm not looking for an encyclopedia or everything to be spoon fed. Just some ""Hey, if you like X, these regions have nice stuff"". Because trying to get the big-picture stuff sifted from all the tourism-laden websites is... Difficult, and I'd like recommendations from other travelers :)",solotravel,Cendruex
"Will Covid-19 or the issue of ""over-tourism"" make you to rethink your plans?","Before Covid hit there were countless articles about over-tourism (too many tourists) in places like Paris, Rome, Prague, Barcelona, Venice, etc. Then Covid-19 hit and they went deserted. Have any of you changed your plans (or thought about changing your plans) to avoid contributing to the  problem in the future or maybe avoid crowds where you could more easily get an air-borne disease as crowds are returning? Does anyone live in a city/region that gets too many tourists?

My own city Sofia was becoming way too touristy in 2019 and many here have complained of it losing its authenticity. I quote a friend ""Hearing foreign speech is cool during the first 100 times, after that it makes you feel like the place has been infiltrated and hijacked"" (must be a subconscious thing from prehistoric tribalism lol). Most places where people have been friendly to me are either those where there aren't that many tourists/foreigners (genuine curiosity and interest) OR those that literally rely on tourist money to survive (not very genuine). Locals in cities that are big enough to survive even without foreign tourism are usually less accommodating/welcoming and couldn't care less. Anyone notice this pattern?

The pandemic showed that tourism is a very volatile sector and societies who rely only on it need to diversify. As for me, I've decided to travel to less popular parts of countries (Southeastern/Eastern Poland, Eastern Hungary, Puglia in Italy) and only stick to a few popular touristy places where I really love the place &amp; local culture, but visit them less often (Madeira, Krakow, Stockholm, etc.). And you?

Edit: 2nd and 3rd tier places in Europe worth checking imo: Bamberg, Erfurt, Eisenach/Wartburg, Visby/Gotland, Przemysl, Tarnow, Morskie Oko, Debrecen, Balaton lake, Ruse, Sliven, Yambol, Stara Zagora, Bari and Lecce.",solotravel,martinotbulgaria

Is there a list of hostels that have permanently closed this year?,"I've seen a little discussion about this on r/solotravel but not as much as I expected to. I’m curious about which hostels have closed permanently due to this year’s lack of travel (and how many have closed in general). I know there are a few threads about certain hostels that have closed, but I’m wondering if it would be possible to make a mega-list of hostels that have closed permanently so that people who have spent time there have a place online to pour one out for the places that meant something to them, or to just know that a place they used to love (or hate) has closed up shop. 

These are the ones I know of off the top of my head that have closed permanently. I can keep the list updated if the mods are cool with it:

\- Retox (Budapest) 

\- HI Hostel (Austin, TX, USA)

&amp;#x200B;

I think the aspect of solo travel I miss the most is staying at the kind of hostel that feels more like home than your actual home – the kind of place that you get stuck at for way too long because you can't bear to check out. I've been donating a bit on [AdoptAHostel](https://www.adoptahostel.com/), but I know that there are a lot of beloved hostels that aren't on there, and I'm not sure how much it helps in the face of such huge hostel income losses.

Difference in behavior traveling solo vs a group,"Since I haven't been able to travel much I was thinking about past trips, looking through old photos, etc.  I noticed that the trips where I traveled  solo I act completely different.  My experiences ended up being completely different even in places that were the same. It was consistent during domestic (US) and overseas trips. 

In groups I'm shy, I never meet any locals, I only spend time with friends, I don't do much site seeing.  It's generally just my girls and I hanging out in a different location.  I don't feel like I get much of a 'trip' out of it but I come back fresh and relaxed abd still look back on those trips as fulfilling.  

Solo I'm almost extroverted, I meet a ton of locals, go site seeing, do excursions, stay in dumpy hostels/airbnb's, turn on a Tinder account that just says ""Here on vacation"", go out more.  I generally look back on these trips as fulfilling as well and definitely more of an adventure, however I come back exhausted and almost needing a couple days to just chill.  

Both are great and I think I would want to continue both but it took a long break from travel to notice the differences.",solotravel,Street_archer_87

Sad that I won't be able to travel again," I have a feeling the COVID-19 pandemic will last at least two years just like the Spanish Flu (1918-1920), I'm guessing mid 2022. In January 2020, I booked a cheap roundtrip airline ticket from New York, New York to Miami, Florida for the end of March 2020. Then COVID-19 forced me to cancelled my ticket two days before departure. I was really looking forward to my trip. If I knew this was going to happen, I would've never bought a ticket in the first place. I'm kind of worried I won't be able to use my airline credit at all since the ticket was nonrefundable and it expires in December 2021, hopefully the airline will extend it. I would've continued my trip to Florida, but beaches and restaurants were closed at 5pm, city curfew at 10pm and Disney World was closed indefinitely, so there was no point of me going with all those restrictions. I have this feeling that I have to wait five years to start traveling again meaning no mask, no social distancing and no quarantine. I'm sick and tired of staying home all the time, not going anywhere at all while extremely bored. I rather be staring out of an airplane window, instead of my living room window looking at trees. This pandemic is making me waste my 20s away, the age range I'm suppose to enjoy (I turned 24 two days ago). Every time I look at the photos/videos of my first solo trip in May 2019 at the age of 22, I start to smile, wishing I can go back to 2019. Don't take life for granted as they say.

Atlas Obscura trips - any experience?,"While travel still seems like a bit of a pipe dream at the moment, I'm considering signing up for a group trip when it looks more realistic. I'm considering the standards (Contiki, TopDeck, G Adventures), but saw on an old Reddit post that Atlas Obscura actually [hosts group travel](https://www.atlasobscura.com/unusual-trips/all#2021%20trips).

Has anyone ever been on one of these trips? I'm intrigued by their offerings, especially the [space-themed Russia trip](https://atlasobscura.com/unusual-trips/moscow-soviet-space), which seems incredible (I'm really interested in space travel).

Disclaimer (based on other threads I've read where people have asked about organised group travel): I'm aware that these are expensive and it would be cheaper to organise myself; I'm very comfortable organising my own trips, just keen to give some group travel a go later in the year and these seem like very unique trips.",solotravel,eclipse--mints
"Anyone like traveling to places on the basis of ""who else do you know has gone to x""?","Something was pointed out to me by my family over the holidays(via Zoom). My travel plans have shifted in the year before the pandemic to look for stuff that aren't ""regular"" destinations in earnest.

 I have visited my share of more ""popular"" destinations (Paris, London etc.) and certainly enjoy them. I am not a person who degrades anyone for their choice of travel. I have a great aunt who spoke with me about wanting to go to Rome on her first international trip and said ""but that's just too boring for you"" and I reassured her that any place she wants to go is a good trip for her.

 I mention this because I was told that I have begun to look at places on the basis of the question ""do you know anyone who has traveled to x"" or ""who else do you know has gone to x.""  I was told that I am doing this just to shock people and gain credibility with other travelers as well as one-upping others. I had never thought of it like that, but I had mentioned that I would really like to see Iran and Saudi Arabia. These are two places that have intrigued me since I was young, but as a solo woman traveler, I never thought I'd get the chance. I have read more and more about them and it looks like they are potential options, but I have been told that I would only be doing it because it is uncommon(though probably not on this sub).

I was thinking about it and I guess that is part of the appeal of some places. I'd like to visit the Faroe Island and Svalbard. I'd love to do the Trans Siberian railway and Beijing to Lhasa one as well. These are all places that look cool but am I doing it just because it is less common? My family and friends do not believe that these are places that are actually on anyone's bucket list. They intrigued me for what they are but I can't deny that there is a part of me that thinks ""I will be going somewhere that no one I know would venture to."" It feels adventurous. I was the first person in my family to visit Japan(my first solo trip) and everyone had a meltdown(except my deceased father who accurately predicted that it would be the first of many journeys), and now, as much as I love Japan, it feels a little pedestrian. I'd love to go back, but to explore the more out of the way places.

Sorry, this was long and rabmly, but I am just thrown off a bit, feeling like perhaps my motives for travel are wrong?",solotravel,dezayek
How do you decide to drive or fly?,"I had some flight vouchers which were only good for travel within the US.  I decided to book a flight to DC, rent a car and explore various battlefields from the Civil War and revolution.  Now that I'm shopping for rental cars, I realize I've made a terrible mistake.  The flight may be free, but the rental car + parking at my hometown airport will add up to almost $1000!   I think I will end up cancelling the flight and driving down.  If you are going alone, where do you draw the line on driving vs. flying?",solotravel,Excellent-Emu-5710
Travelling in Covid as a SOLO teenage (19M) traveller: Poland – Slovakia - Hungary; August/September 2020,"We can all agree since the lockdown, life has taken an interesting route. Personally, my adventure to Switzerland were cancelled and a holiday to Berlin was put on hold. priorities began to focus on other areas of life and no longer being in and out the airports.

My last solo trip was back in January to Portugal, so I was ready for a trip. fortunately, I booked a cheap flight to Palermo and spent 3 nights there to fuel the spark and getting into the zone. March to July (4months) slowly passed and now its time to travel!

Finally made it to my hostel **Bubble Hostel (£5 a night)** after a budget friendly flight to the airport located 15k outside of the centre. When you first step foot outside any airport, the taxis are the first line of defence, but you got to ignore them and find a bus/metro or a train– in Krakow’s case, a bus was the option. Travelling solo allows you to listen to music so always have the freshest Spotify playlist prepared you’re your adventure.

Arriving from the UK were BoJo was doing his best impersonation of Vicky Pollard (Picture Daily mirror of this). You would expect the clubs and bar crawl to be closed... You are wrong! Whilst I was in Poland, I went on the same bar crawl 5 times! All nightclubs open until 5am and later. It seems to me that Covid must go to sleep at midnight.  Forget the new normal because I am now back in the normal. 1m floor signs and masks still to be worn in indoor spaces, Gyms fully open and no need to book. This was a blessing as gyms only reopened later on in the UK...and of course closed again

During my month in ‘Eastern’ Europe you allocentrics may call it - to me its Central Europe. It seemed very calm and controlled compared to the state in the UK. It continued like this for the whole month.

The flight situation was the there was no blocking of seats, however on all three flights I experienced, there was the luxury of a row to myself. The bus situation is that there are no blocking of seats and it seemed normal. The only thing what was different is that you have to wear a masks in both areas

Headphones in and listening to the varies songs and occasionally podcast – I ventured on the explore the main attractions of Krakow (Pictures). There are positives travelling in Covid, as the sites become quieter and as a tourist, it is an opportunity to appreciate the sites. On the other hand, less people on the bar crawls, but the locals did not disappoint.

When visiting a new country, it is always best to learn a few words to impress the locals whenever you’re in a bar and had too much to drink. I experienced many friendly people and never felt unsafe in Poland as everyone I met was very welcoming. In my first hostel, I met a few German lads who I had a chat to about the city they were from and my limited knowledge on to Bundesliga. Travelling around, I feel like football is a universal language (Especially being from Manchester) as people smile when you just mention a few players from their country or team.

3 days into Krakow, I reluctantly switched hostels to **Willa Retro Hostel (£9 a night)** as I enjoyed the free coffee/tea and breakfast offered by the Bubble Hostel. In the new hostels garden was a very chilled vibe with music and socializing taking place.A complete opposite to what lockdown offered in the months of April and May. At this point, my excitement levels jumped despite I had no plans on the coming month.

A few days later, I agreed on an itinerary exploring the southern areas of Poland. This include the cities of Katowice – Wroclaw – Lodz – Warsaw – Lublin – Zakopane (via Krakow). Spontaneously after a chat to a stranger at 4am in a Krakow nightclub I decided to go to Budapest BUT turns out I had to go before the 1st September as Hungary were closing their borders. I did not know this prior purchasing the Flixbus tickets from Krakow – Kosice (Slovakia) then Kosice – Budapest.

Sad to be leaving Krakow I ventured on to Katowice just for the night. I can’t say much about this city but around this time there were protest against the current government on their views on gay rights so I spectated a fairly peaceful protest in the city centre. **Hostel Sentral (£9 a night)** was seen as a bargain as I was one of two people in my dorm - another common theme

Few hours on the morning bus ride to Wroclaw was relaxing as there was no people around me. This was a regular theme throughout my trip. Travelling in Covid was a dream for exploring. Wroclaw was a lovely surprise due to it reminding me what Krakow was like with the beautiful architecture. Labelled as a university city, I did notice the student scene as the parks on the river were full of life with people drinking and just socializing. This was a completely different approach to the UK due to no more than 6 people meeting up. Still amazed that the gyms still open and the evening atmosphere in the centre still alive. You wouldn’t see a soul enjoying life in the major cities of the UK. I didn’t stay much in **Absynt Hostel (£6 a night)** as there were many areas to check out. (Pictures of stadium, centre and park) It had that big city feel which I wernt expecting but I can see this city picking up a reputation and I would recommend anyone to visit

On to the lesser known cities of Poland – Lodz. Another cheap and safe journey by Flixbus and I was greeted by the presence of nothing. A massive bus station filled with nothing. I don’t know if this is because of Covid or the bus station is too big for the city?

The same greeting, I had from the bus station was the same greeting I had when I entered my dorm at the **Cynamon Hostel (£8 a night)** Nothing. No one entered my room for the next 3 nights I was there, and I’m convinced there was no one else in the entire hostel. An entire hostel for £24 pounds for 3 nights. Royalty. Lodz isn’t too popular with tourist, but I’m surprised to see no domestic tourists. It was the weekend, so it gave me an opportunity to check out the nightlife. Over this weekend I watched the demolition Bayern Munich did to Barcelona.. watched on Bein sport with some guys from the Middle East. No English spoken it seems in these parts of Poland and so just ordering a simple drink was complicated. I laughed with the locals, whilst not understanding a word but the music was good!

Warsaw... second time in Warsaw for me after visiting with friends back in March 2019. One of my favourite buildings is located in this city (Palace of Cultural &amp; Science) but apart from that..eurgh. When travelling, I think when you travel to the capital, it does not represent the country, so travelling to the second cities to countries it gives a fairer review of a country. One of the many few positives Warsaw holds is that there’s an impressive beach where you can chill! **City View Lucka Hostel (£5 a night).** Not the best hostel but I was bound to encounter a negative hostel experience especially when hopping from hostel to hostel. Moving on..

Travelling again with Flixbus to the next city on the eastern side of Poland which is Lublin. Prior to coming to this surprisingly close-knit town, I didn’t do any research as I wanted to be surprised.. and I was! A standard old town filled with the coloured buildings and hosting an impressive castle casting over the town. I would recommend this place and recommend the hostel as well **Folk Hostel (£8 a night).** Finally I weren’t alone in a dorm, as I got talking to a few of the tourist. Just by luck a Hungarian girl was staying in the dorm as I ended up getting her contacts as I planned to visit Budapest. Also, a hostel first for me was that a dog was staying in the room, was a very cute dog and caused no problem aww. The main attraction in this town is the Concentration Camp located on the outskirts of the city. Vast area with a handful of people in the grounds. Highly recommended if your interested in the history of the surroundings.

Flixbus again of course back to where it all started. How much has Krakow changed with Covid restrictions since I was last there a few weeks ago? Turns out, not much as I met up with the bar crawl lads and seshed to 6am with varies nationalities including France, Netherlands and even the UK.  As a solo traveller it is a great way to meet people and connect with as when you’ve had a drink you would make friends with anybody. In and out of hostels It is always good to splash out (not too much) on an apartment for a few days to recharge the batteries. A dumb move by me was the book an apartment by the train station - **JM Rooms Lubicz 10 (£15 a night)** .. wonder why it was so cheap!

Afternoon bus to the hidden beauty of Zakopane. Only 3 hours from Krakow and I highly recommend visiting if you ever get the opportunity. I expect it to be packed because of the many walking routes you can do in summer, in contrast to the skiing in winter. I really did get that Austrian mountains vibe but with such cheap prices. One to visit again in the future, unreal views UNREAL. **Willa Mavi (£13 a night)** topped it for me as I decide to stay in apartment with views of the mountains. BONUS: it had a bathtub! When you visit the bordering regions of Poland/Slovakia, you got to check out the ‘Morskio Oko’. Even in these Covid times, get to the bus station early to beat the crowds because you would like the lake for yourself.

A completely different side of Poland I thought id never encounter with the fresh air and amazing views. I returned to Krakow feeling content knowing it was the weekend, so I had to go on a bar crawl on my last night of Krakow. I sure did that and stayed out until 6… No 10pm pubs shutting here but hey ho, you people in the UK had 50% off food.

Next day was off to a new place in a new country – Kosice, Slovakia. Was a lengthy bus journey and no trouble crossing the border. I thought because of Covid there would be trouble but no there was no problem whatsoever but could I leave Slovakia and enter Hungary... who knows lets risk it.

It’s a shame for Slovakia because it is positioned in between their well-known neighbours of Poland &amp; Hungary. I personally not too interested in the country and yes I have been to the capital - Bratislava last year (not solo).

My mind was just thinking about if I can enter Hungary, but I would have to take a overnight train to Ruzemberok then a bus down to Budapest. Thankfully, no issues on crossing the borders. The date was 31/08/2020 so one day just before the borders close. From the bus station to the hostel was just an easy metro ride to the centre. It really is not hard to direct your way around the major cities of Europe just follow the maps on offer and use google maps. The metro to the centre was a quick ride and I was soon ready to check in…but it was 7am. Most hostels/hostels accept check ins at 2pm so knowing this I booked the night before and with hope I could sleep the morning away in Budapest. Long story short that was not possible. After chatting to an Italian girl about her city Torino, who was working in the **Hostel One Basilica (£5 a night)** I explored the attractions such as the Parliament Building, Chain Bridge and many more.  The busiest attraction would be the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, but we are in a global pandemic.

The nightlife in Budapest did not disappoint despites it was Covid. Luckily my hostel was full of outgoing people who worked in the hostel and knew the best places to party. A tip for any student travelling is to research the citys Erasmus page and check if there are any events. This is because the beer tends to be cheaper!!! I was successful in my search for an Erasmus night. The entry was cheap, and the drinks were cheap but of course they were because Budapest is cheap!! So many people in these Covid times into a strange nightclub with many corridors to apply. Just a few hours ago I was talking to my mates how we miss a normal night out..oops. Further few nights were spent in the capital and I met up with the same girl from Lublin. She showed me around the city, and we talk about many different topics.

Thankfully I could escape Hungary as i could catch my flight to Zakynthos in Greece where my solo adventure would end. Party time!

Do you collect anything uniquely meaningful to you when you travel?,"I have a shoebox full of mementos from the time I lived in Europe - city maps, wristbands, concert tickets, restaurant menus, drink coasters, notes from friends, newspaper clippings, you name it. 

I was a *very* broke university student, so I couldn’t afford many meaningful souvenirs. I had to skip out on a lot of paid museums and restaurants for the same reason. Almost all of my money went toward Flixbus or budget Ryanair flights, spontaneous hostel reservations, and quick stops at grocery stores for beer and whatever cheap groceries I found affordable enough to hold me over for my time there (usually bread, a protein, and my fair share of greasy street food).

I may not have gotten the most in-depth cultural experience in each country, but it was a uniquely humble method of diving in and adapting to each new place. I’m not from a wealthy family whatsoever, so the worldly thinking I developed was life changing. The memories I made were well worth the struggles. I keep telling myself I’ll go back to some of my favorites someday - I think now I can afford a few €15 meals :) 

I’m doing better for myself now, much less vagabond but trying to keep up my share of unique travels. Feeling deprived (thanks COVID), I pulled my box from the back of a shelf for the first time in about 3 years and was understandably hit with a massive wave of nostalgia. Sure, it’s just a box of scraps, but to me it’s tangible proof that this weird, recurring dream I hold so dearly in the back of my mind was once reality. It’s a tiny reminder of the sweet, sweet freedom I once felt as a student, holding these same maps in these same hands as I happily navigated myself through new worlds with pure, bare-boned happiness. I realized I’ll never be able to share these feelings and bits of memories with anyone but myself but that’s what makes the old shoebox so beautiful.

"Anyone have experience driving from the US to Monterrey, Mexico?","I have a three-month furlough coming up this summer and I'd like to to something fun. Last time I had a furlough, I went to Peru for a month. This time I'm thinking of an extended stay in Mexico, specifically Monterrey.

I've been to Mexico a number of times including studying in Mazatlan and a two week solo trip to Oaxaca and Puebla in 2018. All the same, I've never drove my own vehicle in a foreign country. Is the road from Laredo to Monterey safe? Is there anything I should know about driving in that part of Mexico? I live in New Mexico but specifically chose the Laredo route, as it would require the least solo driving in Mexico. I know I have to purchase insurance when I cross, but I don't know any specifics of that. I'm honestly also interested in getting all the way down to Mexico City and seeing Guanajato and San Luis Potosi on the way, but that seems quite overwhelming to me.

Access to the vaccine is relatively unclear at this point, though it seems likely that here in Germany you will be able to get a vaccine as a healthy person in summer. To be safe I was thinking about putting in three weeks in late November/early December. But what to do with the rest? I'm afraid of planning - let's say three weeks in June and then losing out because of bad luck. That's why I'm then considering to spread it out a bit with shorter trips. Current plan looks like this: 

- July: 2 weeks in Spain (or somewhere else in Europe)

- September: 2 weeks in the US (or someplace else with a large amount of vaccinated people)

- December: 3 weeks in Mexico 

Do you think this is realistic or should I spread it out further with smaller trips? Problem is the more trips you take the more money you spend and only being at work for 3/4 weeks for half of the year sounds like it'd break up my workflow too much.",solotravel,No_Contact_3998

How much money would I realistically need to travel continuously for 3-6 months?,"I am a 21 year old located in Australia. Initially I was very career-driven but now I am starting to realise that COVID aside, I may never be in a better position to travel than I am now.

I am currently on a $63k salary with about $10k in savings. I would like to quit my job this/next year (depending on the COVID situation) and travel for a few months before getting another job. I am single and live pretty cheaply, so I envisage my savings increasing over the next few months.

I have an undergraduate law degree and about 4 years of work experience behind me, so i feel fairly confident that I wouldn’t be rendered unemployable by an extended travel period.

Australia Working Holiday!... or Not. Having Problems with Anxiety and Solo Travelling.,"Hi all. I’m hoping to go on a 417 Australian Working Holiday in January 2022 (assuming that boarders are open, and things are relatively back to ‘normal’) and so, looking for some advice. 

I’ve really dreamt of this trip for the last 2 - 3 years, researched and planned in depth, and used it as motivation to get to the end of uni (it would be a post-graduate travel gap year). At some points, it’s been all I could think about; the sun on my skin, seeing the Blue Mountains, taking a surf lesson, sailing the Whitsundays... However, now that it’s becoming ‘real’ and I’m getting closer to having to make actual decisions e.g applying for a visa and booking flights, I’m getting a bit nervous. I’m a fairly reserved and introverted person with, to be honest, a fair amount of general and social anxiety. I’ve lived by myself, a few hours from home, for the last year, and have traveled both locally and abroad many times before - with friends and family. Here, on holidays, I usually love every minute, largely the ‘doing’ element; the activities, the sights and experiences etc. but I’ve not travelled by myself before, let alone stayed in a hostel, and now, am questioning whether I can follow through with what I would love to do vs. what I’m capable of doing. A few family members, who I’m sure mean well, have basically told me not to go, due to my quietness and / or because of going by myself (I don’t know any friends or family who are either not in uni or work, or who are financially stable enough etc.), whilst my best friend encourages me to go for it.

So, any tips / experiences / suggestions for:
- Solo travelling for the first time (for females, in particular). 
- Anxiety and travelling. 
- Solo travelling / anxiety whilst on an Australian Working Holiday. 

(Please try to be constructive, not criticising.)

Happy New Year (and Decade!),"Hey folks! 

It’s been an interesting year to say the least haha - and I’m looking forward to being able to (solo) travel again :)

An interesting experience with solo travel - last year I traveled by myself to Quebec City for New Years (and I’ve done solo New Years another time in Montreal) and had a lot of fun with folks I met there!

Today as I’m wishing people a Happy New Year, besides my family, funny enough the group that we formed last year (also on WhatsApp) for New Years feels more like the group of people I’d love to spend another New Year’s Eve with!

There’s something quite fascinating about the relationships you make when you solo travel - neither of you expect much from the people long term - but for the time y’all are together, it does feel like a great community :)

Happy New Year y’all - and I’m optimistic about things getting better down the line :)

Travel Insurance,"Bit of a confession here, some of you will probably think its stupid of me but I havent really bought travel insurance for most of my trips, especially for the two 'multi countries' trips. Thankfully nothing happened to me for them, e.g. ended up in the hospital/lost some valuables etc.

Obviously, this is bad but has anyone else just go ahead and travel without them, and to those who gets travel insurance like normal people, which one do you suggest on getting (UK based if that helps). Reasons I dont get it is because, either I get really excited and forget about it or just see it as another expense I could get away without. But I know if shit hits then fan, it will cost me much more than getting one in the first place.

To those who have claimed, what happened and how does the process go, e.g. losing an item on a trip.

Getting robbed and losing visa advice/experiences,"I’m trying to understand what people do in the case of getting robbed when moving between locations — ie where you haven’t been able to stow your passport and backup cash and card at a hotel/hostel. 

Worst case scenario you lose it all, and find yourself without a passport, phone, cash/cards, your backpack, etc. 

I know you need to make your way to an embassy, but how do you do that with no money or identification? I’m assuming it would be incredibly difficult to get a replacement CC in a foreign country within any reasonable timeframe, and you have no identification for someone to wire you money. Without relying on a good Samaritan, what do you do?

"To people that are traveling during this time, are you enjoying it?","Was just thinking recently about like my goals to live abroad and travel with the mindset of “I’ll do this when the pandemic ends”. I realized part of the desire to travel for me is not just like sightseeing and doing outdoorsy things alone, but it’s like going to museums, parties, nightclubs, and restaurants, meeting people in different languages—things that likely aren’t options in many places. So if I were to actually travel now, I don’t even think I would have as much fun—I could just travel an hour outside my city and go hiking or something.

Question(s) about WHV in Oz/ NZ,"I plan to apply for one of these in early 2022 so I can have a longer-term, sustained travel through Oceania without cutting too deep into my nest egg for further SEA/ steppe solo travel afterwards. 

I know that the visa is predicated on having short-term, non-career based jobs during the stint. My question is, besides seasonal/farmhand, what is actually allowed by this, and how is the legality determined? 

I have a few years of experience as a semi-nomadic engineer in mechanical, structural, and manufacturing environments. Would something like a term-limited contract job in this field be allowed? Either something like a graduate-level apprenticeship, lab/manu technician, or construction job in structures/hvac besides unskilled labor? I understand the availability of them is nigh-unpredictable, I’m more so curious if it’s even legally pursuable. 

Also, it seems like completion of a WHV has no impact on future long-term visa acceptance. Is this correct? I ask because I’m fairly certain to relocate from USA to either NZ or Germany permanently after 10-15 years of a semi nomadic living, and having completed my degree in Germany I have an advantage there. Would a year of life/work in NZ have no impact at all on future consideration?

Australian Visa,"I cant find a proper group for this question, but I need help!

Hello! In May 2019 I went to Perth on a working holiday visa (first year) to be an aupair. I left August 28 so I could go back home to Toronto and go to school. While I was there I met my boyfriend and have since decided to move to Perth to go be with him. I know right now with covid we will be waiting for a bit and trust me I'm well aware of that whole situation. My question is this: Can I apply for the second Working holiday visa, or is there a time frame I missed? I heard that I may not be ablate enter for another 3 years? Or if there is an option to reapply for the first working holiday? When I go next I want to be there for a year and hopefully apply for a partner visa while I'm there, not yet though. I'm just confused as to what visa would work! I've looked everywhere. Thanks!

\*UPDATE\*

Just wanted to add some information after reading some comments. I'm currently 20 years old. I didn't do any of the needed work in order to qualify for a second working holiday. I arrived May 2019 and left August 2019, therefore my visa was good until around May 2020. So it has since then expired. My hope was being able to possibly reapply for the first one and then do the work, but I no longer think this is the case though it would be easier. I'm looking at partner visas but they're very expensive and take a while to process. I'm still waiting to see on if anything changes with their international travel ban, but if not I'm going to start applying for an exemption in February. ",solotravel,mrworldwidesupersize
Getting COVID in a foreign country while traveling,"Question for those still solo traveling during the pandemic.

Has anyone gotten COVID while in a foreign country? I don’t plan to travel until the vaccine, but I’m really curious how people are handling this.

Obviously it would be very unethical to move about  once you have symptoms, so what do you do? 

Cancel all forward (or return) travel until you clear a PCR 2-3 weeks later? Tell the hotel you are sick and can’t leave if you are supposed to check out?

If you are hostel bound, I wonder if they would just kick you out. Where do you go from there?! Seems inappropriate to check in to a new hotel or AirBnb once you are sick. 
And, depending on the country, how do you get food in a safe manner? It all seems quite risky, especially if you don’t speak the language.

Some background, Im super paranoid. im from the US and have been doing solo traveling for the past 2 years. I always stay at hotels. Even in the hotel i use my safe. I even put money in my shoes when i go out in case i get robbed. A hotel to me has always been part of the experience. At the beach or at the nightlife area. But maybe I'm wrong?

In the day i like to go hiking, swimming, ziplines, atv etc. At night restauatantes with local food and bars.

How many of you have visited Bucharest or Varna? How many days do you think I should spend in both Bucharest in Varna? Should I also check out Constanta, Romania which is on the Black Sea? Should I check out Sofia, Bulgaria as well? How do I travel between Romania and Bulgaria? Is FlixBus an option in Eastern Europe? Or should I use Union Ivkoni? Has anybody used Union Ivkoni before and how reliable are they? Furthermore, what kind of budget do you recommend for Romania and Bulgaria?

"18 y/o, First Time Solo Travel to Latin America, Advice Needed","Hi guys,
Assuming coronavirus is sufficiently contained by 2021 summer*, I was hoping to go solo travelling. I am European and will have finished my final exams. Usually people after these exams go travelling with friends around Europe, however, I wanted to do something different. It's not that I have no friends to travel with, more that the last few years and my childhood in general have been difficult, and I feel like I am starting a new chapter in my life. As cheesy as it sounds, I am dying for some alone time somewhere foreign, where I can engage my love of travel and learning, as well as taking time for introspection and learning more about myself. I would aim to spend about one month or one month and a half travelling - much more than I could in Europe, given that Latin America is cheaper from what I understand.

Latin America has always fascinated me, which is why I really want to visit. Not only the culture, but also its history and its current interesting socio-economic situation, with countries like Mexico and Brazil straddling middle-income status, next to more developed nations like Chile and Uruguay. I am fairly fluent in Spanish (approx. C1 level), and am learning Portuguese.

I should mention right off the bat that I'm a city guy: I like buildings, I like museums, architecture, learning about the history and socio-economic and political situation of different places around the world. That said, I can and do appreciate nature when I get the chance; I'm just not the type to go hiking and trekking, more the type to sit and admire the scenery.
With that all said, I have a few questions:

What is the ideal itinerary? I had a few different ones in mind:
(-&gt; is by bus, =&gt; is by air)

Belo Horizonte -&gt; Sao Paulo -&gt; Curitiba -&gt; Iguazu Falls -&gt; Buenos Aires -&gt; Santiago =&gt; Lima &amp; Cusco OR Bogota

or

Buenos Aires =&gt; Ushuaia =&gt; Buenos Aires -&gt; Mendoza -&gt; Santiago =&gt; Lima, Cusco OR Bogota

or some combination of the two. 

Other cities of interest are Florianopolis, Porto Alegre and Asunción. Nothing is concrete yet, I'm really just playing around with ideas right now. From what I understand, many of the nature parks in South Brazil aren't accessible by public transport, which is why I haven't considered them.

2) As a first time (male) solo-traveler, is visiting Latin America - Brazil in particular - a good idea?
I am well aware that there are crime problems in Brazil. Although most of the dangerous cities appear to be in the North East, where I don't plan on going, I have still heard bad things about Sao Paulo, and even worse things about Rio, which is why I haven't even considered Rio for travel at all, and am cautious about considering Porto Alegre (please do tell me if this is silly or not). I have never had a gun pulled on me, or been the victim of violent crime; the only ""robbery"" I have experienced are street muggings by unarmed people when I was younger.

However, I should also mention that my family is of Indian origin; my family in India, who I regularly visit, live in a fairly poor/deprived part of Delhi, so I'm not unfamiliar with the discomforts of travelling in less developed regions. I have visited Chicago, Washington D.C., and the outskirts of Detroit, if that makes a difference.

I am also fortunate enough to be fairly well travelled with my family; we tend to do budget city breaks when we travel in Europe, which entails using lots of public transit, and sometimes staying in slightly shadier parts of town. Again, I am aware European ""danger"" is nothing relative to Brazil.

With all this mind, am I too ""inexperienced"" to go to Brazil (and/or Colombia)? What about Buenos Aires, Patagonia and Santiago?

Thanks for reading this far and for any help! And I'll repeat this is all very very speculative at the moment and something I am only just considering as a possibility, so if this is a crazy/dumb idea do say so!

*I am aware that this is very hopeful thinking, which is why I am not taking this plan overly seriously: I am not booking anything anytime soon. If it is not safe enough to travel in 2021 summer, I would still like to do this trip the following year, so any advice is still appreciated!",solotravel,adventurer8602

How to financially sustain yourself during long term traveling?,"I went on a date a few months ago with someone who had spent 3 years of his life just freely traveling the entire world. It's something I've always dreamed of doing and I want to get plans underway, but something I didn't get to ask him (and can't now because he ghosted me) was, how does one sustain themselves financially while traveling for 3 years? My best guess would be he must've picked up odd jobs along the way, but I don't even know how one goes about finding odd jobs to pick up. Do you just ask around? How do you distinguish a financial opportunity from a labor trafficking trap? Hopefully this doesn't sound too naïve, I genuinely want to learn how this works and have nobody in my life to ask. For context, I'm female, American, in my mid-20's, white, and have very limited language expertise (but am working on learning secondary languages).

"19F Solo trip to Colombia, should I skip Bogotá?","Hi. Sorry if I formatted this wrong, I do not use reddit much.

I am 19F here and planning my first solo international trip to Colombia in 2021 (if covid allows). I am student with over $6000 USD in savings that I want to travel with and since school is online, I can study anywhere I want and I feel like this is best time in my life to travel because of that despite my family telling me I will make it back in a body bag. So, I was planning on spending most of my time,2-3 weeks in Cartagena since I enjoy the beach more than anything. But I have heard Santa Marta is better so that is not set in stone. I also am planning at least 5 days in Medellin and same with Cali. I have heard some bad stories about Bogotá and am wondering if it worth planning some days there??? 

I am planning on using air bnbs. I know a lot of solo travelers use hostels but I like my privacy. I am not looking to party much. I do not know much Spanish though, I have been studying on and off for about a year along with some classes at my college but would only consider myself to be conversational. 

My questions:
- Is Bogotá worth spending a few nights in?
- Is Colombia relatively safe for young solo female? I am not sure how well I will blend in as I am a tall pale redhead. But I know not to go out at night, hide my valuables, same precautions I take in any big city alone. 
- Is there any must see attractions in Colombia?
- It looks like you can take overnight buses in between the bigger cities but it is just better to pay for a flight in between??

Travelling from Canada to Barcelona for Medical Reasons,"Hello,

I am planning visit Barcelona to obtain medical imaging this January. I have been in contract with a neurosurgeon's office who informed me that I am able to skip quarantining upon arrival as the trip is for a medical appointment.

However, I was reading into the Government of Canada website that details the travel restrictions that says the following ""Travelers arriving from Canada are not allowed entry to Spain. However, certain travelers may be allowed entry if they can prove the essential nature of their travel or if they meet specific criteria.""

However the link to the specific criteria doesn't details what falls under ""essential nature"". I was wondering if the trip is for medical reasons and I have documentation showing I am going to visit a neurosurgeon would I be allowed entry to Barcelona.

Additionally, as I am 21 and unfamiliar with international travel and Barcelona I was wondering if I would additionally be allowed to bring a friend to accompany me on my trip.

List of questions:

1) What are the procedures before I travel to Spain

2) Would I be allowed entry for medical purposes

3) Can I bring a friend to accompany me, and would he or she also be allowed to skip quarantine

Spanish Immersion Program + hiking trails,"TL;DR: Planning to travel in June'21 or when the world opens up. Looking for a place where I can learn Spanish and have easy access to trail running and hiking.

Hello all, I've saved enough to take a 6-8 month break from work and not be worried about it. I was planning to travel in June or whenever the world is safe for travel again (whatever comes later). I don't need to hit up too many places but am content with staying longer in a few locations, focusing on my well being and getting immersed in the local culture.

Three things I did want to do are:

1. Learn Spanish (current proficiency: Basic)
2. Photography (current proficiency: Intermediate)
3. Hiking and trail running (current proficiency: Intermediate +)

I wanted your advice/experience on places where I could be part of some Spanish immersion program and have easy and safe access to some great outdoors. (Safe =  where I could hit the trails almost every day without worrying about having a guide or a group accompany me)

Below are a few places I've been to before and would love to return and stay longer, but unsure of the Spanish programs there. Would love feedback on them or any other similar places you'd recommend:

* Peru: Huaraz or Cusco (loved Huaraz!)
* Argentina: Bariloche (though it'll be winter in June/July)
* Spain: San Sebastian (passed through it on a hike and loved the town) or Mallorca
* Guatemala: Antigua or Lake Atitlan (loved it but was always told not to venture far without company)

whereas the [Slovenian government website](https://www.gov.si/en/topics/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/border-crossing/) has nothing that explicitly forbids US citizens from entering and only has requirements on quarantines and COVID testing for countries on the red list (Serbia included)

Backpacking USA - what does US border control ask when arriving?,"This is a trip planned after COVID is over. I'm just wondering how many plans I need to have. Currently I'm planning a three month-stay, arriving in NYC (with a return ticket from same airport) to spend some days and then take it from there, book buses, rest of the accommodation as the trip progresses etc. Will this be deemed suspicious?

Hopefully if everything goes ok next year I'm going to be traveling the world solo for a year. I was looking to purchase a camera for good quality pictures instead of using my phone.

Any recommendations?

Should I check in a luggage for my backpacking trip? Is it possible to travel with a 8 kg backpack for my whole trip?,"I plan on doing a backpacking trip across Turkey and potentially parts of the Soviet Union this May. 

My itinerary is

1. Fly from US to Turkey via Paris on Air France. Free 23 kg check in baggage
2. Travel around Turkey using Turkish Airlines, trains, busses, or Skyexpress airlines. All airlines allow free check in baggage 
3. (If all countries lift Covid rules by then): Public transport or Train from Turkey to Georgia. Then Georgia onto Yerevan, Armenia. I will skip this section if countries still have covid rules.
4. Fly from either Turkey or Armenia to Kyiv, Ukraine. Airline will be either Ukraine International or Skyup. 23kg checked baggage will cost $15-$25
5. If the EU allows US travelers by then. Fly from Kyiv to Warsaw Poland on Skyup. Checking in will cost $13 (which is 50% of the cost of the flight). Then fly from Warsaw to Chicago on Tap Portugal. This will cost me an extra $50 vs purchasing the Tap Discount fare. 

So basically, I will be paying an extra $80 ish to bring in a checked in suitcase on board all my flights. I'm just not sure if I can bring 3-4 weeks worth of stuff in a backpack. 

Also, currently all I have are ""school backpacks"". Any particular bags you recommend?",solotravel,Ukrainepolandborder

Would you rather travel younger with less money or wait and save?,"I always dreamed to be a long-term traveler but it's taking me forever to pay off my student loans. I'm living in a crappy suburban city saving money to quit my job in the next 1-3yrs but I have two options:

\- Quit in 3 yrs (at 33, going on 34) with $150k in the bank

The idea I'm kicking around is

* Book 3-5 week trip
* Go to place and work from there one-two weeks, enjoy food and nightlife in the mean time
* Go on adventures in that place for the rest of the time.

And the countries I'm kicking around are

* Argentina (BA, Patagonia)
* Chile
* Costa Rica
* Mexico (CDMX, Yucatan)
* Colombia
* Peru

Things I like:

* Trying food I could never find anywhere else
* Mind-bogglingly beautiful vistas and hiking
* Getting a feel for a city
* Coffee
* Beaches, Volcanoes

Crazy hostel experiences,"So, I'm not solo travelling (I'm backpacking with my boyfriend) but I thought this would be the best place to share my crazy experience. 

Moved into a hostel about 2 days ago, due to start working for accommodation on Saturday for hostel, so currently still paying. The room i've moved into is next to a noisy room, where people want to stay up late, have their friends in the room til late playing music, banging door to get in. It's annoying.

So after the second night of this happening, wakes me up at 1:30am (i've got work all day for a client so not good) - I knock the door ask them to turn music down, ignored. Knock again, finally stops. 

The next morning, I realise the noisy person is also the night manager and the cleaner, who angrily barks at people who don't clean up after themselves. So instead of going straight to reception to complain, I decide to speak with my new colleague now she is sober, and it's morning to ask her to go downstairs next time she hosts a party because we're neighbours. She goes crazy. Mental. Before I know it, she's cornering me in the bathroom threatening to punch me in the face. I can't move, she's actually physically blocked me with the steam cleaner. I keep my cool, stand my ground, until a girl brushing her teeth breaks it up. But she's not finished with me, she returns seconds later, telling me how she's going to shove my head in the toilet. At this point - I go to the manager, who is already coming out to see what the racket is all about. But the girls following me down the corridor, telling me about how she can't wait to put my head in shit. 

An hour later, she is removed from the hostel and ever since she has been wandering the street, walking around the block for a good solid 6 hours.

Pre travel anxiety,"I am 20 yo and for the last 5 years I've had crazy pre-travel anxiety and I really need some help because all the posts I have seen it is almost always about things you can write down and get over with. Every time I have to travel, even if I have done the same trip, even if the trip is short like 3-4 hours and not only by plane but by train or ship or car, I get a tremendous amount of anxiety to the point I consider canceling the whole trip. For example I have to travel today by train (4 hour trip) to get to my home city for Christmas and even though I have done this trip many times, I still feel very anxious before the trip. These past years I have been basically living with it and not really caring about it, I just know I am going to get anxiety and I just try to go with it and feel bad for the rest of the trip. I have gotten to the point where I vomit because of my anxiety especially when it is at its peak, minutes before the trip begins, ruining my day both emotionally and physically. Also I have to say that I really like traveling and visiting new or old places and different countries but I have to deal with this anxiety. What I mostly feel is stomach ache, nausea, short breathing, dry mouth. Generally sick. Also I know for a fact that I am not afraid of flights, money problems if I lose a connection or anything like that. It just happens when I have to travel. The rest of the time I am very healthy and energetic. I would really like to know if anyone else has this and if they have found a way to cope with it.",solotravel,TheLuckyKoin

"Trip Report: Russian Federation, September / October 2020","Hey brothers and sisters!

After making a lot of research I took the chance and visited Russia for 30 days in September and October 2020. Russia was always a dream destination for me and I was happy that I could still pull it off this year, despite all the obstacles that Corona put upon us.

**Disclaimer:** I am aware that I visited Russia as a foreign citizen for recreational, touristic purposes during a global pandemic. I hereby declare that everyone willing to travel should do his/her careful research about travelling in this era and what the the possible consequences of such a trip are. I therefore am not endorsing nor discouraging anyone from doing a trip nowadays - I'm just saying that you should do your careful research first.

**Background:** 29M Swiss, mostly have adventurous backpacking experience in Asia. Very interested in Russian / former Soviet culture and history. I can read Cyrillic and have some very basic Duolingo Russian skills, but apart from that I can't understand sh** and are pretty bad at everything. The trip took place between September and October 2020, right before the Corona numbers again went off the roof. 

**Budget:** About USD 50 per day, not including airfare or visa fees etc. Because of the current global situation the highest expenditure was the flight Zurich-Moscow and back, which only operated twice a week. But because my flight options were pretty limited I swallowed this bitter pill and did it.

**Length of Travel:** 30 days

**Destinations (not including daytrips):** Saint Petersburg, Petrozavodsk, Moscow, Volgograd, Simferopol, Sevastopol, Yalta, Vladikavkaz, Grozny, Erzi (Southern Ingushetia)

**Accommodations:** Either cheap hotels (found via HotelsCombined or Agoda) or at friends' or at guides' homes.

**Arrival:** The Corona pandemic makes planning an international trip obviously much more difficult than normally. While getting the 30 days visa was not a problem (only citizens from Switzerland, UK or Turkey could obtain tourist visas at that time), I also had to get a negative PCR test result 72 hours prior to my flight (in English or Russian language). This already set me back quite some money and time. At the airport in Switzerland my test result was checked very carefully by the departure staff and arriving in Moscow Domodedovo the Russian officials again checked the result along with my current body temperature. The procedures at immigration and security didn't take too long though (about 1.5 hours) since there were almost no travelling tourists but only returning Russian citizens. Many people were quite amazed to see a foreigner traveling at that time. Immediately after getting my backpack from the baggage claim I headed to the domestic check-in counters and took a domestic flight to Saint Petersburg, which also worked flawlessly.

**Activities:**

* Visiting the many landmarks in Saint Petersburg, such as Peter &amp; Paul, Artillery Museum, Peterhof or Kronstadt
* Visiting Kizhi Island and renting a car to visit other landmarks in Karelia (such as Ruskeala)
* Visiting Moscow and its many landmarks, such as Red Square, Kremlin, Bunker 42, Federation Tower or Monino Aircraft Museum
* Visiting Suzdal (Golden Ring) and its many churches and monasteries
* Visiting Volgograd and its landmarks such as Rossoshka Cemetary, Square of the Fallen Fighters, the war museums, Mamayev Kurgan
* Visiting the Southern part of Crimea, such as Simferopol, Sevastopol, Yalta and Bakhchysarai. Lots of daytrips such as to Artillery Bay, Crimean War panorama, Chersonesus ruins, Maxim Gorky fortress, Submarine base in Balaclava, Cape Fiolent, Ai Petri or Chufut-Khale
* Vladikavkaz, Karmadon Gorge and the Necropolis in Darvgas
* Grozny and a wonderful trek in Galanchezh region of Chechnya
* Southern Ingushetia including treks to Table Mountain and Erzi National Reserve

**What Went Right:** Pretty much everything major - despite the limitations by Corona everything in general went smooth without any incidents. Most landmarks and transporation options worked flawlessly.

**What Went Wrong:** Some few landmarks like Ostankino Tower in Moscow were closed without a comment due to the Corona measures and sadly couldn't be visited. Also many Western bank cards, credit cards and SIM cards won't work in Crimea due to Western sanctions, meaning you need to have some backup. Also because of annoying Corona measures I lost one day of travel between North Ossetia and Chechnya (which is a long story though).

**Recommendations:** GO TO RUSSIA (especially when the whole Corona circus is over).

**Final Verdict:** While maybe not as super adventurous and wild as South East Asia or the Middle East, Russia is a phenomenal mix of European and Oriental influences with extremely many facettes. Compared with other regions in the world it's also a safe and stable destination for a backpacking trip. Locals are lovely and hospitable people, especially in the countryside and in the south. The country simply has everything to offer for every taste, and even within 30 days you can only explore a fraction of the whole picture. While it was not my absolute favorite solo backpacking experience (that would rather be Iran or Vietnam) Russia is still very high in my personal list and I recommend anyone to visit it when things calm down again.

The bitter sting of failed travel romance,"I met this guy (currently travelling in Latin America)... we spent almost a week together whilst staying in the same hostel, kept in touch almost daily for a week afterwards and then tried to get things back on track when we met again in another city, though within a week it had collapsed. I won’t go into detail other than saying it failed because he was a lot less emotionally mature than I was, and I ignored a lot of red flags because our attraction was so intense.

3 weeks to be connected to someone whilst travelling felt like such long time... we were super into each other and even spoke about having feelings for each other and he even alluded to us having future on several occasions. 

 we ended it 3 weeks in and it hurt both of us. We carried on staying in the same town for 2 weeks afterwards and had some miserable and heated run ins. He finally left yesterday and wouldn’t even say goodbye to me. 

It’s a good thing he’s gone but equally It really hurts and I feel quite empty.

Has anybody else experienced similar? I swear it’s those “almost” situationships that hurt the most, and leave you feeling so stupid for getting so carried away in such a short space of time.

When would you feel confident enough to travel internationally again?,"Sorry if this is a repeat post or anything. Curious how other solo travelers are thinking about this.

Would you do anything differently post-pandemic? This is independent of destination, just when you personally would realistically book a trip internationally. Obviously, there has been news around the vaccine, but I think the unique risks of traveling alone make it something to be wary about and you can't be too safe right now.

"As an American, I'm really nervous about being able to go on a good solo trip again before starting a career.","I know I'm not original in my sentiments here.

I had just discovered how much I love international solo travel earlier this year before the pandemic spread far and wide. I was going to make plans to travel more over the summer before going back to school. It would have been perfect, because I wanted to go backpacking once more before getting immersed in my career. Obviously, we've all had to make some sacrifices.

I am going back to school for computer science, and as much as I love it, I'm concerned that I shouldn't make the commitment yet. In the US as far as I'm concerned, it's standard to only get two weeks of vacation time a year. Seeing as how I am not expecting to travel any time soon, even with the vaccine being deployed, I'm so scared! Especially because if I don't get an internship this next summer, I'll have to get one the next. And then I should be ready to graduate, and a gap on my resume would look bad, I think.

I would love to become a digital nomad, but I don't know how realistic that is, especially since I haven't really honed my CS skills yet. I would also really love to move to another country, but I know how hard that is to do, too. Especially since English is my only language.

Any thoughts, advice, or similar feelings? Sorry if I sound whiney! Traveling and experiencing new places/ cultures is really what makes me feel happier to be alive. These past few months have been hard with nothing to look forward to.

Tips to meet people while solo traveling (even if you're awkward af like me),"I commented on someone's post about this but figured I'd make a whole post. I'm a huge fan of making friends while traveling and still keep in touch with random one-off friends I made in weird places. I think it's a special bond. Here are some ways I break the ice. 

**Note:** I've been on both sides of this as the lone traveler who has met and made friends with other solo travelers and groups, as well as the person in a group who has absorbed an orphan traveler into our group for the day/week. 

**These have worked for me:**

* **Wear or carry something distinctive, something that relates to your hobbies or passions.** I put stickers on literally everything and all my stickers relate to my hobbies/interests/bands/shows/books. So many people will stop and be like ""ahh, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sticker!"" or ""The Office!"" (even though everyone loves The Office, doesn't matter). Talking about *something* leads to talking about anything. More people than you realize want to make friends, they just feel weird as hell like you do. I live in Alaska so if I put something that says Alaska on it, people will inevitably comment on it **but** be wary of geographically identifiable clothing as it can make you a target as a tourist in less safe places.
* **Just ask people why they're traveling and where they're from.** Everyone thinks they're a grand explorer when they leave home and they're dying to talk about it.
* **Be interested in listening, don't feel pressured to talk.** Being interested is way more effective in making connections than being *interesting,* as people are more likely to want to hear your stories if they feel bonded to you and not like you're some weird stranger, vomiting your story all over them. So ask questions and actually listen, listening is super rare and always extremely appreciated.
* **Act open and excited, people are drawn to that shit.** Don't be weird, but don't be jaded. Sometimes anxiety can manifest as someone looking bored/disinterested, but nobody wants to have to pry someone out of their shell to get to know them. Be mindful of your paralanguage (non-verbals) and how closed-off you seem.
* **Practice trying new social techniques.** If you fuck it up and make it weird, you will literally never see them again and nothing matters. I've done some insanely awkward shit in the name of travel and while I didn't always make a lifelong friend, I definitely have some interesting stories.
* **Be open to new things.** Just because something doesn't sound fun, doesn't mean it can't lead to something fun. Sometimes I think we travel to distant lands just to do the same shit we do back home. Challenge yourself. Your routine will always be waiting for you back home. For example, I went motorbiking in Bermuda for the first time, it was scary as hell and my new friend broke her ankle and I accidently drove into a prison complex but did I have fun? Fuck yeah.
* **Don't wait for others to do a cool thing.** Do that cool thing and you will invariably find people there who do cool things. Your friends don't want to go to an Irish pub in motherfucking Ireland? Well guess what that pub is full of? People who want to be in Irish pubs. 
* **Take an active interest in the local culture.** Locals love sharing the regional drama, love being experts in their country, and delight in foreigners who aren't just there to see That One Tourist Destination. Most of them will complain about tourists, and that's half the fun. Like I said, in Alaska we joke about Tourist Hunting Season and complain about how our downtowns are flooded with outsiders every summer, but given the chance we will regale you with our crazy outdoor adventures and brag about how our cousin's ex-boyfriend was a crab fisher on season 3 of That Crab Fishing Show Whose Name I Can't Remember.
* **Don't be sloppy.** Nobody wants to hang out a second time with the dumpster person who got blackout and stuck their group with their tab.
* **Go on dates!** (if you're single, obvs) I've met some cool-ass people while traveling and swiping. As long as you're up front about your boundaries and what you're looking for, lots of locals are down for a one-off date and they probably know the ""cool local spot"" that they're excited to show you. I got roasted by Judah Friedlander at a comedy show on a date in NYC once. Probably wouldn't have known about it if my dated hadn't told me about that comedy show. 
* **Lastly, don't get stuck in your demographic.** Some of the coolest people I've met while traveling were way older. For example, when I was 26 I did shots in Iceland with a 65-year-old travel agent while her husband cheered us on and she still sends me periodic updates about her grandkids. Old people are cool as hell, hang out with them.

why don't people try to fight back muggers in colombia?,"from what i understand, going to medellin or bogota is completely law less. it doesn't really matter how ""careful"" you are. if someone so much as sees that you have an iphone, you're basically guaranteed to encounter a mugger, from what i understand. it's ashame, can't even check your phone or the time because you want to avoid giving away you have ""value"" and instantly being marked as a target by potential on lookers

my question is, why don't people fight back? for example, if you know someone is likely to mug you just for walking down the street, why not prepare for it. i've read people get mugged so easily there. just walking in broad daylight around some people, then 2 guys approach you and pull out a knife, demand your phone, and then run off. and everyone around you just continues on with their day as if nothing happened, cause it's just so normal for that to happen

how about having some mace on hand, so that when you are approached and see the knife, you basically mace the guy in the face, give one swift kick to the balls, then just be on your merry way. it's not like others will stop you from doing this, or you will be caught by cops?",solotravel,itcantbestopped11
Kindness to a Weary Moroccan Traveler,"I love travelling. I've been solo traveling since I was in my twenties and actually prefer it because of the adventures I've had, though I look forward to including my partner one of these days. I'm really bummed right now, though about how unsafe and difficult it is to go anywhere, so I've been thinking about stories from the past. I wanted to share the experience that convinced me to keep solo traveling.

In 2007, I was a university student during a year abroad in Canterbury, England. On the advice of some people who had been in my program the year before, I decided not to go home, back to the states, for Christmas, but instead stay there and use the time for traveling. While most of my friends were going to Amsterdam for the legal pot, I had my heart set on going to Morocco because I wanted to experience Northern Africa, the first time I would be in a country where I was not the dominant race. I figured that it would be perfect to spend Christmas there since, as a predominantly Muslim country, I figured most business would be open through the season.

So, once classes were out for the winter break, I took a Ryanair flight over to Barcelona and spent a week in Spain before hoping on a bus from Madrid to the port city of Algeciras to catch the ferry over to Tangier.

Now about all that went as expected was I found where to purchase the tickets for my ferry and went over to the waiting area. I wasn't sure when the ferry would take off, but I figured it had to be soon. So I waited. And waited, And waited some more. I was there hours before it was time, evening slipped into night, and the waiting area was quickly filling up. I sat there until the wee hours of the morning, unsure when I was finally going to get to go but not terribly worried since I had no firm plans. Finally they started loading the boat, and I found myself on a cramped ferry and could only plop down on the floor in an empty space. I had no idea why so many people seemed to be trying to get to Morocco that night.

It was early the next morning, around 7:00 am by the time we got to Tangier. I was hungry and exhausted and really wanted to find a place to get some rest before continuing on down the coast the next day. As I was disembarking from the ferry, though, I was pulled aside, along with a few other people and had to wait for a rather gruff and unhappy looking customs officer to come talk to me. It turns out that the way customs works on this particular ferry is you get your passport stamped on the boat and then just show your passport as you disembark. There had been announcements but, because they were all in Spanish and Arabic, I didn't understand them. I was horrified and scared he was going to send me back to Spain but, after some questioning, he took out a stamp, stamped my passport, and sent me on my way.

I immediately realized something was up when I saw people literally on the street corners cooking goats. I would come to find out that, yes, I had escaped the Christian holidays in Britain, but my uncultured self forgot to check the Muslim calendar. I had arrived on Eid al-Adha, one of the holiest days on the Muslim calendar, and I was witnessing people out celebrating and preparing their feast. That's why there were so many people on my ferry. I started to panic: I knew I would be lucky that day to find a meal, much less lodging, that day.

I had picked out a pension, a small, cheap hotel, to stay in for the night, and found a taxi driver, who had no idea where it was. After driving around in circles, I asked him to drop me back off at the port, and then I realized the pension was only a block from the port on a pedestrian street. I walked up to the pension and stood at the front desk, exhausted, hungry, and more than a bit weary from the last twenty-four hours.

The owner of the pension walked up to the desk, a little surprised to see a customer at this time of the morning. I asked him if he had any rooms. Yes, he told me he did. I felt elated. For the first time this trip, something was going right.

""But I will not check you in!"" he told me. I looked at him, baffled. What was going on? Had I already offended him? Did I break some taboo without even knowing?

Sensing my confusion, he repeated, ""I will not check you in!"" He paused, looked at my face, and smiled. ""It is a holy day! I will not check you in until you have tea with me!""

It took me a moment to process what he'd just said. This man, who didn't know me, who had just met me, was asking me to have tea with him in honor of the Eid. I'd like to think he saw in my face a weary soul, way out of my element, and wanted to show me some kindness.

I did sit with him and with an Indian man I would find out was a regular at the pension. We talked about life. I told them my story as we had Moroccan mint tea with some bread and honey. I told them my story (the Indian man was briefly confused when I said I was from Indiana) and they told me theirs. We learned about one another that day. I also expressed my fear of not being able to find food on the Eid, and the owner reassured me.

""You are staying in my pension. You will eat tonight!""

I was overwhelmed by his generosity and, just before midday, crawled into a bed on the second floor, sleeping sounder than I had in ages.

That man is why I keep travelling. Travelling keeps reaffirming my belief that most people are basically good and want to be good people. His hospitality to a complete stranger who would have stayed at his pension even without it was so touching. I have since encountered generous, kind people in so many countries on multiple continents. The pension owner taught me that, even in a new country where I don't know the language or customs or traditions, even after a long, stressful day, there were people who could touch you and lift your spirits with a simple act of kindness.

I hope I'm half as good a person as that man.",solotravel,queerly_radical

Does anyone else not meet people when they travel?,"I read a lot of stories and threads in this sub that are detailing the amazing experiences that people have meeting other people, sex, travel romance and to me I can’t relate to any of that because I never meet anyone when I travel. Does anyone else not meet people? 

I still have fun but all my experiences are solo experiences I’ve not had a shared experience before which goes against what this sub usually experiences. 

People say they meet other people on walking tours; I’ve never been on a walking tour that didn’t just end at the finish and when we tip the tour guide people just went off and do their own thing. The last two walking tours I went to the majority of people there clearly knew each other and stuck with each other. 

Saying hello to people never seems to go past an introductory phase or the usual ‘where are you from’

I’ve been on tours and not met anyone. I went on a full day tour that involved boating and everyone there clearly knew each other and had formed their own groups and were talking together in their own languages so I ended up spending the day by myself getting the cuntest sunburn of all time. 

The most awkward tour was when it was me and these two women who knew each other, there was a 4th person but he cracked the shits about something and went off raging in to the sunrise and after trying to strike a conversation with the others and getting nowhere I just left it

In hostels I’ve not met anyone either. I usually go out during the day, come back for a snooze in the afternoon then go out for dinner and drinks in the evening and maybe it’s just bad timing but most of the hostels were either empty in the common area at the time or people were with their friends or doing some undisturbed so I usually do my thing alone. I go to bars alone and don’t meet locals but I usually don’t speak the language well enough. 

There was one hostel where there was a group dinner advertised so I went there, sat down, started saying hello and what not and the entire table was speaking French - I was neither in France nor am I French so I just left. 

On the days where I’ve not wanted to do much I noticed most people did the same thing I did going out during the day and night so the hostels were mostly empty and there wasn’t a “hey we both got nothing to do let’s go do something” person around. 

Maybe it’s just me doing something wrong I don’t know but my experience of travelling seems to be the complete opposite of the stories people post in here. Surely someone else has the same experience when they travel? I don’t find it to be the super social experience people say it is but maybe that’s because I won’t disturb a group if they know each other or speaking other languages to each other which I’d consider rude. 

I’ll usually try and say hello how are ya etc like when I was at hostel and got dinner I sat outside on the table and a group was already there but it didn’t go further than that. For whatever reason people don’t seem receptive to me and timing also doesn’t seem to align when meeting people so I usually just end up going to bars by myself, get hammered and find my way home some how.

It doesn’t really bother me too much since I don’t have any friends where I live so it’s no different and I’m used to isolation but I guess I had that expectation that travelling and doing things like tours and staying hostels gets people together when it doesn’t end that it doesn’t matter where I am in the world I’m still the same loser there as I am here",solotravel,PMmeYOURBOOBSandASS
Best/safest places to visit as a solo female?,"Hello! I am 24 years old (from Illinois, USA) and have traveled various places throughout my life with my family/friends but as soon as the travel restrictions start lifting and COVID is better I would like to do a solo trip somewhere! I have to admit that I’m nervous to travel alone as a female so I was wondering if anyone has any experiences/advice to share with me? Also, are there any places in the world where solo travelers (of all genders) feel safest? Anything helps! Thank you!

Edit: I’m sorry if I offended anyone not from the US! I was not trying to insinuate that America is the safest place I know we have our problems and a lot of troublesome and dangerous places here and I am careful to avoid these places! I was more curious where else in the world I can travel to gain some new experiences that seem to be safer than other places! Thanks again for all of your advice and once again I’m sorry if I offended anyone 😊",solotravel,APad24
Am I the only one who does this?,"I’m female in my late 30’s. Looking back on my years of solo travel adventures, I seem to have constant affairs with hotel/hostel workers.
Here’s a few of them: 

Egypt: 26 year old hotel manager in Cairo. Was upset I was dating another Egyptian guy. Bought me gifts, took me out to restaurants and an amazing day trip to the Red Sea. Had sex in my room twice. (All with protection of course) 

Dubai: half Emirati half Yemeni guy working at the check in desk. We flirted. After 3 days, brought me dinner to my room. Had sex. 

India: 22 year old Rajasthani guy who worked hard to become manager of hostel. Would flirt and bring me chai to my room every morning. He jumped into bed with me. 

Nepal: 28 year old upper class Nepali guy who’s parents owned 3 hotels. Took me on his motor bike to the most amazing restaurants and temples. Had sex twice in my room. When I left he slept in my bed for a week without changing the sheets. 

Kuwait: Syrian guy. Flirted for a while. Came to my room to watch tv. Took of his pants and asked if I like what I saw. I did. 

Tunisia: a guy my age working at the front desk. Took me around Carthage, trendy bars and restaurants. We took a road trip Down to the Sahara desert for the weekend. 

Morocco: Moroccan hotel manager who took me to all the souls in Marrakech and shared my bed for 2 nights

Cancun: head chef at resort from Vera Cruz. Cooked me amazing food and would come to my room after dinner service with a bottle of champagne 

I had a great time with all of them, but surely I’m not the only girl they do this to. I’m sure they hit up every attractive girl that comes through the doors.

Favorite nonwestern countries for solo? (travel scholarship ideas),"Hi! What was your favorite nonwestern location you traveled to? What was your fav experience there?

I'm applying for a travel scholarship that sponsors you to solo travel around the world for half a year, but only to nonwestern areas (no europe or australia, etc). I KNOW I want to go, but the problem is that I've never left america and honestly, I don't know that much about other countries. My itinerary is gonna have 6+ countries from 2 major world regions and I will spend a lot of time in each. I have some places in mind, but I would love to learn about what other solo travelers say. 

My interests: relatively unseen locations, places that have cultural festivals or events that I can catch at a certain time of the year (like carnival or oktoberfest), places with cool nightlife, beautiful natural environments I can explore, places where its easy to meet people. Pretty much any and everything. I'm looking for a diverse array of experiences, the more foreign, the better. I hardly know what type of things are even out there.

When have you splurged way beyond your normal budget and was it worth it?,"I stayed for 80 euros for one night in a hotel in Northern Greece. Might not be huge bucks to some but considering I'm a life long backpacker who is normally slumming it in 5-12 euro dorms. 

It's because I was cycle touring and I ended up stranded in a small place with literally no other options. 

I mean, it was a nice place. Breakfast was amazing. Room was amazing. You can get very very nice hostels too with nice breakfasts but it did make me feel that for at least one day on every extended trip I should enjoy a taste of the (relative!) high life.  
Edit: One nice thing was that, because presumably they aren't used to cycle tourists in nice hotels and the hotel was quiet (low season) I got a bit of the old VIP treatment! A very exuberant Greek chef came out when I was having my breakfast with an extra dish or two saying things like ""this very special Greek pie - will give you lots of energy for your cycling!"" And then gave me a few chocolates to give me more energy for my journey. Especially welcome as that morning turned out to otherwise be a very rainy miserable morning of cycling. 


On the other hand, I paid similar for a premier inn some random ass town in Southern England when I missed my train and again had no options. And it was literally no nicer, if not less nice, than a good hostel.

That's hotels though - there's also tours; attraction fees; transport; meals; whole destinations like Bhutan, the high arctic, North Korea, Turkmenistan or Pacific islands generally (I've been to two from that list: Papua New Guinea and Svalbard and both were worth it). 

I feel this is relevant to solo travel as things like hotels are more expensive to us and we are much more likely to slum it in general, but interested in your takes.",solotravel,pooey_mcpooface
Which country/destination made you truly feel like the adventurers or explorers of the past ?,"Hey everyone how's it going ?


If it wasn't for a certain pandemic I would be eagerly awaiting my solo trip to Peru and Bolivia which isn't going to happen anytime soon so I thought might as well plan my future bucket lists when international travel is allowed again. 


Now I know in this day and age there really isn't any truly 'uncharted' territory left and everything has been discovered and if its worth doing I wont be the first one there nor will I be the last. I mean if you really wanted to you can even book a trip to both the North and South pole or even climb Mt Everest (for a heavy price). 

I've been to Nepal for EBC and Tanzania for Mt Kili and although they are both extremely popular tourist destinations far from being 'uncharted' or 'off the beaten path' they still gave me the feeling of being a 'adventurer' in a 'unknown world' 


So I'm pretty much after locations/destinations that gave you the feeling like you are in the unknown wilderness far from civilisation and completely untouched or forgotten by humanity. Essentially if the destination or journey made you feel like the explorers and adventures of old I definitely want to hear about it ! 


Thank you for your time and have a great day. Take care !",solotravel,Nugget93
Dolomites/swiss alps questions,"Hey y'all, I've been inspired by this subreddit to plan my first solo international trip for next summer and was wondering if anyone with experience in these places could help clarify a few specific things for me or at least point me in the right direction. 

My first question is that I plan to stay in a lot of rifugios/mountain huts in Italy and the swiss alps and I notice some websites say to ""bring your own sleeping bag""... Does that mean like an actual sleeping bag you'd bring camping/backpacking or something else? Because I also notice from pictures that the beds have a folded blanket on top of them. Also for rifugio locatelli's reservation page, it gives me the option of ""beds with bed linen (in 2,3,4 bed rooms) or mattress storage"" for accommodation type and I can't figure out what the difference is between those. It might be a weird English translation thing? 

My other question is regarding parking at tre cime to stay at that rifugio. In my current plan, I would arrive there by car in the afternoon, like around 2 or 3pm, but I've seen the internet say that the parking lot fills up by 10am. I assume people continually leave throughout the day so is it ACTUALLY possible that I could be blocked out from parking up there that day, even with an overnight reservation up there? 

Thanks! I'm from the US and my goal is to go end of august-early Sept if I'm vaccinated by then (probably)",solotravel,derpina321
What is the most unbelievable thing to happen to you while travelling solo?,"One of my favourite things about solo travel is the fact that it forces you to go outside your comfort zone. It's a lot easier to say yes to things you wouldn't usually do and this can result in the most insane/hilarious/scary/incredible things happening which are often some of the best memories of trips away. 

The one annoying thing I've found though, is when I get home and I'm telling people about my trip. I can sometimes tell that some of my friends think I'm bullshitting them with Walter Mitty-esque tales. It doesn't bother me too much but it's sometimes frustrating when I'm being honest but I don't have someone to corroborate my story. 

With that in mind, and with the promise that I'll believe your story no matter how insane it might sound, what is the most unbelievable event (or events) that has actually happened to you on your travels?

Who was the oddest person you ever met at a hostel?,"I don't necessarily mean it in a sinister way. Just like... the most odd/BIZARRE (not OLD 🙃). 

I was in one of the Budapest Party hostels about 5 years ago and one of the other solo travellers there was obsessed with chess. Would only talk about chess. Commandeered the hostel chess set and went from group to group trying to play it with every guest. Absolutely dominated all of them. After the win, he would move on without saying much. 

On my last day there, I was his lucky chosen one. We started playing. I'm shit at chess. He took my queen after 5 or so moves. 

At this point one of the staff announces that anyone coming on the hostel organised day trip has 10 minutes to meet at the reception before they head off. Mr Chess must have reserved a place on this trip because he was getting noticeably nervous and prompting me to hurry up everytime it was my turn. I was getting destroyed so I of course purposefully slowed down. 

The ten minutes passed and he had to leave. Our match was far from over and he was freaking out. He insisted that we took a picture of the board and continued where we left off when he returned. He then quickly shovelled all the chess pieces into the box and brought the chess set with him on the day trip. 

After they left, I packed my stuff and moved on to Croatia. 

I often think about him and wonder if I was the only person he didn't beat on his trip.

Traveling in Egypt for 2 weeks,"Hello , 

I am traveling in Egypt for last 2 weeks of December.  I am flying in to Cairo and flying out of Sharm. My plan in this trip is to start with Cairo , see the ruins and know the history. Make my way south to Luxor and then across east to Dahab. Probably make a stop in Sharm for a night or dive there.  This is my tentative plan but I am open to suggestion. 

I have been doing my research but I would like opinion from people who have traveled to Egypt or know the country the following things. 

* Guides - I feel guide is important as there is so much history related to this place. I am not sure who i can hire them for a day or two. Would like to get a reliable source. 
* Tips - Looks like Egypt has a tipping culture ( atleast on the tourist sites) , I saw on the video's that people would expect tips if they help you take pictures or in transportation. Is it a must to tip ? how much would you tip ? I have no problem tipping in restaurants or for a cab , but for a picture ? Please let me know. 
* Covid - What is covid situation is Egypt ? I do not see much info online. Not that I am going to cancel the trip now  but any information will be helpful 

Places visiting 

* Cairo 
* Luxor / Aswan (may be)
* Dahab

Travel 

I am planning to travel in bus/train in between the cities. Will be taking ferry to Sharm. Does any one know if they are on operation ? One of the video I checked said it only runs/floats , during the peak season. Apparently this is a peak season , but we are all aware of the condition now. 

Interest in Egypt

* Culture 
* History 
* Diving

Anybody else not care about being the stupid American?,"Rn I'm in north Africa and I do a lot of stereotypically American things. I feed the stray animals, I give beggars money, I talk to strangers and I'm very friendly with them. (I'm actually half north African so I'm sensitive to the culture and know it well.)

Sometimes it hurts my feelings when they don't know I understand the language (even if I can't speak it very well) and I hear them make fun of me or intentionally overcharge me but I don't care if they think I'm being stupid.

Going to Greece next November - Aegina vs. Mycenae?,"I'm (hopefully) going to Greece in November if the pandemic allows for it to happen by then. I only have three full days, not including the day I arrive and leave, and I'm going to be spending 2 of them in Athens. For the third day, I'd like to take a day trip, but I'm not sure where.

I love history and culture and those are my two main interests in traveling. Mycenae is obviously a great historical sight, but I'd like to soak in at least one island and explore the natural beauty of Greece, since I know that's a huge attraction that all my friends and family tell me I need to see before I leave the country. The problem with Aegina though is that I'm not sure how lively the islands are during November and whether most stores, restaurants and attractions will still be open during that time of the year. 

Alternatively, I could spend an extra day in Greece and try doing both, but then I'd have to subtract a day from my Istanbul plans (I'm currently planning on four full days in Istanbul after Greece. It would be three if I want to spend another day in Greece.) I just feel pretty overwhelmed because there are so many options at hand, lol.

Turkish E-visa question- Do I have to wait 180 days between each trip to apply for a new e-visa?,"I am a Bangladeshi national planning a trip to Turkey at some point next year when things get better.

I am wondering if I can stay in Turkey for 30 days, leave and go to Georgia/Egypt/Balkans and come back a month later with a new e-visa? Or will I not be allowed to reapply until the 180 day period for the original one isn't over. If the latter is the case, I would apply for my visa 4-5 months ahead of my trip and time my trip just right, so I can leave for a month, wait out the ending of the 180 day period and re-enter with a new e-visa application.

Solo Female trip to Nairobi in September,"  Hi Everyone, 

 Scott's Cheap Flights delivered once again! $650 USD tickets to Nairobi. Now this was pretty was spontaneous so I still have a lot of planning to do but you guys are really great with recommendations so I'll start here. Would love your recommendations, tips, tricks, must sees for Nairobi:

Interest: Mostly outdoor, camping, hiking, whitewater, beach, mountains, wildlife, art, Avant Gard, weird stuff, cooking

Length – Friday to following Saturday (9 days)

Budget – Would like to be as frugal as possible but willing to spend for the big experiences (treks, safari, flights, tours, etc). I anticipate either renting a car or hoping on a regional flight at some point for a few days outside of Nairobi. I can sleep anywhere that is safe and hope to camp at some point as well (either alone or with a tour). I prefer hostels over AirBnB or hotels if possible.

Other Considerations: I only speak English, I can read and understand French at a beginner level. I don’t know how to drive stick shift. I have experience travelling solo in Mexico, Slovenia, Barcelona, and USA. 

Questions on Car Rentals: Are there any surprises? Like in Mexico where the rental is $5 a day but the mandatory insurance is $500. 

Currency?: Should I expect local cash exchanges only or can I use my travel credit card?

Ideally, I imagine a few days in the capital and then the rest of the time travelling around Kenya via car, or possibly getting on a plan and travelling to somewhere else in the region. Flights to the continent of Africa are usually $1200+ in my area so I want to take advantage of the opportunity. 

 I know this is really BROAD, please don't bash me, yes I know Google exists. This sub has given me some of the best travel recommendations I've ever experienced so I wanted to start with the experts first! Thanks and much appreciated!",solotravel,lostkarma4anonymity

Travel Goals,"Hi everyone! I used to have grand plans (and still do to some extent) of traveling Europe or SEA or South America for months on end. However, I recently started a job that I really like and now I'm reduced to 1-2 weeks of travel per year.

I was having trouble deciding where to spend that time until I found The 7 Summits Challenge (climbing the tallest point on each of the 7 continents). I don't necessarily plan on climbing all 7 mountains but it really helped me narrow down the places I would like to visit and I really like the idea of having a list of attainable goals as opposed to the more vague idea of just traveling.

"Want to go see the world on my own, but I'm not sure if I was built too","Hey all, 20M here from the UK. For the longest time I've been fascinated with the countries of the world and the people and cultures in them. I really want to go start seeing them at some point, I have a super strong urge to just travel all over Europe this upcoming Spring (provided lockdown is over by then of course). However, I have some conditions that I think will make this quite hard. The big one is that I have a form of ASD and therefore can be prone to panic and being overwhelmed in unfamiliar environments. To add to this, I can sometimes have extreme difficulties in socialising because of it, although this has become much less of a problem in recent years. But a few years back when I was travelling in the UK on my own, I ended up having something of a total breakdown and have been put off going abroad ever since. Although I am still not sure what incited this breakdown since I was deeply depressed at the time but I'm now on medication which has made me much less prone to these incidents. 

I am not at all experienced with travelling abroad, with the exception of a few days in Paris on a high school trip over five years ago lol. Mainly because of the fear that my anxiety disorders and depression would just get the better of me for when I travel alone, as it has done domestically. I finish uni next Summer, having been locked on my own for nearly half of the three years I had spent there due to Covid and whatnot so I'm really eager to go explore when it is all over but I'm just not sure I have it in me to pull it off successfully. 

Has anyone else had similar experiences before they started solo travelling? I'm twenty now but I've never done anything exciting and I'm so desperate to change that for when I can travel again, make the most of living while I'm young, you know? Because at the moment I just want to live an exciting life but I am just worried that my disabilities and disorders may prevent me from experiencing that.

Cycletouring in the US?,"Hey guys.

So, due COVID cancellations I have a bunch of carrier flight points to use in the US and wanted to spend 1-2 months in the country. Never been to the US before and I am planning to rely on buses and my bike to travel around as much as I can.

Thing is, this would be my first international bike trip, and my first time in the US. I would land in JFK and cycle down Washington and then Virginia. Then rely on buses around Southern US (I plan to go to Texas visit a friend). My trip would end in Grand Canyon, then taking another transportation to get a flight back home from California.

I need to understand the logistics to carry the bike case and panniers, and also how much is feasible to travel around the country using my bike and buses. How much does it cost to carry this stuff in int. flights? Can I put my case in travel buses in the US? Also, is it dangerous to do solo cycletourism in the US?

I plan to do it once it's not too hot and I'm vaccinated, so perhaps during the Fall. Meaning I have a little less than a year to figure this all out and plan my trip.

Recommendations on where I should go! (first major solo travel ~ 3 weeks),"Hello, hope everyone is staying safe during these crazy times....
TL;DR

In my early/mid twenties from USA and will have about 3.5k to spend on a 3 week trip. Trying to decide between: South East Asia, Japan, or Europe 
Or if you have any other recs plz lmk!

Just a little background, I did my first ever backpacking trip with a friend from college in Europe for ~ 1 month. It was fantastic, but honestly my favorite part of the trip was when we split up for about a week (no drama or anything, he just went to see family) and i got to experience staying in a hostel by myself and planning all my own activities. I was so surprised at how easy it was to meet people and felt so free not having to plan around someone else!

That was about 1.5 years ago(summer 2019, I know, we got so lucky we got that trip in before all this happened) and honestly, ever since then I’ve been dreaming about my next trip (solo) and saving for it. So far I have about 2.5k saved for a trip and am planning to save another 1k in the coming year. So ~3.5k in total is my budget

After I get the vaccine and travel is back to normal I’m thinking I’m going to take 3 weeks off work either 4th quarter 2021 or early 2022.

Looking for recommendations on where I should go. I’ve heard South East Asia is really good for first time solo travelers and has an established backpacker infrastructure but the only place I’m really interested in so far would be Thailand. I imagine 3 weeks would be too much time in one country but lmk if you think otherwise or have any other recommendations in SEA.

I’ve also always been fascinated with Japan and really want to visit Tokyo/Osaka. However I know that not much English is spoken and I worry it would be a little too much for a first time solo trip. Also Japan will be there and maybe better for when I am older (in early/mid twenties rn)

And my last thought is to go back to Europe and go to some of the countries I skipped/really liked. Portugal and Spain. Or maybe go with the northern route. I did really like Europe!

I know this is pretty vague and I’m super fortunate to have still been employed and be able to save this amount for a trip. Any recommendations would be helpful on those 3 I talked about or honestly if you have an entirely different place I hadn’t thought about please do tell!!!
And do you think 3.5k is a good budget for 3 weeks? Or if that is that overkill, I could always spend less and save the rest for my next solo trip down the line.

Thanks In advance",solotravel,ReptillianRecords

What Are Some Easily Accessible (no car) but Beautiful Hiking Routes Throughout Europe?,"Hello, everyone! 
I'm a solo traveller (19F) intending on catching up on my travels in (mostly) Eastern Europe once us Canadians are all vaccinated and once we are advised that it is safe to travel internationally again. I think you all understand that now is the time to daydream and plan, while we are all stuck at home!
I'll have to go over the summer-time since I'm still a student and have May to August free. I am not old enough to rent a car, so I'll be flying and using trains and buses to get around. I love to day hike and am experienced and spry enough to attempt some fairly tough mountainous adventures. I won't have a tent or anything, since I'll be carrying all my supplies in a single carry-on bag, so overnight hikes are a no-go, especially since I'm a lone lady. 
Do you have any good and solo-safe recommendations for day hikes that I can walk, hike, bus, or train near to its trailhead? I'll be spending most of my time backpacking in Eastern Europe, but will be commencing my journey in the UK and France, and will continually keep my eyes open to cheap flights to Greece and surrounding islands, and also the Nordic countries. If there are any unmissable and easily accessible hiking spots that are safe for solo adventures and that are along common tourist routes, I would love to know! If any of the hikes are special in specific months, like some of the hikes in Norway with its Aurora Borealis season, that would also be great to know.

Can Workaway be immoral?," I'm very interested in using workaway but am worried about the potential immoral aspects of workaway or voluntourism in general, for example:

* Taking positions that could/should be done by paid locals
* Being unskilled, especially in construction, then creating more problems down the line
* Creating a dependency on foreign aid rather than improving the local community
* Short lived engagements with children creating separation anxiety for them

Do you think these are problems with workaway and if so how can you avoid perpetuating them when using workaway?

Best places in the US for solo women,"I realized I haven't traveled much domestically, so would love any suggestions for destinations and journeys in the US for a solo female traveler. Some considerations:

- I’ve lived in large East Coast cities (NYC/Boston/DC), and in general, would like to avoid spending too much time in very large cities like LA etc. I’m thinking more like smaller cities (e.g. New Orleans or Portland, ME) or non-cities.

- Length: 2-3 weeks.

- I'd love to see as much of the country I can by train, like how people buy an Interrail/Eurail pass to see Europe. I can’t drive, and while flying is an option, I’d ideally want scenic views during the journey.

- Budget: I’m unsure about this, so estimates would be helpful. I’ve saved up and was thinking around $4k, and while obviously the less the better, I’m willing to go up a bit if that seems unrealistic. I’m not seeking luxury, but want to be reasonably comfortable and safe.

- Interests: Food is super important, I don’t care where I get it from as long as it’s delicious; no dietary restrictions, and am very open to trying new foods. I also love to just walk around, surrounded by beautiful scenery or interesting architecture. Not as interested in museums or nightclubs.

- Safety: I’m a woman of color, so yeah, while I wish this were an irrelevant fact, anything that minimizes my risk of sexual assault/racism would be great.

Europe in Three weeks,"So I booked a Contiki for April this year, and low and behold COVID happens and everything gets cancelled 4 weeks before I'm supposed to travel. I've accepted that it was actually a great thing because I realized that the trip included places I didn't particularly want to see (because it was included in the overall trip), and I don't want to waste valuable time in a bus. So I am going at it alone, I'm planning to go to Paris, Italy (Florence, Rome, Venice), Berlin, Amsterdam and London.

Going to a new place and STILL having mutual connections?,"Wasn't sure how to title the post lol.

I come from a small town in the UK and went to university in a very small city where everyone knew each other.

After uni ended, I went to New York by myself on a solo trip and made some friends.

Now today, randomly I decide to look on one of my friends profiles. Ws just randomly scrolling through his friends list until I notice that one of them.has 3 mutual friends with me...

How much of a coincidence was that?? I went to one of the most busy cities on the planet, and there's STILL some sort of connection to other people I've met back in the UK lmao.

Does anyone else go through a week-long phase every year or so where they get insanely excited about solotravel?,"That's what's been happening to me this week! I've been nonstop reading through posts on this subreddit, looking through my old travel blog/photos, researching plane tickets, visa requirements and so on.... I think being all cooped up in quarantine is giving me even more travel-lust

So as a result I decided to plan on my next big trip! In March of 2023, I will have been at my current job for three years and will have certainly saved up more than enough to take a year off for solotravel. I plan on giving my notice and then starting my travels in May of that year. Here is my loose itinerary:

# PART 1: THE MEDITERRANEAN, EASTERN &amp; CENTRAL EUROPE

**May:** Fly to Israel via Birthright. Since I'm Jewish I can go on an all-expenses-paid 10 day trip to Israel. The catch is it's not solotravel because I'll be with a group, and also I'm really not a Zionist, but hey it's a free plane ride to the middle east. After the trip is over I plan on hoping over to Istanbul where I'll spend the rest of the month couchsurfing and exploring the city

**June:** Start moving westward. I'd like to check out Sofia and Athens. Maybe I'll find a workaway/helpx program to join for a few weeks

**July**: Work my way up the Adriatic Sea and check out Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia.

**August:** Head to Budapest and spend 2-3 weeks there. This was my favorite city when I did my very first solotrip in 2012 and I always wish I could have spent more than just a few days there. Towards the end of the month, I'll start working my way north into Slovakia and then Poland where I'd like to pay my respects at a concentration camp.

**September:** Head to Berlin, where I'll spend most of the month couchsurfing or helpxing. I have some friends there from my 2016 SEA trip I'd like to reconnect with!

# PART 2: THE HIMALAYAS &amp; SOUTH ASIA

**October:** With the cold weather approaching in Europe, it'll be time to change things up! I plan on flying from Berlin to Kathmandu to spend a month trekking. I hear this is the best time of year as the monsoon will have just ended

**November:** India! After I'm done trekking I'd like to check out Delhi and Rajasthan. As usual I'll be couchsurfing, helpxing and staying in hostels

**October:** Start working my way further south and spend a good chunk of time in Mumbai

**November:** Continue southward and spend time in Goa

**December:** Explore the southern tip of India I guess? I honestly have no idea what's even there and what to expect but why not!

**January:** Sri Lanka! I think I could spend a month here

**February:** If at this point I've had enough of South Asia, I'd like to check out Japan for a month before heading back home (big bucketlist item is to stay in a capsule hotel). I'm thinking a couple weeks in Tokyo, a couple weeks exploring rural japan.

**March:** Pit stop in Costa Rica to see some family and then head back to the USA to begin job hunting and piecing my life back together!

How's this all sound? Is it crazy to be planning like this 2 1/2 years ahead of time? I feel like my India plan could be more fleshed out, I really don't know much about India, but I guess that's part of the appeal!",solotravel,Retawekaj
Solar Basics,"I tried searching but haven’t seen much of anything here or elsewhere in Reddit, so I thought here would be an appropriate place to ask.

Serendipitous solo travel moments,"I remember when I was making my way from Vietnam to Thailand. I was sitting in the Hanoi airport on the way to Bangkok and made eye contact with another traveler taking the same flight. I didn’t really think anything of it until we noticed each other again waiting for a taxi in Chiang Mai. We went our separate ways but were again brought together at a 7-11 a  number of hours later buying the same snacks and water. 

At this point, we spoke and decided the coincidence was too strong to ignore. We shared the rest of the evening at a nearby bar, had a great conversation, drinks, and food, and then parted our separate ways. It was as if we’d known each other for years - such an impactful experience. I tried to get her contact info so we could meet up in the future, but must've taken it down incorrectly so I never saw her again.

Quality Vs Quantity? Visiting a few places longer or many places shorter?,"\*\*\*Post Covid Plans\*\*\*

Hi, i've had the opportunity to travel to 10 cities in Europe and 3 in South America. I'm 28.

My plan is to visit major cities for 5-7 days and pick favorite ones to re-visit. I really enjoyed this for my past travels.

However, older people suggest it's better to travel to less cities and spend more time.

I fear when i'm older, i'll regret not seeing so many places since I spend so much time in a few.

"How to go out in ""riskier"" countries?","Hey!

So I've traveled to a few places before and stayed at hostels. However this has been mainly in Western Europe and Japan. Japan is extremely safe and I feel comfortable walking home with someone I met at the hostel completely shit faced at 2 in the morning. The same goes for European countries where I know what I'm doing. Of course there is always a safety risk but I see the risk as quite low. But here comes my problem: in poorer places or just places that are not as safe, how do you go out? I'm asking this because I'm currently in Colombia but I'm too afraid to do anything. I'll go out during the day and explore but avoid the bad areas (again being very cautious) and have an early dinner and stay at the hostel. I'm afraid to go out in to the dark streets of Colombia and go drinking somewhere. If we are in a big group I'll go out but avoid having more than a beer. I constantly read stories here about people going out and drinking,doing drugs etc. This is what I like and what I want but don't dare to. This question is not Colombia specific, I'm asking about all countries that wouldn't be considered ""very safe"", so even countries in SEA like Vietnam or Thailand.   


So, how do you guys do it? Maybe I'm too cautious since I avoid many situations even during daytime while alone exploring. But then again, I don't want to get robbed or worse, injured in any way.   


All responses are very appreciated!",solotravel,bandersnatche
What's the most affordable city you've been to with the best amenities for everyday living?,"For me it would have to be Medellin. You could take the metro and cable car everywhere and Uber is dirt cheap. Airbnb's are plentiful and you can find nice rooms for 200 a month or sometimes even less. Restaurants give great discounts with their ""menu del dia"" options which helps cut costs even more. On top of this it's a beautiful city with great nightlifte, etc. So far it's been difficult for me to find places that compare. 

When things calm down I was thinking of returning to Medellin for a while to work remotely, but at the same time I'd like to explore other areas. I still haven't gotten the chance to venture out to Eastern Europe and SEA, which are next on my list.

Greece May 2021 questions,"Seeking feedback on a planned solo trip to Greece 2021, COVID situation dependent.

I’m primarily interested in hiking/exploring with bars and music at night. Beaches are nice, but swimming not a focus on this one. 

I’m date flexible, but trying to balance good weather (not a fan of overcast) and meeting other travelers with beating the stampede. 

Tentative schedule

May 4/5th: USA -&gt; Athens (get in 10pm)

May 6th or 7th: -&gt; Rhodes

(Possible ferry to Fethiye/Bodrum In here)

May 12th: -&gt; Crete

May 16th: -&gt; Athens

May 17th: Delphi day trip

May 18th: -&gt; USA 

# Date questions 

1. Is this too early weather wise? I’m under the impression that Rhodes especially, but also Crete will likely have sunny weather, and great temp for hikes. But would bumping to mid/end of May be wise? 
2. Likewise, from a seasonal perspective. I know COVID adds uncertainty here, but should stuff mostly be open by early May? Will anyone be around? As a solo, I certainly don’t want to be in a ghost town.

# Crete vs Paros/Naxos 
My first choice is probably Paros/Naxos instead of Crete since it’s so huge and intimidating with the limited time I have. I also like being able to day trip from Paros to Naxos for hiking (and possibly Santorini). However, I’m under the impression Crate should be much more active by early May than Paros/Naxos and much easier to get to from Rhodes. Is this likely the case? Is it worth pushing to mid/end May and switch to Paros?

# Turkey
Is it worth making time to hit Fethiye or Bodrum from Rhodes? Especially if I can extend the trip by a few days? I’d really like to do it, assuming the ferries will be running at that time, and it won’t be a headache. 

I’ve been reading a ton of info online about solo traveling Greece, but I’d love any advice anyone can give about where and when to go. And tips for Solo in the Greece islands.

"I'm lost. I want to live abroad but I don't know if it's possible or where to start. Just kind of poured my thoughts out and would appreciate insight or advice. Not sure where to ask so I just posted here, sorry if it doesn't belong.","*Preface as to where I'm at with school and how I feel about jobs-* 

I’m a junior in high school and coming to terms with the fact that I have an entire life ahead of me independent from my parents. I have to make something of my life. I have to find fulfillment and happiness, and at the same time be self sufficient. There are an inconceivable amount of possibilities yet I have to hone down on a singular path. I have to take a first step and I don’t exactly know what it should be. 

School has been a mess and I have absolutely zero passion or interest in any class I’ve taken. I suppose some aspects of literature and history have been interesting here and there, but the work revolving around anything related to school is so draining. It’s incredibly hard to motivate myself to do homework or to study and I can’t imagine pursuing an actual career related to the subjects I’ve stumbled across. The thought of being rooted in one place pursuing some career in whatever field my college degree happens to be in sounds horrible. 

There’s something about tasks that require lots of thinking where I’m expected to meet a deadline that doesn’t click with me. Writing essays, studying calculus, reading about cellular respiration, and anything in between is incredibly hard. I just can’t focus on it. I have a much easier, relaxing time doing mundane, physical tasks like mowing a lawn or stocking shelves than I do complex tasks that require deeper thought. Maybe it’s like this for everyone, but I guess I don’t have the stamina or willpower for it. It’s too hard and too stressful. If I’m going to have to work to make money I’d rather it be something easy than it be something hard. 

I’m content with the thought of working a low paying, low skill job for the rest of my life. I feel it's wishful thinking to believe there’s a sizable chance I’ll find a job that I enjoy doing, and I’m sure most people end up not liking the job they get stuck with. Might as well cut my losses rather than try to grasp at something that’s not there. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Travel related part-*

This leads me to my issue. There is an abundance of trades that pay relatively well, or even just jobs managing the local walmart or whatever, but anything in the states just sounds boring and depressing. Living in the same town for years on end is boring. The world genuinely interests me and I want to explore it. I want to travel, and not the sight-seeing vacation type, but just experience everything. I wanna be able to settle down in any old European town and live there until I grow bored of it and wish to seek a new culture or landscape. I don’t care for the materialistic side of things like having a nice home or nice cars. As long as I have my basic necessities covered and I’m not homeless I’m sure I’ll be fine. 

The problem is I don’t know if it’s possible to pick up jobs in foreign countries, especially if I’m not fluent in the language. I don’t know if I’ll just be able to show up in a city and find employment relatively quickly. Maybe I will need to settle down someplace in the states and work to save money by living below my means so that I can afford to travel the world X amount of months out of every year. 

It’s so overwhelming and I’m having trouble articulating my thoughts. I really do just want to go out and explore the world, live my life in the moment. I don’t want to be tied down with a family driving my kids to soccer every weekend, working my 9-5 so that I can pay the mortgage on my house in the suburb and put food on the table. I’m just scared I’m gonna graduate and go move to Europe with 10,000 dollars in my bank account, stay for a month unable to find employment and end up on the streets with nowhere to go. Maybe I should get a college degree so I have something to default on. I just want to live this nomadic lifestyle and experience what there is to experience, but I don’t know where to start. I don’t even know if it’s possible. I’m not even sure this entire rant even makes sense, but I’d appreciate any advice or insight.",solotravel,imadrowninmysorrows

Spending Christmas/New Years Eve on the road,"Hey folks, has anyone here spent Christmas and/or New Years eve solo travelling, if so, where did you go and how was the experience been?

I've travelled for 2 years in a row now to Belgium and Germany for the days between 26th Dec to 31st - usually non eventful days off for me anyway so I just go on a quick trip to Europe. 

For me, I actually enjoy going for a quick trip during those times, its very quiet as you would expect, but to me its actually nice to walk around and see the sights in peace away from large crowds.

Its ironic as well because I feel the 'Christmas spirit' more so when I am away from home, maybe due to the extremely cold winter and the chance to drink gluhwein or whatever haha.

I'm thinking of actually spending the whole period abroad - obviously not this year but maybe for next NYE and beyond. I normally stay in hostels, wonder if they are empty by new years eve?

Possibly just around Europe again to save a bit.

Any painters on the road? What's in your bag? Tips?,"I've just recently started to pick up watercolor as a stress relief hobby. I used to paint for fun in school, but stopped over a decade ago--losing all my penmanship and dexterity since I only use my hands for typing these days. I'm just starting to relearn everything, but really liking it so far. 



I like the idea of plein air painting. I love the quiet people-watching moments that solo travel allows, when you have all the time in the world to sit and soak in the ambiance. Usually I just absent-mindedly drink some coffee and leave when I'm done, but I figure plein air painting would be a great way to really appreciate my environment and commit it to memory. There's been so many instances solo traveling where I want to soak in my environment and have an excuse to sit around for an hour lol. 


Does anyone else paint on the road? If so, what are your supplies? Do you have any advice or recommendations? I've bought one of those mini tins that can cram 18 watercolour half pans, but I'm looking for small brushes and other mini equipment that won't take up much space. I'm into minimalist travel, and it'd be great if I could find supplies to fit in small spaces for backpack-less day trips (eg with a small fanny pack or crossbody purse).

Does this look as bad as it looks? Awkward solo travel moment...,"I was on a plane from Tangier to Rome seated next to a very sweet old lady wearing a hijab. She spoke no English, and I speak no Arabic nor Spanish, though between us we made a little headway with our equally shaky French and plenty of friendly gesticulating.

At some point in the flight I realised I smelled very much like a smelly backpacker. So, when I had to go to the bathroom, I took my roll-on with me to freshen up a bit out of consideration for my friendly seatmate. I was in the plane’s toilet cubicle and there wasn’t much left in the roll-on bottle (one of those Nivea ones with the thick gel-liquid-stuff) so I shook it to get it the dregs to go onto the ball.

Horrifyingly, the ball popped off the end of the bottle (which has *never ever* happened to me before) and the fucking deodorant flung out in a slash all over the mirror, basin and my jeans. The deodorant gel was white, not clear, so I started panicking and thinking “I have GOT to get this off my pants.” I tried wiping it with toilet paper but that just pilled and made grains of toilet paper stick to my leg and crotch in an incriminating blotchy white line.

It definitely looked as bad as it looked. I’d been in the bathroom for ages at that point and eventually had to head back to my seat with a long white stain down the groin and left leg of my black skinny jeans. There was nothing discrete about my re-entry and my new friend refused to gesticulate with me for the rest of the trip. Shame – a lost opportunity.

Month long solo UK trip - Summer 2021 - Is this feasible?,"Hey solotravel!

With news of the vaccine being great across the board (so far and fingers crossed), I am starting to look to Europe for a long awaited solo trip. I am specifically planning a trip **around the UK in the June for a little over a month** and I am curious of everybody's thoughts around here on the details of my trip, specifically from a solo traveler perspective because I'll be totally alone for basically all of this and I figure folks around here have done similar trips in the past.

I am an American and I have never been to the UK (only been to Europe once as a high schooler in Italy), so I am a noob across the board. But I really want to see a bunch of stuff. 

**Here's my trip outline:**

* **London** - June 2nd-June 7th (**4 full days** in London, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Liverpool** - June 7th-June 10th (**1 full day** in Liverpool, 1 day trip to Manchester, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Edinburgh** - June 10th-June 15th (**4 full days in Edinburgh**, 1 day trip to Loch Lomond, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Glasgow** - June 16th-June 20th (**3 full days in Glasgow**, two travel days in/out)
* **Belfast** - June 20th-June 23rd (**2 full days in Belfast**, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Dublin** - June 23rd-June 25th (**2 full days in Dublin**, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Birmingham** - June 26th-July 2nd (**3 full days in Birmingham**, 1 day trip to Oxford, 1 day trip to Cambridge, 2 travel days in/out)
* **London** - July 2nd-July 6th (**3 full days in London, 2 travel days in/out)**

When I say travel in/out I basically mean half days where traveling is the priority, so for that first London date I'd be flying in on the 2nd and leaving for Liverpool on the morning of the 7th.

Are there any stops on here that are way too long? I don't need to be go-go-go for every part of this trip, I wouldn't mind relaxing here and there. I tried to build that rest into some of the Birmingham time because I figure I'll be a bit worn out by then, and that town is centrally located and low key so I thought it'd be good for day trips and rest. Again I'm alone so I'm really just into museums and nature and wandering around.

I plan on using trains to get around for the most part, though I have become aware that renting a car may be easier for an American than I originally thought. So we'll see on that!

Does anything stick out as red flags on this trip? I'm really just looking for general thoughts and reactions from seasoned travelers. I appreciate any feedback! Obviously, this is all COVID contingent, so here's hoping that the vaccine distribution is successful across the world.

**EDIT:** Thanks so much for all of the advice so far! It sounds like the consensus is for sure that it is too city heavy right now and that I should lean more towards smaller towns and countrysides. I think I am going to take that to heart for sure. The other advice is that Ireland and Northern Ireland are worth doing separately and I think I am starting to agree with that. Also I'm impressed only one person corrected that Dublin is not in the UK haha, I know that but looking at the map it made for an easy loop around. I understand it's a whole different place though.

I'm starting to think that I will reduce the number of nights in the cities and do some research on specific spots across the mainland that would be a bit smaller/more nature focused. I'm also thinking that if this does go on to be the first leg in a greater European trip, maybe I can round out the trip in Ireland at the end and spend more time outside of its cities.

I really appreciate all of the advice! This has been so helpful so far.",solotravel,l0ngstorySHIRT

This is also something I’m planning for in the future, hopefully once COVID slows down so I can visit other countries/cities while I’m out there. So any tips on preparing before the move would be helpful as well. I know a good amount of vocabulary but struggle with listening/speaking/sentence structure. I’ve considered Argentina and Chile the most, but am afraid that the big cities I have in mind will still speak a fair amount of English and counter my whole reason for the move.

I can't leave my house because I have to take care of a parent who has a condition whereby getting COVID can be very dangerous. By April or May I can leave because my dad is gonna come back from abroad. 

I can feel that my social abilities are becoming weaker. I feel awkward even when talking to friends on Zoom.

I was planning to backpack South America around May-July, but I realized that most international borders may still be closed to tourists and there would be many restrictions.

How can I meet people while doing so? Where should I go? What should I do specifically? 

I would like to interact with lots of people so that I can practice social skills, lose any awkwardness I feel now, and regain whatever I lost during this period.

With many vaccines about to be distributed, when should we realistically expect to be able to travel freely and enjoy the world unfettered by masks and restrictions? Europe, SE Asia, and South America may have different timelines.

I'm hoping for the best, but planning for the worst. The bankers (Goldman Sachs) announced they believe 70% of the developed world will be vaccinated by fall 2021.

Considering realistic expectations, I'd wager that it's really not until 2022 that we have a return to normal, assuming no surprises. Regionally 2021 will be better for everyone, but international travel may still be restricted, or at a minimum you'd still encounter covid-related obstacles around the world.

I'm reconsidering my plan to quit my job in spring 2021 and travel. May need to wait...

"Working holiday visa - Australia, Share your story","Hey!

I'm looking into moving to Australia on a working holiday visa for 6 months - 1 year, (idk for how long yet) after the pandemic and after I graduate university.

I don't expect to find a job that is related to my degree (business administration), but i'm thinking cafe jobs or construction jobs etc.  Should I look for jobs before I go?

Tried to do a local trip by myself,"I feel like it was a fail cause I ended up chickening out. Basically I booked this Airbnb which wasn’t far from where I live to go hiking by myself. When I got there it was like middle of nowhere and tbh I was immediately uncomfortable because there were a bunch of White supremacists signs on a few peoples homes in the area. But since I already paid for everything i decided to stay. The Airbnb was pretty nice and relaxing with a view of the lake. Then I went out to the hiking trail. I kinda got lost and my car was not suitable for the terrain so I had to leave it. I started walking to the trail it was bright and sunny but a little cold. I did see a few older people on the trail. For some reason I felt really uncomfortable being alone. I just couldn’t do it and turned back. 

I went back to the Airbnb. Basically I ordered food got some wine, watched Home Alone and went to sleep. The next morning I left my trip early and went home. I don’t know why but I just was feeling really sad. I’ve always wanted to do this and it just didn’t work out. I’ve always went on trips with people (family, friends, former partners, etc) this was supposed to be my first solo trip and it just sucked. My anxiety, depression and stuff since my breakup really messed with my head 

I’m gonna try again and research better next time. But anyway, i know this wasn’t really traveling since it was only a short road trip away.

Edit: Thank you to everyone for the support. Really makes me feel better about the whole situation. I forgot to mention the dog at the Airbnb! He was super adorable and a really large dog. It also made my day",solotravel,funguy202

Which big trip should I do first? (SEA or Eastern Europe?),"Hello everyone! 

So, as the vaccine news draws in I’m getting really excited about travel &amp; want to do a long, big solo trip as soon as it’s possible. Im hoping next autumn, like September or October of 2021. I’ve been debating between Southeast Asia or Eastern Europe. I’ve planned both out, but I’m not sure which to do first! Doing them back to back would be great, but I don’t think I would have the money to make it work. 

For SEA im hoping to spend 4-6 months there going through Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore &amp; Malaysia.

For Eastern Europe I would be hoping to spend 4ish months going through Slovenia, Albania. Croatia, Slovakia, Romania, Greece, Ukraine, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro &amp; Hungary.

Another option would be working as an English teacher in France from Oct 2021-May 2022, then going backpacking from there, but I think I would have a lot less money if I did that, so am kind of considering putting it on the back burner.

Travellers on Capitalism,"I'm a 24 year old male from Canada and I feel as though I have no direction in life. This might not be the right subreddit to talk about this but I feel travelers have a great perspective on life. I'm currently working and the job by all accounts is fine, but I'm starting to get into the 9-5 grind and I'm not excited about the prospect of doing this for the next 40 years. I've been thinking about on moving to a larger city maybe doing a program overseas like JET before COVID, but with it has come a delay which has left me a lot of time for contemplation. 

I have a good career trajectory but I feel as though I've been on the rollercoaster of life without much of my own say in the matter and now here I am. I can continue down this path and live a life of comfort and stability, which I can build upon with family and friends and no doubt will I be happy, as I understand these are luxuries are not provided to all who walk this world but there's still a part of me that yearns for something different. I think this comes from my past of traveling doing three separate solo travel trips. These trips have certainly impacted my life and made me less reliant on physical items for happiness and more on experiences which goes against the capitalist system that we as humans are forced to live within, so I guess my questions lies there. I assume most travellers live with the ideology of experiences over materialism, but how are we to cope with life when reality by all accounts forces us down a path of capitalism and conformity?

Solo Travel while Partnered,"Howdy, everyone. 

Does anyone have any advice for not feeling guilty about traveling solo while you’re partnered?

I discovered solo travel after a manipulative and emotionally abusive relationship, and it’s truly become a part of who I am.  My longest trips have been 3 weeks in Southeast Asia and 4 weeks in Portugal and Spain.  I love seeing the world and connecting with my inner-most self.

I’m lucky to be in a secure and loving relationship, now, and my partner embraces, supports, and actually encourages my solo travel.  It feels weird, to be honest!

(As an aside, we also travel together and I enjoy it, but solo travel is still my favorite.)

Does anyone have any suggestions for combating that guilty feeling?  I feel like I “should” want to travel with him more than I want to travel solo (even though I know this is a cognitive distortion and I’m lucky to have a partner that gets it that solo travel is part of my DNA).

Do most people travel carrying their passport on them at all times. The moment I arrive in a place I immediately lock up my passport in either the hostel storage locker or hotel room I’m staying in. Only time I have it on me is in the airport or crossing borders if needed. I usually just carry my US state ID with me in case I need identification for anything.

Is there a reason people carry it with them at all times that I’m missing? Or should I be carrying it with me at all times?

Help me with my first international solo trip! (Tulum),"Hey everybody! I’m going to be as descriptive as I can about this in the hopes of it not being removed and actually being able to help me out. 

I have my first international solo trip coming up on May 8-16 in Tulum. Fingers crossed the virus is in a much better place by then. 

I am trying to come up with a rough itinerary on things to do and places to stay. 

I will have a rental car the entire 8 days. 

My MAIN question that is killing me, has to do with additional excursions that aren’t the easiest to do. 

I’m trying to decide if I want to take a ferry to Cozumel on my arrival day and spend 1 night there before getting to Tulum. And my second question is do I want to drive all the way down to Punta Allen and do I want to stay a night there? 

If the trip to Cozumel is suggested I was thinking of leaving my rental car in Playa del Carmen and renting a Classic Beetle to drive around the island for the day. 

The type of activities I am looking to do are more adventurous and seeing nature than spending a week on the beach. I will probably spend 1 maybe 2 days on the actually beach. 

Certain things I’m specifically looking at doing are the river float in Sian Ka’an. Going to Cenotes. A group dinner experience. Seeing Mayan ruins. Snorkeling with the sea turtles. 

I’m thinking of staying in a mix of hotels and hostels, this would be my first time ever staying at a hostel.

I would love to experience traveling throughout the Middle East.

What's an European country or city to travel to that doesn't feel like Europe?,"Considering Corona is probably easing up with the rollout of vaccines within the next few months, what would be a good European country or city to visit alone, that doesn't feel like you're still in Europe?

It'd be nice to not have that feeling if that makes sense? Like when traveling to the US and you see the skyscrapers and realise you're actually abroad for example.

Have you ever taken a solo photoshoot while travelling?," I think that one of the worst parts of solo travel  is being stuck with selfies.

Most of the time i've take them on a tripod with a self timer and they turn out okay, but i don't always feel safe to do so. It's always a risk putting your phone or expensive camera on a tripod and stand far away from it to take a picture. Anybody could snatch it off in a matter of seconds.

Social versus safety when traveling?,"I've been reading all these posts about people who go solo travel, meet some cool new people, go out drinking and all that stuff. the question that's been nagging at me throughout my solo traveling experiences is- How do you all balance this with safety? 

I know of somebody who went traveling, made some new friends, went out drinking with them - and woke up in a gutter with all their stuff stolen and had to get an emergency passport back to the US.

Personally when I solo travel, I pretty much have eyes in the back of my head. I do not trust random strangers who are inviting me to go check something out, and don't really care to get inebriated, because if I get drunk and in a bad situation, there's no one to come save me. Also I'm relatively lightweight.

Your dumbest mistake while solotravelling?,"While we shouldn't be out travelling during the pandemic so what's there to do other than sharing our brainbloopers and learning from them perhaps.


I've shared this mistake in another thread with similar theme, but oh what a costly error of thinking. 

I was finally travelling home from Southeast Asia after spending a month in Vietnam. I didn't book a flight home as I had no specific deadline other than a loosely set date. 


Browsed the web on my phone, found a reasonable price - a bit late in the night 00:10, but to save money I'm no stranger to travelling late, can even sleep on the flight so not even a bad choice after all.


So here's the fuck up, I booked the flight home for 25th of June, 00:10. Not optimal with checkout times but I figured I would just travel a day early to get closer to the airport, check into a cheap hostel. So I did, checked out from the hotel and booked a taxi to the hostel. Had a day to rest out and do literally nothing. I arrived at the airport the 25th of June around 21:50, ready for a long flight.


Made my way to the lists of flights and gates that's continously updated. Stood there like a dumb fuck staring, looking for my flight for atleast 5 minutes. Waiting to see if the rolling list was just playing a trick on my mind, making me miss my specific flight.


Eventually when looking down at my phone and checking my flight reservation I realized I had missed my fucking flight. It's about to hit 26th of June 00:10. Not only did I miss it, but I missed it by an entire day.


After sighing internally and declaring myself dumb for another solid 5 minute which felt like an hour I quickly began looking up new flights. Instead of paying 550 euros back home I'm now paying 700 euro, and not until the day after. But I'm a belief of the you live and you learn, plus I'm not by any means rich but I'm not poor either so I always budget for major fucks up like this even if it did sting like a bitch.


**tl:dr** Booked flight for 25th of June 00:10, thought this meant I could go to the airport the 25hth of June close to midnight and make my flight but obviously it's about to be 26th of June.

Taking a pet with you while going abroad,"Hi! I'm a senior in college and I recently found a stray cat and really want to keep him.

"Footwear for Central Asia, Caucasus","Hi all,

As the title suggests, I’m planning a trip to Central Asia and the Caucasus for the future.

As I would be in the regions in spring, from March - June, that precipitates the need for good footwear. I have a pair of Eccos for walking and cities, but need a second option. 

Deciding between a hiking shoe, trail runner, and sneaker. Obviously all have their own plaudits, but my main concern is use outside of the mountains and grinding down the logs on asphalt or concrete.

I roll up to the hostel and say tell me what to do, give me some tips, what's your favorite spots, and then from there ask them where I should head to next.

Yes, this does end up being more expensive, a harder learning experience....but that's the fun in it. Those tips on ""10 things I wish I knew before going \_\_\_\_\_\_"" nope I skip out on. I learn the hard way, and those bumps in the road make it more memorable.

"The pandemic is kind of like a travel ""tolerance break"". Anyone else feel they got an interestingly positive perspective reset?","Well here's my rant for the month, not really a question. I fucking hate this pandemic, and I hate being stuck domestic, but there's a tiny silver lining for me anyway. 

About a year ago,  I took my first solo trip and never looked back on whether or not I'd like the idea. I was less than a year into really moving on from domestic travel (been to most cool cities in the US) to primarily going abroad. I did as many countries in 2019 as I had in my life prior. I had a cushy remote job, which meant workations on top of good salary and paid vacations. 

Then 2 days before I am supposed to leave for Colombia, borders shut down. 

Slowly but surely I started forgetting (or becoming a bit numb to) what I loved about travel and why, I got used to not seeing and hopping on flight deals I find just because. The unknowns of solo travel started to be nerve wracking again when I contemplated future trips. 

**But.** 

Distance does make the heart grow fonder. As I look at my potential future journeys, I'm looking upon them less methodically, with a fresh set of eyes, a new sense of adventure, and in a way rediscovering why I want to see the world. 

It's not often that I get to reset that bewilderment and innocence of doing something new that I end up loving; the pandemic hitting right as I started to become semi-nomadic did give me a minute to evaluate and experience that again. It is kind of a cool feeling, to be honest.

Can we talk about all the travel vloggers in Mexico?,"I am curious on your opinion of the exodus of travel vloggers who have ""moved"" to Tulum and the Yucatan during a global pandemic.

Is this acceptable? It has become painful to watch some of my previously favourite travel vloggers living like life is bliss under the veil of ignorance that has become Tulum right now.

I understand these individuals live this lifestyle as a livelihood - but I am curious if this is seen as acceptable behaviour by this sub?

Alternatives to kindle,"Hey friends
I have always been an avid reader and love to take at least two books with me whenever i travel but they do take up space and weight.

Any sites that give a Numerical Rating to travel destinations? (i.e. 7.5/10),"Are there any sites that give a numerical rating to travel destinations? Like 4.3/5 or 7.5/10?

IMDB does this for movies, and Goodreads does this for books. It's very helpful in deciding what to watch or read.

I was hoping to find something similar for travel destinations (specifically Stockholm, Toronto, Indonesia, and Singapore), to determine which trip to prioritize after Covid. However, TripAdvisor doesn't seem to have this kind of general rating.. just rankings for specific sights.

Anyone know of anything like this?",solotravel,Clollin
Is it still possible to travel from continent to continent by cargo ship?,"Reading the books of such authors as Jack Kerouac or Gary Snyder (two huge solo-travel heroes of mine) it seems that traveling from, say, Europe to India by cargo ship is an incredibly cool way to do it. You have days and weeks all for yourself, all that ocean around you, time to think and reflect etc. 

So now I am wondering: Is it nowadays still possible to kind of ""hop"" on a cargo ship? Not illegally I mean - and also not through sites like this one [https://www.cargoshipvoyages.com/](https://www.cargoshipvoyages.com/), where you have to pay 3.000 dollars or more.  
I am looking for something very basic and affordable. I don't need a nice cabin, I am happy to sleep in a dorm with the sailors, for example.  
Also I guess that in these days of highly optimized crews, it is not possible anymore to just show up by the docks and offer to peel potatoes in exchange for a trip from Port Said to Hong Kong, like you could do 50 years ago.

Does anybody have any info on this? Any relevant links? Or maybe even some experience?",solotravel,HitchhikingToNirvana
Feeling like there are so many places to go and not enough time,"This thread is just to get these feelings off my chest, there's no real question or point.

I love making lists of places I want to go. I love creating rough plans, writing down all the activies I want to do and the cities I want to see. I think about the food I want to eat. Maybe I'll do a workaway on a vineyard. Maybe I'll get scuba certified or do a silent meditation retreat. I love art museums. There are so many hikes around the world I want to do, I would love to go to every national park (I live in the US). Most of the individual trips would be 3 weeks to a month minimum to really immerse myself and do all these things that I want to do.

I get a rush when making these lists but then after I feel kinda sad. I'm turning 27 tomorrow, it's like time slips by so fast. Obviously with COVID I couldn't travel out of the country even if I wanted to, but still. I feel the pressure to constantly work. Will I ever have that amount of time off, what are the chances of it being every year? I wish I had started traveling when I was younger when I had summers off. The thought of the years going by and not doing these things makes me feel empty. 

Not much else to say but thanks for letting me vent! None of my friends are very interested in traveling (totally fine, I don't mind going solo) so I appreciate this community.",solotravel,arabesuku

Changes in your life after a solotravel experience ?,"Hello fellow redditors, I was wondering what was some of the big changes that travels had on you, in a mental or practical way. 

 Mine : I travelled in latin america for 8 months 2 years ago, volunteering in Peru and travelling around Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Colombia.

What are your stories ?",solotravel,PotatoAlcoholic
Solo U.S.A. Minivan woman traveler - looking for courage / advice,"Hello! I’m new to reddit and enjoying this sub, looking for courage and advice for the next step of my heavy solo traveling life.

I’ve travelled solo since I was 21, when I went 3 weeks early to my London study abroad semester and booked a 2 wk UK tour with strangers...followed by solo trips to Ireland and Scotland, and a partly solo 5 country European tour in 9 days (lots of alone time, traveling w two near-strangers, did all the planning/routes, mainly using Rick Steve’s’ Europe Through The Back Door :). 

(Actually my FIRST time w solo travel was on a plane at 12, to Boston / Lake Winnepesaukee NH, to visit my best friend...wow just remembered that :)

Since then I’ve toured and travelled solo most my life, moved to NYC for 2 years for grad school and would take impulsive trips to Montauk or back to Chicago (near where I’m from originally), etc, joined a touring children’s theatre for 2 years and ran off on solo excursions with the van sometimes, and now, I’m a spontaneous singer-songwriter, taking nature drives and ‘songwriting adventure’ trips every month (mostly in nature since covid), and before covid, was booking frequent 4-6 day solo Midwest tours. Sometimes to based around where family lived, sometimes with strangers to play DIY basement / attic shows, developing new friendships and sleeping there, and sometimes just to get away completely solo and write songs in new places (changes in perspective help me), and in those cases, booking motel rooms or Air BnBs.

But I’m at a huge turning point and could use a pep talk lol...bought a minivan last year for touring (Sienna LE, tinted windows) and I teach piano lessons for income and currently they are all virtual and I might keep it that way permanently going forward...so I realized I could afford to travel solo a LOT more often in the future (post-covid), if I SLEPT in it! 

So far I haven’t done it, I’ve heard you can park overnight in Walmart parking lots...but I’m a little concerned about bathrooms and safety.

I’m 4’11 so comfort isn’t an issue, I’ll fit no problem...and I slept on floors on tour anyway. It’s more that I have a history of some sexual trauma so I’m less adventurous than I was around possibly unsafe things...like I wouldn’t do mixed dorms in hostels now, for instance. I’m also not sure how I’d feel parking in a secluded place...like rest stops in rural areas. BUT I dumped way too much money into cheap motels on my last cross-country trip, and I don’t want that to deter my *hopeful* (covid-wise) late 2021 adventures, sooooo...

Do you have experience sleeping in vans or RVs, parking in unconventional places? Any advice for bathrooms or safety? Any weird or bad experiences to share, with this solitary sleep-in-vehicle approach to adventure and travel? 

Eep this is my first post! Can’t wait to hear responses!

(in The Rainbow :)

TL;DR - I have travelled solo for 20 years but only slept in a car one time, a Prius (and I felt like a bird in a cage or an easy target), and I want support/ideas/encouragement from anyone who regularly travels and sleeps in their car/van. My new van has tinted windows but should I make curtains? Where do you go to the bathroom? Do you park places other than Walmart parking lots? Lol, Kay bye!  Thanks everyone!",solotravel,jessinrainbow
Puerto Escondido vs Puerto Vallarta For Solo Traveler?,"Hey all,

I planned a trip to Mexico for Mid-December. I have a choice between going to Puerto Escondido or Puerto Vallarta for 7 days.

All I'm looking to do is Wake up &amp; Surf, Work from the Hostel (all I need is wifi), Eat good food (maybe cook since I like to do that) and maybe go to a few bars/restaurants/walk around the city while wearing a mask of course! I'm NOT looking to do any tours, like ziplining or rafting, nothing crazy. I'd also like to go hiking (I love waterfalls) on my day off if possible. But really surfing, food, culture and being in warm weather while I work are the reasons I'm going.

A few more details:

1. I'm a beginner/intermediate surfer, I've done a few group lessons and can stand on my own if the waves aren't too crazy. Still learning to go left/right. I'm not sure if Puerto Escondido or Puerto Vallarta is better for my skill level.
2. I've already booked a hostel at each location (I get a full refund if I cancel). The Puerto Escondido Hostel is right on Playa Zicatela while the Puerto Vallarta Hostel is a 2 min walk to Rosita Beach
3. I don't plan on renting a car, but wouldn't mind renting one for a day to go hiking in Oaxaca or up/down the Pacific coast from puerto Vallarta on my day off.
4. I have a wifi extender that I can plug into an outlet to (hopefully) increase the wifi connection. I don't have a problem working in common areas of the hostel, and I work essentially 9a-5p.

Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you!!",solotravel,ukeman33

I planned out my first long Solo travel trip for two weeks in Portugal for this May. Obviously, this did not happen. Unfortunately, I was laid off in August and will have to start back at square one with the traditional two weeks (very few companies have the unpaid time off policy).

Ukraine 2020,"I wanted to share my experience traveling to Ukraine.  

I choose the country because it was open to international travelers and it was somewhere that I wouldn't normally consider.  There is an obvious language barrier.  At least in most other places in Europe they use a Latin alphabet which makes things easy.  I found that most young people spoke passible English. There is always Google Translate.  

Ukraine had resisted COVID related restrictions and just recently started to require that businesses close down at 10pm.  Some establishments are closed not because of COVID specifically but because of the economic impact of the virus on consumer spending.  

For obvious reasons the summer is the best time to visit the country.  The sunny weather allows for activities on the beach of the river Dnieper/Dnipro.  I arrived for only a couple weeks of mild weather before things got chilly.  

I got by well with a heavy thermal base layer and a sweater.  Then I bought a packable puffer jacket on Amazon.  The combo works well.  The alternative would be to invest in a fancy CanadaGoose style jacket.  Being from a warm climate I did not think that be a wise investment since I wouldn't get much use out of the heavy coat.  

Kyiv and Lviv are amazing cities.  Kyiv is the capital and the nexus of the country's airline network.  Lviv is a quaint city with a very European atmosphere.  A lot of locals think of Lviv as boring since it is such a small area but I found it to be very walkable. You can get to most places in the city center within a 15 walk.  

Uber in Ukraine is cheap.  My most expensive fare was $13 for 50 minute trip from the airport in Kyiv.  Before the advent of Uber I had previously spent $100 to get to the airport in some N. American cities.

There are plenty of excellent restaurant options in both Kyiv and Lviv.  Tinder dates are the best way to experience the dining scene.  Because of logistical complications seafood in Ukraine tends to be subpar.  I think when you freeze a good tuna steak it tends to loose a lot of flavor.  Also there is a peculiar Ukrainian style of putting cream cheese on sushi.  They often call it a Philadelphia roll.  I prefer my sushi with just sashimi and rice, but that is the local take on sushi.  

I prefer to engage with the locals rather than expats you find in the popular tourist places.  I told my dinner date how she spoke English very well.  She smiled and reminded me that ""English is an international language and you do not own it.""  I thought that was a very succinct way of putting it.  The people I meet in Ukraine where pleasant and made for interesting conversation.   

The thing I disliked about Ukraine is that you are unable to drink water from the tap.  Have you ever been stupid hungover from a night of heavy vodka drinking only to find yourself without any water.  It is a real hassle to have to lace up your boots and layer up with many articles of clothing only to stumble to the store and buy a few liters of water.  

I am glad that I travelled to Ukraine.  I would not normally consider it as a tourist destination.  I have heard good things about Georgia from many of the locals.  I am now considering flights to Tiblisi when their borders open.",solotravel,ATX-SD
What are some adventurous trips I can take starting in January?,"Here's the situation: I'm graduating college in 3 weeks and already have a job lined up for September 2021. Until then, I can do whatever I want and this is how I planned it from the beginning. I wanted to have months to explore the world and go on an adventure. I have about $20,000 saved up (currently invested but easily willing to pull out)

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's that time and covid has made me confused. I still am itching for an adventure, but I my thoughts are all over the place. Some days, I'm thinking I'll stay home and do stuff locally until a vaccine comes around, other days I'm thinking this is lame and I can't just wait around.

Here's a list of stuff I considered doing but haven't acted on anything yet:

\- drive to Utah to go skiing with a friend of a friend who will be there

\- go to Europe May-September for backpacking

\- bike across the US (the logistics of this intimidate me, especially in the winter)

\- some combination of the above

Chiapas/Yucatan 9 Day Itinerary - Doing too much?,"I'm planning a 9 day trip to Chiapas and the Yucatan. I'm wondering if there is too little time here to do either one well. Here's what I have planned:

Day 1 - Fly into Tuxtla Gutierrez. Stay the night in San Cristobal

Day 2 - San Cristobal

Day 3 - Yaxchilan/Bonampak

Day 4 - Palenque/Agua Azul

Day 5 - Travel to Valladolid - basically burning a day here

Day 6 - Hit a cenote, Ek Balam

Day 8 - Isla Holbox beach bum

Day 9 - Isla Holbox beach bum

Day 10 - Isla Holbox beach bum

Day 11 - Fly back out of Cancun

Here are my concerns:

1. I'm trying to do too much and it won't be enjoyable
2. Lots of travel time between Chiapas and the Yucatan
3. If I rent a car to get around, it will be extremely expensive to rent in Tuxtla and drop it in Cancun

Here was my thinking:

1. I am very attracted to Chiapas for the jungle atmosphere. Maybe I'm glorifying it, but it sounds a bit more ""adventury""
2. Beach days are non-negotiable, however the location is. I picked Holbox because it sounds the like the least built-up/touristy beach option, but lack of good snorkeling is a major downside.

I am thinking in take 1-3 years travelling,"Hello guys, i am thinking in travel around the world in may-jun of the next year IF the vaccine and covid are getting better. I don't know for how long my travel will be. This is part of my doubts.

I am an asian male of 25 years born and raised in Brazil.I work as a doctor and everyone says to me that i need to do my residency first ( specialize to be a cardiologist, neuro, intensivist, whatever ...) that will take me another 3 or 5 years of my life. But i am afraid of getting to old and lose part of the magic of travelling. I know that i'm still young, but i remember when i was 18 and every travel, party or food was more magic that its today.  

I am planning to stay the majority of my time in south east asia end eastearn europe because of the cost of living. I don't know much about east europe , do you guys think it's gonna be safe for asians  to travel there after covid ?  But i want to travel to other places to like china, korea, india, israel, morroco, libanon, egypty,  new zealand, australia, USA and Canada . South america i already traveled to some places and i can always go to a quicky travel of 2 weeks because of the proximity with Brazil. 

If i make  that travel this gonna blow my economies, because our money its worthing nothing in dollars right now. . But i think that our life time has no price. Do you guys think its possible to work in places like australia , new zealand , USA or europe ? ( not as a doctor, but in farms, restaurants, hostels ... )

To the others doctor in the community, do you guys think i am crazy to leave everything behind for 1 or 3 years just to travel  ?   I don't think i will have other oportunity like this in a long time. Who know if i gonna be married with kid in 5 years or become sick or another millions of thinks that can stop me from travel for so long.  

But remember when i return i will need to take my exams, study a lot to pass in the exams and if i pass i gonna need to work 60- 90 hours for week receiving 500 dollars per month as resident doctor for more 3-5 years being older and with all my friends in other stages in life .

I'm sitting at the airport alone. Suddenly feeling really self conscious. Help!,"Let me begin by saying I haven't traveled anywhere in over a year. I've been working a lot and getting burnt out and felt like I ""needed to getaway"".

Last week I put in for some time off and booked a flight to Cancun. I told my dad and he was a little disappointed about my decision because of the whole covid situation. 

I told him my itinerary and that he can call me anytime. He told me to enjoy my trip. 

So I'm at the train station and I see this older couple in their late 50s having trouble navigating their way with the signs. 

They asked me which was the train going to the airport. I told them I was going there too. It turns out they're on the same flight as me. 

They said they wanted to follow my lead and we talk on the train for a bit on our way there. We get there and check in. I was still getting my ticket and they said they would go to the gate first. 

I said I'd meet them there. I get my ticket and get past the gates. I decide to get something to eat. I see them at the next table but I didn't want to intrude. I just wave and we say hi. 

Afterward, I go and sit near the gate when all of a sudden it hits me - I'm all by myself. 

Now I've always traveled alone. I've been close to 20 countries all alone. I've never felt so self conscious as I do right now. 

It's like you feel lonely and desperate for some type of companionship. 

I'm sure I'll meet some awesome people at my hostel like I always do but as for right now, holy shit.

Being Systematic in Choosing Next Travel Destinations,"Like all of us, I cannot wait to be able to travel again. I approached possible future international travel with a methodological approach:

I obtained the list of all countries as detailed on [WorldoMeter](https://www.worldometers.info/geography/alphabetical-list-of-countries/). Using a spreadsheet, I sorted out countries I had already visited. Then, I used Google Travel to source flights from a Midwest US city (Kansas City) to all the locations I had not yet traveled.

"Any advice, suggestion, or tips for a solo female traveler in Europe?","Hello, I’m 24F and I’m planning to tour around Europe when this pandemic is over. I have always dreamed of traveling to Europe alone (because honestly, I want to have a soul-searching/finding-myself experience). The past two years have been very difficult for me as I have experienced big changes in my life: being diagnosed with depression and anxiety, leaving law school, and ending a relationship—all of which led me to believe that I truly need and deserve to travel for myself and by myself.

I have no prior experience of traveling alone, since my previous trips to Asia, US, and UK have been with my family and friends. Hence, I’m asking for advice, suggestions, and tips on how I can make this trip to Europe fun, safe, and worthwhile. I’d appreciate it very much if you would be able to give me advice specifically on what to prepare before the trip; how to keep myself safe (esp when touring around and meeting new people); how to ease my anxieties about travelling alone; where to find the best places to go, eat, and stay. Feel free to share stories that you think might help as well.

Experiences of Black women traveling solo in Italy,"My first solo trip was a couple years back. I spent three weeks in Europe and travelled mostly in France and Italy. I loved Paris. Now, I'm a black woman and my friends had told me Italy was amazing, specifically the larger cities. I actually expected more racism in Paris by reputation, but I never had one bad experience there. I travelled by train from Paris to Milan and that was the start of the longest ten days of my life. It was a NIGHTMARE. Seeing as this was my first solo trip and I knew nothing, I had two huge suitcases. I get off the Metro at Duomo, knowing I could get a taxi to my nearby Air BNB. Massive mistake. It was July, the sun was beating down full force and empty taxi after empty taxi passed me by as I was flagging them down. At first, I chalked it up to the size of my bags, my youth, anything and everything. After close to an hour,  I even left my bags in an alcove so I could just jump in front of the next empty taxi I saw and make them take me. (I was standing in front of a traffic light, so they had to stop). I was ignored and batted away.  Finally, a kind trans person came out of a local business and called me a private taxi. That's the service I used the rest of my time in Milan, I never could get a cab just by hailing there. And I didn't have phone service so I couldn't use Uber or Lyft. I've never been so aware of my color in all my life. I'm a 450 in Fenty, cocoa girl and I had long faux locs for traveling convenience. I was staying in a residential area of Milan and people would literally stare at me when I walked down the street. 

A lot of it was racism but some of it was xenophobia against the African immigrants there. When I wore any kind of American paraphernalia I was treated WAYYYYYYY better. I moved onto Rome quickly. It was better but still awful. I'll just never know what percentage was racial. One night, I went to a ballet at La Scala and bumped into some white American tourists. And they told me about how badly they were treated as tourists! Some of what they said sounded very familiar. That leg of trip wasn't all bad. I did some great shopping, had the best gelato ever, saw the Vatican, enjoyed the Eternal City. But I don't know if I'll ever go back, not even for Venice or Naples. I felt so isolated and unsafe. Has anyone experienced this? Any suggestions?

UPDATE: Wow! I did not expect such a response. I really appreciate everyone’s feedback. Everyone who explained Milan’s taxi situation, you helped me see the whole experience from a different angle. I was in Paris for two weeks before I went to Milan, and I hailed cabs all the time-but I was also right down the street from the Luxembourg Gardens, so I’m sure there were an abundance to be had. I stayed in Trastevere in Rome, so I could walk a lot or take trams and buses. And when I would come home from attractions, I would automatically use the taxi stands, so I never really put any of that together before about the taxis in Milan. I’d always wanted to go to Italy so badly and I was disappointed when I did. So I’m grateful to everyone who suggested ways I could take back the experience or navigate similar situations more safely. I’m glad I posted here. The experience was always such a weight on me. I never talked about it with my family because they hadn’t wanted me traveling solo anyway and I didn’t want to give them any ammunition. I feel like I could give Italy a second chance now, but even if I never do, I feel cleansed of the original experience. Now that I’ve talked out the negative, I can just remember the positive, those beautiful sunsets, those lovely narrow streets, and the best gelato I’ve ever had. Thanks again for that.",solotravel,Throwawayrightaway28

Experience as a white guy in Colombia,"So for background: I’m a tall (6’4) German/Nordic looking white dude (If you want, you can see photos in my post history lol)    

Currently in Colombia for a month-long vacation. My experience in Bogotá has been completely awesome, cheap excellent food, interesting culture, so much to see and do..  

That being said, the amount of staring I get is crazy!   
I’m talking almost everybody I pass. At the very least, I get a curious glance, but more often than not it’s a full on, stop what they’re doing and stare situation. I should add it’s not unpleasant or hostile staring. More like very curious looks.    

I get it, I’m white, blondish and tall in a country of darker skin tones, black hair and (for the most part) shorter folks.

But this being a HUGE metropolitan city and also the capital of Colombia, I know they get their fair share of tourists from all over the globe.

Renting out a house while travelling,"I'm currently living with Parents (in UK) and considering buying a house and going travelling. The idea is that I would rent out the house while I travel, which should hopefully cancel out the mortgage costs, plus it would mean I have my own place to return to when I get back.

I have supportive parents who encourage this idea, saying that they will manage the tenants when I'm away, however my main concern would be that I struggle to find tenants, or that the mortgage that I pay would be a lot more expensive than the rent I receive from the tenants.

I want to know if anybody has ever gone through with this strategy and how it turned out, if it's worth the hassle etc.",solotravel,treeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Any experiences traveling alone as a woman in Iran?,"Due to covid it's obviously not on the cards yet but I've long dreamt of traveling to Iran. Ideally I would be able to go with a male companion or friend group but I prefer travelling alone.

On the difficulty of crossing busy roads without cross-walks,"I have been pondering, as I have been watching travel videos and planning lovely future-tense vacations, where the hardest places to simply cross the road are?

**Nothing brings me more stress than a difficult-to-cross road.** It was a deal-breaker for me in much of Vietnam, as I stood, my entire body hairs upright, bracing to cross several times a day for three weeks, and I would find my nervous system so aggravated by just trying to cross the road that I would spend my nights inside in defeat. I was in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Hue, Hoi An, and Can Tho, and other than Hoi An, every city was terrifying to cross at many intersections. Fastforward to Phnom Penh, and I loved it, in retrospect I think because I walked the corniche so often, although I once found myself again unable to cross a sea of motorcycles again at rush hour and wound up finally biding time in a store for an hour because I could not figure out how to cross the street -- even with locals -- without having a sort of sense of nervous collapse.

I have been to Istanbul, a city of 20 million or so, and walked across a freeway once when lost, and did not feel at all anxious. So it's not only the number of people out, but also, how they drive.

Since we can reflect now, and it has come to mind as I watch videos of Cairo, where it looks like Ho Chi Minh City all over again but cars, I find myself thinking, ""I don't want to ever go there"" or ""I'd go straight to Luxor, which could not be that bad! Nothing could be THAT bad, right?"" I'd probably stay in Giza and ask if I could ride a camel to the pyramids and sphinx, from the hotel, lol!

**I'm curious about three things now:**

* 1.) does anyone else just sometimes avoid traveling to places where they feel anxious about being run-over while crossing the street, not because they have unreasonable anxiety issues but because it's just hard? Do you find it kind of wrecks your whole day and you wind up trying to take cabs (that's what I did in Vietnam, and I am not a big fan of cabs for short distances -- I love walking the city streets!)
* 2.) Where does the good people of this subreddit think the world's hardest cities to just cross the streets are, based on personal experience, and why?
* 3.) (Optional) -- for anyone who has been to either Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi (or similar) --AND--  Cairo, or any other Egyptian cities, how did they compare? That's a kind of passing curiosity now.

Thanks for your replies! Seeking future-chill travel which doesn't make my hair stand on end and leave me curled up in a ball in my guesthouse for the rest of the day after a one-hour excursion. But moreso, I just have not seen it discussed before, and I can't be the only person who thinks of the world in terms of ""streets that seem legit"" and ""streets that scare me completely.""",solotravel,the_latest_greatest

Itinerary Help for 3 Months in Brazil,"Spending probably 3 months in Brazil starting January. Flying into and out of São Paulo and trying to figure out an itinerary. Some facts:

* I will be working while traveling and need wifi good enough for video calls
* I speak Portuguese conversationally
* Looking for easy access to outdoor activities (hiking, beach) due to COVID. I would need to be able to meet at least one other traveler to hike, since that's not an activity I want to do solo.
* I will have 2 pieces of rolling luggage with me, so not sure if a place like Jericoacoara which I've heard is all sand would be easy to get around. Don't want to look like an idiot :P
* I want to spend about a month in each location. I am not really interested in spending much time at all in SP once I've gotten my rapid test (4 days after arrival). I'm considering spending most of my time in Morro de Sao Paulo, Floripa, Rio (Carnaval will probably be cancelled like Festa Junina was, huh?) and/or Curitiba. Also interested in seeing Iguaçu, Pantanal, and Jalapão (maybe as long-weekend trips). I will almost definitely be back in Brazil after COVID, so if there's anything that will likely be difficult or pointless to try to do/see now, I can plan to do so later.
* I have friends in Salvador and intend to spend time at the end of the trip with them there, and will visit Chapada Diamantina with them

"Trying to figure out transportation in Egypt (ferries, trains). Also, please help with itinerary.","Public transportation in Egypt seems to be quite complicated. I have read that certain trains (or compartments) are accessible only for Egyptian nationals and that as a foreigner, you have to book a more expensive luxury compartment (for example for going from Cairo to Luxor).

The same for ferries. I looked into the one from Hurghada to Sharm, and the price is way more expensive for tourists. 

Is there any way to avoid these restrictions and get normal train (and maybe ferry) tickets in Egypt? Is just buying the ticket once you are already on the train a viable option?

I wan to see the following places: 

- Cairo
- Luxor
- Aswan
- Dahab
- Mt. Sinai
- Maybe Alexandria 
- Maybe Abu Simpel

I am flying either into Hurghada or Sharm. If it is the latter, I guess it would be a good idea to start my trip in Dahab and spend one or two weeks there. But actually, I wanted to save Dahab for last, because otherwise I fear I might get ""stuck"" there and spend my whole month there lol.

So my question is this: How can I get from Hurghada to Cairo the cheapest way possible? I have looked into it, but couldn't find any options.

&gt; I know about Go-Bus. But is it possible to catch so-called local buses in Egypt, where you just show up at the bus station and get on the next bus to anywhere? Like it works in India, for example...

I don't want to take any flights.

Also, can you recommend any other places worth seeing in Egypt? I want to avoid resort towns like Sharm. I am interested in Ancient Egyptian History, Islamic history, laid-back places like Dahab...

I am 21, male, from the EU, I have been to countries such as India and Pakistan before, so I know my way around touts, pushy vendors, shitty buses etc.

* Generally more interested in cultural things (museums, food, attractions) than hiking, camping, etc.

Pretty standard I think. I flew over at the beginning of February and spent about a month there before COVID shut everything down and I decided to play it safe and come back home. Covid completely shut down my industry (live entertainment) so I've been here for the past few months working customer service jobs and whatnot to try and get some savings back but I feel like I'm kind of just wasting time at the moment, waiting for things to open back up (who isn't though). I'm also having a hard time letting the visa go to waste so I've been thinking of heading back in January/February and trying to make a go of it again for a few months at least or until things start to hopefully open up back home. 

So despite Covid I'm curious if anyone here has any suggestions about things to do or places to see in a Covid uk, considering I imagine most things will remain closed for the majority of this year or until a vaccine becomes more widespread. Big fan of the outdoors and just looking to explore and take in as much culture as I can given the situation. I'll likely start around London but from there who knows, I'm open to going wherever.

I understand this may come off as a bit tone-deaf/privileged given everything going on in the world at the moment but I'm just trying to make the best sense out of my situation and options.

USEFUL TIP WHILE PLANNING A SAFARI TO TANZANIA,"Just thought I could share with youse this information.

One the things you need to know while planning your safari to Tanzania, East Africa is ""Time to travel""

Here is the months breakdown which I thought could be helpful for someone to decide when to travel.

Tanzania Seasons: 

January to February: It is normally dry and hot. It is the calving season for the wildebeests so the  wildebeests will be at Southern part of Serengeti,  Ndutu area. Though February is the only time of the year which is guranteed to see the big herds all together move to South of Serengeti for calving. 
Easier to spot wildlife. 
Good time for birds watching since migratory birds are present.

March, April &amp; May, this is peak of wet season. Grasses becomes green and beautiful. Rains may interfere your trip,  parks are less crowded, low rates applies. Animals including the wildebeests which are famous for migration are more dispersed.

June: It is a transitional period from rain season to dry season. Grassess become green. The wildebeets start moving from Central to North Serengeti. Migration can be seen in the Western corridor of Serengeti until July.

July to October: It is dry season in Tanzania, Mostly sunny. Morning and nights get cold. From August to Sept the great heards of wildebeests and Zebras move from Northern Serengeti to Maasai Mara by crossing Mara River,  Easy to spot animals because grasses will be grazed by hebivores and also most of animals concentrates around waterholes. It is quite crowded around Seronera area in Serengeti. High season rates applies.

November to December: It is short rain season though it is still not bad to come. The grasses becomes green and beautiful.

All in all, there is no bad time to visit Tanzania, Africa beacause each month has it's own uniqueness.",solotravel,glory1812
Being Realistic,"Alright, hear me out, this might be a strange one.

Ever since I've (20f) been 16 and watched Karl Watson's HK2NY, a bit of a desire to start travelling has morphed into a true, full-blown obsession. I've done a mass interrailing trip when I finished school, went around Italy for 3 weeks last year and had planned for Greece this summer but obviously, that didn't go ahead. Anyways this obsession has been completely tempted by fate due to me being a planner so last Christmas I had started planning a trip for 2022 - commencing 20th July to hit the Banana Pancake Trail, Oceania and finishing off in the US with Hawaii, San Fran and LA.

When I tell you I've planned it - I have planned it to an inch of its life (yes, I understand the appeal to not booking things for after a month of the travel you have planned but I mean to go to quite a few events before I hit Bondi Beach on Christmas Day so I have to keep to a schedule in order to do the things I want to do) so I know where I'm going, the dates I'll be there, how I'm getting there, how much it would be to get there, the hostel I'm staying at, how much the hostel would be per night and per stay with a few activities thrown in and what visa sort documents I need to enter every country.

When girls say all they wanna do is marry and have babies, this trip for around 10-11 months is all I want to do - and it's all I need to do as well. However, in this context of COVID-19, I'm trying to remain optimistic but how hopeful would a trip like this be?

Leaving July 2022 and hitting Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and the US.

Would this trip be viable to happen then (we're talking about with all the events going full blast as well, Full Moon Party, Christmas and NYE on Bondi etc.) or will I have to postpone it by a year?

Should I quit my job and travel for a bit after COVID?,"Hi everyone, a bit about me, I am a 26F from the US. I am currently working as an accountant in the federal government level, which means my job is BORINGGGGG and I am craving some excitement out of my life. I just bought my own home and own my car(no car payments). I recently had a whole change of personal life, where I had my heart broken by my ex fiancé and now kind of want to do what I’ve always wanted to do without having someone hold me back and that’s travel for more than just a few weeks. I would like to do it for 3+ months, even a year if I could. I do make decent money, 60k a year and have a really great job. However, I feel like because I don’t have any kids, and am young still, this is the time to do it. I’ve always wanted to but growing up in poverty I’ve always wanted to be stable as well and I’m scared that if I do this, I’ll regress. However, this has always been a dream of mine and I kind of want to bite the bullet. Especially right now with covid, I’ll be able to save up for it and plan it well. I was just wondering if anyone else has done this and had success or the opposite? For my house I’m thinking of just renting it out for a year through property management (I’ve done this before with an investment property). Any advice would be appreciated!

UPDATE: Thank you for all your words and advice everyone! This is honestly the best subreddit I’ve ever posted in. Now another question! Where would I be able to go travel/backpack as a solo female?",solotravel,tot-and-beans
Spent a month traveling the western US with my dog Kingston- Itinerary,"Back in September I asked about secret spots and great backcountry camping sites west of the Mississippi. I’ve got a post trip update of what happened and where I went! [Photos!](https://imgur.com/gallery/xCmmNRF)

Days 1-3 Holly Springs NF, Mississippi

I left home in Indiana to drive straight south to Mississippi, after stopping off at bass pro in Nashville for last minute things. Muggy, buggy, beautiful. Couldn’t light a fire for the life of me with how wet and wild the wood was. Surprised we didn’t end up with ticks after 3 days there, but we spent time hiking along cotton fields and plenty of small lakes. 

Day 4 Driving across Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas

Spent the night along a truck pull off just east of the NM border

Days 5-10 Carson National Forest NM

I only planned for 3 days in Carson, but the landscape kept me there for 5. I stayed in the Valle Vidal region the entire time, hiking to a new spot every night. I was drastically unprepared for how cold the mountains could get but we survived with a few extra layers at night (I forgot to take a pic of Kingston in a sweatshirt but rest assured he was warm and goofy looking). We were surrounded by cattle and elk most of the time, great bear prevention I’m sure. Trout streams popped here and there, and with my trusty fishing license and collapsible pole we had trout for dinner once which was messy and a pain but so delicious. 

Day 11 Driving to Painted Desert, AZ

Spent the night in my car at the Painted Desert after watching the sun go down across the canyon. Dinner was couscous on the gas stove followed by a treacherous walk along the rim taking photos and warning Kingston to not jump into the void for a stick.

Day 12 Driving to the Chaco Canyon

We (I) needed a shower so we stayed in the local Motel 6. 

Day 13 Chaco Canyon and driving to the Grand Canyon
 
Chaco Canyon was mostly closed trail wise but we were able to walk to the archaeological site to see the Petroglyphs and remains of civilization. Continued on to the Grand Canyon where I didn’t have the foresight to request a back country camping permit 6 months in advance so yet another motel 6 in my favorite city so far, Flagstaff!

Night 13 Flagstaff

I am in love with this city. Nestled between two national forests with a bustling night life, it is everything I have dreamed of in terms of settling down. Stopped by 3 different dog friendly breweries, Wanderlust Brewing Co, Hops on Birch, and Mother Load Brewing Co. All three were dog friendly and had incredible brews.

Day 14-15 The Grand Canyon

We spent two days hiking the trails in the Grand Canyon, day one we hiked the south rim and Bright Angel Point. Day two we hiked the Hermit trail to both Santa Maria Spring and Dripping Springs. Beautiful hikes, very steep, and little water. Kingston was a rockstar and carried his own water in his backpack, he deserved the second bed at the motel after both nights. 

Day 16-19 San Juan NF CO (Durango)

San Juan NF was lush and green. We camped for 3 days between Madden Peak, Baldy Peak, and Silver Mountain. The campgrounds were packed tight but we were able to find a secluded point with only a few neighbors. 

Day 20-22 Bonneville Salt Flats and Antelope Island SP, UT

We spent two nights on the salt flats watching motocross and dune buggies in the Knolls recreation area. Before leaving the next day we drove across the GSL to Antelope Island to check out the “water” and saw a few Buffalo and a lot of brine shrimp/salt flies. 

Day 23-25 Teton NF Wyoming

We saw a few key spots in Teton, hiking around Jenny Lake was the precipice. 

Days 26-30 Yellowstone NP, Wyoming

I needed to check this off my bucket list, walked along the Upper Geyser Basin, saw the Mammoth Hot Springs, Fountain Paint Pot, the Grand Prismatic Spring, Old Faithful, and the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. We hiked the Mud Volcano Trail, Waipiti Lake Trailhead, and Seven Mile Hole Trailhead. We were lucky to find a spot to camp within Yellowstone and reserved it for the 3 nights it took to see as much as possible.

After Yellowstone, we drove back home to Indiana through South Dakota, seeing Mount Rushmore, Minnesota and Wisconsin, stopping at a few creameries for cheese and ice cream, and drove straight through Illinois to home. It was an adventure I’d love to do again, and it’s spurred my interest in Van Life and Tiny Home living.",solotravel,georampage

Dealing with loneliness while traveling,"So I have been in Costa Rica solo traveling for about a month now, and the feeling of loneliness is really starting to creep in. I am enjoying the trip and there is nowhere else I would rather be for the next 6 months, but i am finding making friends to be really difficult. I have lived in Costa Rica before when I was little, and I had plenty of friends. But when you are a kid making friends is as easy as just having toys and being a similar age. Now I am 18 and I am finding it very difficult to connect with anyone. The local girls (ticas) are not a fond of white girls, so I am having a hard time meeting girls my age. The boys here (ticos) are very pushy and pretty much are only looking for romance because the stereotype is white girls are rich and easy. I am going to be living predominately in the same town for the 6 months, so I am hoping to make a little bit of a community. But the community is very tight and very cliquey. There are the resort owners, surfers, hippies, expats and the Costa Rican locals, but I don't fit into any of them. So I am just wondering how you guys have dealt with loneliness while traveling before? And if you have any tips on how to speed up the friend making process?",solotravel,emily_adams123

Need advice about touring the West Coast/South West in US,"Hi,

To give some background about myself: I am a brown guy in his late 20s that has been living in the United States for more than 5 years now. Using a throwaway account because my some people irl know what my primary reddit account is and I do not want them reading this post.

Due to the culture and the very abusive environment that I was brought up in, I have never been able to have a lot of meaningful relationships, not in my native country and not since I have moved to the United States, which means that I like to travel alone and I mostly keep to myself. You maybe wondering what that has to do with my post on this sub, but I'm getting to it.

One of the very few people that I can say that truly always had my best interests at their heart and have always supported me to the best of their abilities (and financially supported me when I had to move to the US) lives back in my native country. That person is going through some pretty serious health issues right now and they need someone to support them. I couldn't just leave them to their devices in these tough times, so I have made the very hard decision to move back home to support them. I have already put in my notice at my current job (which ends in 3 weeks), and since I am here on an employment based Visa right now, I have 2 months to leave the US and would ideally like to leave around the New year's day.

I have spent most of my time in the United States working and traveling in the South and the East Coast and I feel that I have explored as many places as I could in these parts of the US, so there are no regrets there. But one significant regret I have is that I've never really had the chance to  explore much of the west coast or the South West (besides a trip to Vegas where I unfortunately spent most of my time on the strip in the Casinos), so I would really like to visit these places before the end of this year. My budget is up to $7000 (for motels and rental cars) but I am not entirely sure on what places I should visit and where I should start and end my trip and where I would stay if I were to make this trip (and how suitable the weather conditions are). I've always found the pics with nothing but the desert on both sides of the road in Nevada and Arizona highly fascinating and have always wanted to drive around on those roads. I also have a motorcycle license and would love to ride on those roads but I am not sure if it is as easy to get a motorcycle rental as it is to get a car rental (and how safe/expensive it would be).

Assuming that I have 4 days off for the Thanksgiving weekend and 3 weeks between the 11th of December - 1st of January, what places would you recommend if I want to travel the West coast and the South West alone? I have heard that the drive from Oregon - California is very beautiful and is adjacent to a beach, so I would like to cover too that if possible. I would also like to make a trip to the Grand Canyon but I don't know if this is the right season for that. I am feeling even more clueless than I would have in normal times due to the pandemic and the potential lockdown in California. So any advice you would have for me that would help me in doing one or more of the following things would be highly appreciated.

1. Ride a Motorcycle/Drive a Car around in Nevada/Arizona desert area
2. Make the beautiful drive from Oregon - California
3. Visit the Grand Canyon
4. Stops at any other national parks/places with amazing views

I apologize for any incorrect assumptions I made in this post. I have mostly relied upon what people have told me and what I found on some blogs to form my opinion about the places I mentioned above, so I could be wrong in some cases. I am not sure if I will get the chance to visit the United States again, so I would like to make the most of what little time I have left here and visit as much of the western part of this country as I can before I leave. Thank you for taking the time to read this far into the post :)

Edit: Thank you very much to everyone who responded. I’ve had a crazy week and didn’t have the time to respond but I really appreciate all the info that I gathered from the answers. Have a great holiday season all!",solotravel,ofcourse_throwaway1
Advice &amp; information for Camino de Santiago pilgrimage,"Hello everyone,

In this post I'm asking your help preparing for my first long term solo travel, as the title says, on the pilgrimage called Camino de Santiago.

I'm searching for information about the pilgrimage, what to bring, what is useful, what is less useful and any other kind of tips, tricks, etc.

I'm planning to go around april-may (if the COVID situation permits) and until then I wish to buy more equipment (I have a bivy sack but I think I'll go for a one person tent for example), so please, if anyone has any tips for the pilgrimage and on solo travelling as well, I'm really eager and thankful to read it.

Any resource and information about equipment, roads, maps, websites, etc. is welcome as well.

"If you were a betting redditor, based off of everything we know with the incoming vaccines, how long it could take for global immunity (enough for travel to be safe again anyway), when would you guess that we'll be able to safely and freely solo travel again?","*tl;dr The title, essentially*

I wanted to discuss with fellow solo travelers who I feel must've had this thought come up. 

Last year I graduated and got a job in January that comes with 2 weeks (80 hours) PTO. As a result I immediately started to plan my next trip for March-April 2021 so I could revisit Japan (and a few other countries) during cherry blossom season. Then Covid hit and destroyed that dream, however I still want to travel the moment Covid is a thing in the past. I'm so starved for traveling that I started willingly started working extra hours during certain holidays (Like Indigenous Peoples' Day) when we would otherwise have off to acquire comp time so I could have 3-3.5 weeks of vacation when Covid ends and really make up for lost time.

Now here's where the question comes from. My job doesn't let me rollover PTO, so as a result I need to take some soon. I made an excel sheet where I put in a planned date to determine how many PTO hours I can use prior to that date to avoid not accumulating PTO but still reach max PTO by the time it's travel time. Example, if I take off 2 days in December, I will max back out around April, and 4 days means I'll max back out in June. Give or take.

As a result I've been doing some kind of pre-planning and guessing on when travel will be back to normal. As wishful thinking as it would be, I don't think March-April would be back to normal (which saddens me as I really want to see the cherry blossoms, but I'm also a hypochondriac so it wouldn't even be a fun trip for that reason), so I currently have put June as my more somewhat realistic date. Of course if that doesn't appear to be the case, I'll just adjust accordingly in regards to my PTO and such.

With that in mind, if you were to make a guess, what month (god forbid year) would you think the world would be ready for risk-free travel again? I'm just curious on what other solo travelers specifically think, because I feel like y'all may better understand the reasons why I'm so starved to travel again. Doing whatever I want, getting away from it all, making new friends, with no responsibility for anyone else but yourself. You could say I'm having withdrawals. My friends generally travel with family and other friends so they don't really understand the sense of pure freedom that I miss so much. 

Thanks in advance!",solotravel,LethalCS
First Solo Trip - Across the US,"Hey guys! I’m (22 F) sure a question along this vein has been asked before, but I wanted to get other people’s opinions. I’m graduating this December and I am planning on moving to Berlin next August for my masters. This gives me a pretty large amount of free time. I’ve saved up quite a bit of money, and wanted to do a road trip across the US before I leave. I don’t have anyone that could really do it with me, and I plan on probably sleeping in my car for a lot of it (my back windows are tinted in my Honda CRV). My dad is very against it, is saying that a lot of things could go wrong. I’ve traveled a lot around the world but usually with said dad, and I’ve never done a trip by myself. There are so many things I want to see before I leave, and although I’m quite independent, I have never had to deal with things that can go wrong on the road (like car trouble, etc).

I know you can exchange cash at the airport, but I would rather not carry a huge amount of cash on me for safety reasons. I have read that visa cards are the most widely accepted in Ghana. Does that mean I can just buy like the $100 prepaid visa cards that you can find in Walmart and use that? Again, I feel like I sound totally dumb, but I really don't understand how this works.

Solo Travelled Brazil (Oct-Nov 2020),"I went on a 2 Week Trip to Brazil from the US from late October and early November. I plan on describing my experience, tips, how I did concerning security, COVID, my hostel experience, and any other relevant information.

Background information on myself so you can get an idea of who I am:

\- Male, 28 years old, average build but with a NY-resting bitch face and walking speed/gait so I can at times dissuade randoms from talking to me. I have solo travelled previously. FIRST TIME to Brazil and South America

\- English: Native / Spanish: Native / Portuguese: Intermediate-High (obvious accent)

\- Brazil Solo Travel Requirement: I'd say Intermediate-Easy. If you've solo'd to Mexico, Turkey or Egypt, you're more than ready. 

Quick Notes for the TL;DR crew:

\- Would I recommend: Yes. Very much so. Highly recommend. 

\- Currency Conversion: Very good, USD is strong.

\- Places visited: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro

\- COVID: Everywhere I went people were very cautious of their surroundings, nearly everyone used a mask, social distancing was hard in some locations but for the most part noticeable measures were taken. Unfortunately, much like most of Latin America, COVID and its outbreaks is highly correlated with one's socioeconomic status.

\- Safety: I personally believe everything I read previously on reddit and other places were exaggerated. This is not to say that you shouldn’t take the smart skills and tips provided to make the informed and preventative measures. I always placed my iPhone 11 Max Pro (whatever it's called) in my front pocket, or my small should fanny pack thing, always had my money clip in front pocket too. (Regardless of travelling or not, you should always keep your wallet in your front pocket). 

I personally never saw anyone get mugged, or felt threatened; I did see some sketchy teens near the historical areas in São Paulo, but you can spot them from afar and they just give off a vibe that they're up to no good. They're not violent though, they're just skulking around, some are clearly high.  Just keep your eyes peeled for anything sus and always look far ahead to prevent anything, and look like you know where you're going and doing. They know when people aren't from there, but if you look unbothered and stern they won't even approach you. It's a bit easier to keep your distance from people due to COVID. If someone does come up and tries to pitch you a sale or something just politely extend your arm and say ""não obrigado"" (no thanks). 

In Rio I took my phone to the beach despite everyone's caution. I never took it out around the bike lanes, however you can see other Brazilians and locals jog up and down the bike lanes with their lastest phones, airpods and other gadgets. I didn't want to tempt that. I would only take my phone out on the shoreline, always after checking my surroundings. If you get a beach seat and beach umbrella from those beach vendors then you can near-worry-free use your phone and take all the selfies you want. I went to the beach with random hostel people (all Brazilians) and we had no issue whatsoever. We would take turns keeping watch on our stuff. We did ask a large group next to us if they could keep an eye on our stuff, they were very willing and even suggested we move our things into the middle of their friend circle so they could properly watch it. 

&amp;#x200B;

São Paulo: I did all the major touristy things from wikitravel, youtube videos, and random blogs.

\- Hostel: Brazilodge Hostel and Hotel in Vila Mariana. Clean hostel, nice staff. Due to COVID many young Brazilian professionals come and go through there, met many recently graduated professionals. Brazilians are very kind and intrigued to meet new people and especially foreigners. This is an upper middle class neighborhood, very clean, very safe. You can see young ladies walk and talk on their phones without worry, teens biking around with their iWatches, and people at night without a worry. 

\- Metro: Extremely efficient, clean, and very safe. The moment people pass the turnstiles people use their phones without a care in the world, on the platform and on the train itself. If you've been to NY, London or Paris than mastering this metro system will take about a whole 10 minutes. I never used the bus, mostly because I hate busses and also because of COVID. 

\- Tinder: Safe, never met anyone sus or trying to scam you. Love motels in Brazil are amazing. $50 for 12 hours gets you a pool, jacuzzi, waterfall shower and a free meal.

\- Uber: Safe, everyone I met was 4.85+ rating. They recently implemented new measures to stamp out any creeps and to make solo women feel safer and have easier means to report any scumbags. 

\- Restaurants: HIGHLY RECOMMEND: Rodizio de Sushi, omfg best thing ever. Never had a bad food experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Rio: I did take a bit more security measures as most people kept saying it was more dangerous. Honestly the Ipanema area is very safe, much safer than Copacabana in my opinion, but even then I didn't feel like people were being robbed and kidnapped at every corner. Walked around with my phone in my pocket and used it freely inside stores, restaurants and cautiously on the street. 

\- Hostel: Mango Tree Hostel. Toilets and showers could be cleaner, but it's worth the money. Great place to meet other travellers, friendly people, lots of locals, good amount of foreigners despite COVID. The very few other foreigners were also versed travellers. 

\- Beach: Ipanema beach is much better than Copacabana, fewer people, less beach vendors, less randos and sus people. All the beach vendors that do approach are polite and aren't harassing, they just quickly pitch their sale and if you politely say 'no thanks' or look but say you're no interested in the moment they'll be on their way. Don't be dick, they're people just trying to make a living. Be nice to them, they're nice to you so it's the least you can do. Some actually have good stuff. The beach seats and umbrella are about R$30 for both for unlimited amount of time. Settle on price prior to sitting. 

Public Transport: I didn't ride any, the uber's were cheap enough, I did walk around with another American aimlessly throughout the southern part of Rio, no problem whatsoever, pretty chill. 

Safety: I felt as though it was ever so slightly more dodgy than São Paulo but nothing like the fear-mongering that many other places would describe it as. I took my phone everywhere, to the beach, the streets, on the ubers, to the tourist attractions, etc. 

I dislike Copacabana, 100% preferred Ipanema beach, the vibe is different more welcoming less commercial, less tourist trap, more authentic. Also on Ipanema the vendors are more laid back and slightly cheaper. All of Rio is gay friendly, but Ipanema has a ""spot"" for LBGT+ people, they may ask you to watch their stuff, it's kind of rule of thumb to watch other people's stuff as they'll watch your stuff too if you ask, scratch my back I'll scratch yours type of thing. I also felt safer taking my phone our and taking photos on Ipanema. It's more of a gut feeling, and never ignore your gut.

Tinder: A bit more shallow people, but just as safe. Good food, people are always nice too.

Summary: I would definitely go again, thoroughly enjoyed my time, didn't have a single issue, met tons of people, great sushi.",solotravel,Marco_Tarik92

Help with SEA Itinerary,"Hello everyone! 

The only thing keeping me sane lately is diving into planning trips and one that I've really, really been looking forward to is Southeast Asia. I know this is a great place for solo backpackers to embark on first-time longer trips, so want to travel there first! I've done solo trips but my longest is only three months, with a friend joining me for the last month, and I'm hoping to spend 4 to 5 months in SEA. Below is my rough itinerary, in the order that I would be doing the travelling. 

Thailand: Bangkok - Sukhothai - Chang Mai (&amp; Mae Hong Loop)

Myanmar: Bagan, Inle Lake, Shwedagon Pagoda, Golden Rock

Back into Thailand: Pai &amp; Chiang Rai

Laos: Luang Prabang - Nong Khiaw - Muang Ngoi - Vang Vieng - Vientiane

Vietnam: Hanoi - Sapa - Ha Long Bay - Optional Adventure: The Ha Giang Loop – 3 Days - Phong Nha National Park - Hue - Hoi An - Dalat - Mui Ne - Ho Chi Minh City

Cambodia: Phnom Penh - Kep - Kampot - Koh Rong - Siem Reap 

Southern Thailand: Bangkok - Surat Thani -  Kho Phangan - Koh Tao - Khao Sok National Park - Krabi- Phi Phi Islands - Railay and Ton Sai - Koh Lipe

Malaysia: Langkawi - Penang - Taman Negara - Cameron highlands - Kuala Lumpur 

Singapore (only 2-3 days here)

Indonesia: Bali, Mount Bromo, Borneo, Komodo Islands, Sumatra, Lombok 

**My main questions are:** Would you add or leave out anything from this itinerary? How long do you think it'll take to do this realistically? (I'm a medium-paced traveler, I can stay in some places for 3 days and others for a week if I really like them, so it usually balances out). How much would you budget for this kind of trip?

Any suggestions for a 3 month long trip? Can I do Europe and SEA in that time?,"Hi guys. Assuming the pandemic is a thing of the past by May 2021 (I know it's not a given but let's assume it is for the purposes of this), I'm looking to do a big trip since I'm graduating college and don't start my job until August or September (my choice). 

I want to do an epic adventure, but I'm not sure where to begin. I really want to explore all of Europe (especially eastern europe) as well as southeast Asia. I want to live in hostels, party, eat good food, and meet cool people, but I'm also really interested in hiking at some unique places.

I'm constantly traveling and exploring and things that wow most people don't seem to wow me. It's like I'm disappointed.

Question about tourist visas to Ireland,"I have no idea if this is a good place to ask this question or not, but i figured someone will probably know.

Off to Colombia on a solo trip next week - any last-minute tips?,"I'm flying to Cartagena, Colombia next Saturday. Will be spending 7(ish) weeks in Colombia. First time in South America so I'm very excited. I have a rough itinerary below...

* Cartagena (3 nights)
* Santa Marta (4 nights)
* Lost City trek (4 nights)
* Palomino (3 nights)
* Minca (4 nights)
* Bogota (3 nights)
* Salento (3 nights)
* Medellin (6 nights) (With some time spent in Guatape)
* Pereira (3 nights)
* Cali (4 nights)

After that, I either plan on staying in Colombia for the final two weeks of the trip or potentially heading to Dominican Republic. See what happens! I've not booked anything yet (bar 2 nights in Cartagena) so this is an extremely rough plan. I've also looked at going to San Andres y Providencia but the horrendous events of the past week there (Hurricane Iota) make that increasingly unlikely...

I'm thinking about possibly spending a bit more time near the Caribbean coast (Tayrona NP) but that would mean a bit less time further South. Any suggestions?",solotravel,swingingpendulums

Where are you travelling for Christmas break?,"I'm doing 3 weeks in Mexico. I'm visiting a lot of family and spending a few solo days in Mexico City. I did an amazing solo 34 days in Mexico last year and fell in love with the country. I have never spent a Christmas in the country though so excited to see how that goes with Covid. Before I get murdered in the comments for traveling during Covid I want to tell yall why I'm choosing to do so. First I want to support Mexicos people by travelling there. I'm young and healthy. Travelling will help my metal health because it makes me happy. Mental health I feel like is being ignored nowadays, when it is so important. Also, Mexico is open for tourism so I am excited to get back to traveling . My last trip was in February to Bordeux, France.

Do you think it is unethical/irresponsible to travel in the covid era?,"My vacation is coming up on November 21st and normally I go to Greece for a month to escape the cold of New Jersey(USA) around this time of the year, but Americans can't travel to Europe. Covid looks like it will last over a year and we have to return to normal life sometime, but by traveling I will likely feel a little guilt. I am thinking of maybe traveling within the USA to warmer areas down South, since I really haven't been around most of the country. 

I travel alone all the time, so it would be easy for me to avoid other people and I am wondering if traveling alone in a hotel room by myself would be less harmful than staying at home with my family?

Backpack Essentials?,"Hi everyone,

My girlfriend is going to China for a year and a half for work, and she had asked for a few things (backpack, travel blanket, etc.).

I want to put this all together as a big Christmas gift. Are there any essentials that are small/lightweight?

I have the backpack, and then inside I have a compact travel blanket, extra iPhone charging cables, a water bottle, a waist strap for the bag, small carry-on-sized bottles, and some organizer bags for her suitcase.

I thought something like a travel quick-drying towel would be useful, and I also thought about water shoes for the beaches,  but I also don't want to fill up her bag with stuff she hasn't specifically asked for and/or won't use. I'm probably going to go with the towel because it's light and can really pack light.

She already has a good size portable charger and two power cubes.

Extended Solo Stay in Mexico,"I was recently told by my company that we won't be going back to the office until at least April 2021. As a result, I've realized that there's nothing stopping me from going somewhere tropical and working off my laptop for a month or two during the winter. While I've done solo travel before, I've never done so for more than about a week, so I'm not overly familiar with the differences in how to plan. Currently, I'm targeting Mexico (probably Playa del Carmen) for a January/February stay.

Could anyone who's familiar with extended solo stays or digital nomad setups provide me with some guidance?

The tickets have dates on them. The flexibility is that I can amend the dates or cancel free of cost. I am trying to find out if there is some fine print somewhere that will screw me.

I have two options for my destination:

Etihad (flexible dates)

Qatar airways (flexible dates)

If something happens which one of these is less likely to screw me? 

I have travelled with Etihad before but it was a simple economy class ticket. Never used flexible plan. Tried to contact their customer support on twitter and I am getting vague answers from Etihad. Qatar airways is not responding.

Edit: looking at their websites, the qatar site seems a lot more flexible where your ticket will be valid for the next two years. Etihad is using confusing language.

Tried to contact their customer support with specific examples and they are giving me vague answers.

Confusing wording on the sites. Qatar seems better but I don't like their timings and the airline

How responsible is it to travel to Southern CA right now?,"My brother wanted me to visit for Thanksgiving, so over the Summer he bought me a flights from NYC to southern CA. He bought me tickets that leave a week before Thanksgiving. Now as things approach I and things are locking down I am getting hesitant. Actually earlier today I decided not to go, but when I did that I realized how much I needed this trip. I cant drive, I live in the city and I LITERALLY have not traveled more than 20 blocks since March. I feel like I am emotionally about to break, and I get a sense that everything is locking down again, and I am genuinely concerned about my mental health over the Winter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the plan I have: I plan to fly on a mostly empty night flight, and NOT stay with my brother, self quarantine at an airbnb for the 14 days (take a Covid test before I leave and a molecular CoVID  test 7 days after my flight for peek accuracy) After that second test is confirmed negative I would do a socially distanced Thanksgiving with him and his wife outside.  After the two weeks are up I would stay with him for another week and then drive up to Northern CA with him (as he needs to drive up to SF) where I then would fly out of SFO.

Some people are like ""DONT LEAVE YOUR HOUSE!!"" and other people like ""don't worry about it I was on a flight last week, its fine!""

Month Long Workation Accommodations: Any feedback?,"As usual, all of this is relative to pandemic status next year. But.

I'm lucky enough to make good money working from home with a flexible enough schedule to do workations. I'm very attracted to the idea of month long jaunts (basically turns 3-5 weeks yearly of travel into several months), and I'm looking to crowd source a few opinions on this.

I know there are serviced apartments you can rent, especially in places like Bangkok (a target of mine) but I really don't think I'd have as much fun holed up in an apartment, whereas I can still meet people in a hostel. Do some of the long-term deals tend to carry over into private rooms in hostels, in anyone's experience? Alternative suggestions that meet in the middle?

This is less of a concern for other itineraries I'm thinking about (something like a week each in Barceona, Madrid, Valencia, and Morocco) because I know hopping around will be involved. On this note, does anyone have experience with 1-2 week hops between cities while doing it vs. choosing a ""home base"", and what were some things that might be worth considering between the two?",solotravel,jtrom1010
"With 14 days (excl travel), do you do Prague + another nearby country or stay in the CR?","Just doing some tentative research for next summer (COVID willing), and strongly considering making Prague the next place I hit for solo travel. I've done years of research and couldn't be more thrilled with the choice.

I'm not the type to hit as many countries as possible just to do it, but 5-7 days in a city (maybe less depending where) is usually enough for me. I have done a big time dive into what to do in the CR and I can't say anything excites me so far. If I'm already out there, I'm leaning towards making it a Prague +Vienna/Budapest/Munich/something like that combo rather than taking my time to explore the rest of the Czech Republic.

I love natural beauty and the small town charm, but I'm always more thrilled by a bit of culture shock, food, nightlife, and interesting architecture/history.

Am I missing out on some big time hidden gems in the Czech Republic? I'm less concerned about the logistics of country hopping than I am potentially robbing myself by writing off the rest of a sizeable nation while I'm there.

**Edit:** Wow guys, thanks so much for all the feedback! Few things:

I've settled on Prague, Budapest, and a 3 day stretch between Vienna and Bratislava in between. How I split that up is TBD, but with that, I can pick and choose how to spend that time and I can do it midweek so I get weekend days in Prague and Budapest both. 

Also, apparently my wording was ambiguous. Prague was never in play for 2 full weeks, my original question was mostly ""should I do this apparently popular country hop"" or really dig into all the CR has to offer? However, nonetheless, all my questions have been answered and I'm more excited now than when I posted. :) ",solotravel,jtrom1010

Solo trip to Canary Islands,"Hi guys! Just wanted to share with you my latest experience in the Canary Islands (Spain).

* **Trip Length**

The trip lasted 14 days broken down in this way: 4 days Tenerife, 4 days Gran Canaria, 5 days Fuerteventura and 1 day Lanzarote. I was hoping to visit the remaining 3 smaller islands but unfortunately I ran our of time. That's a good excuse to come back soon!

* **Covid-19 situation**

I  flew from the UK and there was no quarantine required upon arrival nor negative test certification (I went there in Mid-October so the situation might have changed in the meantime). However, you are required to download and fill an health control form and obtain your QR Code, to show it at the control points upon arrival in Spain. Also, a temperature check is performed at the airport.

All shops/restaurants/bars were open until late in the evening and masks are mandatory both inside and outside. Very few tourists everywhere and hotels/resorts/beaches mostly empty.

* **Logistics**

There are plenty of daily flights from London and I paid £30 only (one-way to Tenerife) with 2 luggages. The price carrying one luggage only was £12! I also flew from Gran Canaria to Fuerteventura, the flight takes approx. 30mins and I paid £20. From Tenerife to Gran Canaria I decided to catch a ferry, the problem is that I booked it only few days in advance and I ended up paying £70 for a 1,40h journey. Lesson learnt for the next time!

Once you arrive, the best way to go around is renting a car.   

You should rent a car at the airport. It’s better reserving the car on [www.rentalcars.com](http://www.rentalcars.com/) where you can find very good deals. Be aware that on top of the price you see on the website, you will need to pay the insurance, which is normally around 50/70£ for 4 days of renting. You could also choose not to pay for the insurance, but then you will have to pay upfront for a deposit of £1,100 (I chose this option in Tenerife and I got my deposit back after one week). Generally,, the roads in Tenerife and Gran Canaria are very good, especially in Tenerife where there is a main highway surrounding the Teide volcano and the traffic is not crazy at all. Fuerteventura is wilder, many roads are not paved so having an insurance is highly recommended. Renting a car is absolutely the best way to explore the island on your own and I would strongly recommend it. Also, fuel is super cheap at approx. 0,8EUR/liter so a full tank for a small car would not cost more than 50 EUR. 

* **Tenerife (Accommodation- What to see)**

I stayed in Playa de las Americas, in the South part of the island. In normal conditions, this would be the party place of the island, with loads of hotels, resorts, bars and restaurants. It’s a very clean and beautiful town, however due to covid, it was literally a ghost town (which I totally didn’t mind as I was somewhere else exploring every single day). Be aware that there are no beaches here (as in the whole island basically), but you could stay in a luxurious 5 star mega-pool resort for 60/70£ a night, like I did. To be honest this was not the best option for me as I've never used the pool or the other facilities of the resort and I could have stayed in a much cheaper place. Another lesson learnt for the next time.

 If you want to experience a more vibrant town, probably you should opt staying in Santa Cruz, the capital, especially if you land in Tenerife North Airport.

1. Teide Volcano and the surrounding National Park- what else?? Absolutely amazing. Plan to stay there a whole day. You can reach 2,500 mt with your own car, then if you want to proceed further, there is a cable car which takes you to 3,500mt. Bring a jacket/jumper with you as the temperature when I climbed was about 5/7 degrees. Tickets to the cable car can be bought online (it costs around 25 EUR). Normally there are long lines but due to the corona I was barely the only person there.

2. Santa Cruz de Tenerife- nice to wander around for few hours, especially if you fancy nice local restaurants. 

3. National Park of Anaga- in the North of the island. You can spend here easily the entire day hiking the spectacular mountains. It’s rather a green area so the landscape is totally different from the Teide National Park. Be aware that the roads are good but being on the slopes of high mountains….it might be a bit overwhelming driving through.

4. Punta de Teno- the most western part of the island, quite difficult to get there. To avoid crowds getting there, the road is closed every day from 10 to 19 and only buses go there in between. There is an amazing lighthouse at the very end of the road which you should reach at sunset to remain astonished by the view. I went there at sunset after 19 with my own car. Absolutely worth it.

5. Vineyards/wine tasting close to Pueblo de la Cruz- Actually didn’t go there but I heard it’s worth a visit- keep this as a back-up plan in case you end up having some spare time.

* **Gran Canaria (Accommodation- What to see)**

I opted for an hotel in Maspalomas, in the South of the island. Paid £50 a night with breakfast included. I could have spent lot less also here, but I wanted to be comfortable.

Gran Canaria in my opinion is the less interesting island I've visited. It's very commercial and apart from the Maspalomas dunes (which are stunning) and some hikes, the other parts of the island are not impressive at all. I spent there 4 days but I suggest cutting to 3 days max.

1. Maspalomas dunes. 

2. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. The capital city. The city center is buzzling- full of cute bars/restaurants 

* **Fuerteventura (Accommodation- What to see)**

In my opinion, the best island in terms of landscapes.   

I stayed in the North, Corralejo. It’s a very cute town with lot of restaurants and bars. The North side of the island is well known for its surfing activities, so you will find a lot of surf houses and a “hippy vibe”.  Highly recommended. You could also opt to stay in the South in Costa Calma, which has amazing beaches but when I went there most of the places/resorts were closed and it lacked some vibe. Not recommended, at least nowadays.

1. Corralejo dunes- it’s a Natural park where you will find real desert dunes and a long beach to relax.

2. El Castillo beaches (especially Playa de los Lagos and Playa de la Concha where you can use your sun cream a lot…)- not far from Corralejo, go there for the best sunset of the whole island. There is a lighthouse and the scenery is very cool, especially because I brought a drone and I got very cool shots.

3. Caldern Horno- it’s a small volcano, you can climb it and get very cool photos

4. Cofete Beach- the most difficult beach to reach- you have to drive a long dirty road but…it was probably the best place I have seen in the whole trip. There is a small cemetery on the sand…if you get there at sunset it’s stunning. Be aware that you cannot swim there (the whole Western coast of Fuerte is not recommended to swim because of the strong sea and winds).

5. Sotavento beach - this is probably the best beach if you want to practice kitesurf/windsurf- it’s like 5km long, yellow fine sand and turquoise water. Amazing.

6. Playa de Esquinzo- the most famous for surfers- it’s on the West side so again not the best to swim, but the scenery is stunning especially at sunset.

7. All the windmills around the island, there are many and you can make cool shots of them.

8. Costa Calma- this is a resort place, so quite empty, but the best beaches are there- strongly recommended if your goals is just to lay under the sun

I spent only few hours in Lanzarote on a day trip from Fuerteventura catching a ferry (price 60£ with the car) so really cannot comment much. However, I managed to drive through the Timanfaya National Park and it looks like a Martian landscape, absolutely unreal.

Recommendations for Southern New Mexico and Arizona,"I have an unexpected 7 or 8 days off coming up in about a week and I'm thinking I'd like to take the time to explore more of Southern New Mexico and possibly some of Southern Arizona.

I'll be driving from Northern Colorado in a capable 4x4 vehicle and plan to camp on Federal land every night.


I haven't spent much time in the Southern portions of those states. For New Mexico, I've been to Carlsbad Cavern and White Sanda (newly designated!) National Park. For Arizona, I've been to Tuscon briefly and Tombstone (regrettable lol). 


So far my only plans are to explore around Lincoln National Forest and Gila National Forest. I still need to do more research but it would be awesome if anyone has any recommendations for beautiful and interesting places to check out in that region of the Southwest.",solotravel,ChickenLickinDiddler
I am in search of interesting countries for a trip next year.,"


Hello fellow travelers.
I want to on interesting trip next year. Since my plans for this year got screwed thanks to Covid. I want it to be something that i remember a long time and i don’t have regret in the aftermath. You will find more informations below.

I am from Germany.  I already did a bicycle tour from Switzerland to Berlin. Most of my other trips were basically sightseeing holidays. My only adventure trip until now was in norway for two weeks.

I already visited following countries:

-Austria
-Switzerland 
-France
-Italy (5-times)
-Spain (2-times)
-England
-Norway
-Belgium
-Netherlands

Countries which would interest me:

-Ireland
-Singapore
-South Korea
-Sri Lanka
-Australia 
-New Zealand

Length: Between 3 -6 weeks (June to august)

Budget: Enough to afford six weeks sightseeing, accommodation, flights and so on

Interests:

-Culture and food 
-Great and memorable views 
-Meeting interesting people 

Kind of trip I want:
I honestly enjoy both adventure trips and sightseeing trips. 


I am open to suggestions regarding other countries as well. My preference lies outside of Europe. As mentioned above i want it to be a trip which memories I can share with friends and family. Leaving my own comfort zone and journey through other countries before i start my own family is one of my biggest aims. I don’t want to regret my decision in a few years from now.

Thanks for all your suggestions in advance. Stay safe.",solotravel,Black-Maria-one-piec
"Adjusting to ""Normal Life""","Hey y'all, I'm hoping to hear back from some long term travelers, who no longer travel so much. 

I'm sure most solo travelers, especially long term travelers, understand me when I talk about how easy it is to make connections with people while on the road. You go to a hostel, there's a person sitting at a table, you can basically walk up to them, strike a conversation about deep personal things, and within 30 minutes, you and this person feel like you've known each other your whole lives, and are now planning to hitchhike together to the nearest rainbow gathering sleeping under trees in the same tent because there is a sense of trust. 

Countless times this happens in different variations, it is CRAZY how many people I found myself thinking ""holy shit, we could actually be best friends wtf"" because of how personal the conversations were, how loving and accepting and trusting people are while on the road. Same with couchsurfing, and hitchhiking, and volunteering, etc etc etc. 

Now to present day. I'm starting a seasonal job in the US, it's my first official, legal job where I will have roots for the next 6 months. And I am trying to make friends here. 

But damn. It has not been easy for me. I'm so used to this instant vulnerability with people, and I'm so used to just opening up basically immediately to people because of how common place it always has been while moving around, but I don't think that non-traveling people respond very well to this sort of instant interaction. I think I might actually frighten them away? 

My feeling is that it's seen as suspicious. So, I guess what I'm asking is, how the hell do I make friends with people in a stable or regular sort of life? The travel way isn't working, so I'm not entirely sure. 

Tips for readjusting are appreciated!",solotravel,kittenklyn

"How to travel with others when solo travel is much preferred, finding balance","How does one plan a hybrid trip with others when the plans change completely, and go in a different direction than even alternative preferences due to schedule or budget limitations that are not shared?

I have been speaking with some friends about a trip for some time now but the plan has changed from the original idea due to a combination of Covid fears, budget and schedule. I feel bad bailing as we've been talking about this for a while, but our first choice and my alternative preference have both been decided against for a third place which I don't really care for ATM as the main draw is not in active season and there is not much culinary excitement which is my primary interest. 

The others want to travel just to go ""anywhere but here"" but I am a little more deliberate with my travel. That being said, I find myself at times wanting to be flexible and go on group trips just to go on a group trip but I am finding it difficult to commit, also because of fear of being the odd guy out and go against the flow since I prefer solo travel or travel with specific friends that I know we can align well.

There is still opportunity for me to go solo to my alternative beforehand and meet up with the group at their choice not too far away but the itinerary they are planning is fitting a lot into a short period of time. If I were to arrive after to shorten my participation, it could be difficult to join up with the others physically, and/or align energy-wise.

I am having a hard time finding the flexibility within me to join. But I feel bad bailing despite having fair reasons. 

Fellow solo travelers, how do you make hybrid trips like this work? Should I be more flexible, visit my alternate choice and meet up after and go along for the ride or do I call that it has gone too far in a different direction and just politely decline? If I were to go all that way to my alternate and not join with the others at their nearby choice, it probably would not be well perceived. So it seems to be coming down to an all-or-nothing.

I have only traveled international twice. Both times to Japan. I went solo to japan last year. I want to go again but have mixed feelings about my experience going alone,"I have been to japan twice. 

- Once with a group of 5 friends for two weeks, We went all around japan (Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fuji, Kyoto)
- Once solo for two weeks (I just stayed in Tokyo and didnt do any day trips for two weeks)

The first time I went was interesting. I enjoyed being with my friends but most nights we all wanted to do different things, all had different budgets and regardless of what we did one person wasn't satisfied with what we did. Overall I did enjoy it though as it was much better with friends

The 2nd time I went, Was solo. I liked this a lot more as I got to see and do whatever I wanted without having to worry what my friends did, This was okay for the first week however towards the end of my trip I did feel rather lonely as I hadn't really made any friends and the majority of things I did was all solo.

Im fairly introverted. I tried using meetup/air bnb events to make things interesting but ultimately I got bored very quickly. It also probably didnt help that I chose to stay in Tokyo for the whole two weeks and I ended up just going to arcades everyday for the last 3 or 4 days of my trip. This trip was incredibly low budget, I stayed in hostels and ate cheap food as I thought it would be more wise to spend money on activities and experiences rather than food.

Anyhow. I want to go back again next year for the 3rd time. It most likely will be solo again as my close friend circle are relatively poor with money and spending and they wont be willing to spend a few thousand dollars traveling.

What were some of the things you do when solo traveling to enjoy yourself more?

Thanks!",solotravel,spazzo246

How do you manage work vs. travel?,"I’m a 22 year old dude and have been working full-time for about the last 2+ years. I’ve been overseas twice, but both times with my family and siblings when I was younger - New Zealand when I was like 14 and the US when I was 17. 

Now that I’m working full time, I guess I’m wondering how most of you manage work and travelling? I really don’t want to live with regrets, I already am worried about wasting my youth and getting stuck, and I’m really interested in travelling so I really want to solo travel/travel with friends while I’m young. (Not that you can’t do it when you’re older, but I guess it would be a little different)

Do most of you just travel in your annual leave/vacation time? Do you get a new job and travel when you’re between jobs? Do you take unpaid leave? Do you quit without something else lined up and just worry about it when you get back?

I’m fortunate that I still live at home currently, with very low expenses so it would be easier for me to just quit, but I’m still wondering about what all of you amazing people do. I may move out over the next year or two. And want to travel once we get through this whole pandemic thing 

I don’t know what it’s called, but I’ve heard of people who try to work a couple of years and save, then travel for a bit and repeat, which sounds cool.

Anyway - let me know what you do, any advice, and if there’s any good resources I should check out. It would really help me out :) thank you!",solotravel,BiriusSlack_

Need a home base for 3-4 months in southern hemisphere for winter to escape SAD. Thinking Brazil/Chile/???,"Looking to move from NY to somewhere in South Hemisphere from January 1 -&gt; April 2020.

Unfortunately there’s no way I can work remotely working at a Grocery Outlet (If I’m not allowed to put the name I will edit and fix this) unless  someone else knows something I don’t about remote work for them, I’ve looked around but haven’t found anything.

My “plan” was to buy a laptop, get an online job, buy a van or something, build a nice interior to sleep, cool, etc. and get solar panels for charging. But, there’s multiple ways I can go about this, just don’t know the best one.

1. Go to college.
If needed, I could go to college for some kind of e-commerce, or computer science. (I know Python, and I absolutely love computers. I’ve been in love with programming, building them, etc for years.)

2. Get a contract for an at sea processor.
I could go out to sea and process seafood and make $16 - $27/hr with 16 hour days, 7 days a week, and for 65 - 90+ days. I could go out to sea, come back with like $19k and then leave to travel. 

3. Become a Digital Nomad.
I could use a combo of a college degree and score a nice online job, buy a laptop (I have a pc at my parents home to work on atm) and then fly to Chiang Mai, or somewhere, I don’t know.

Covid Flights - Refund or Credit?,"I booked a flight for a friends wedding in Spain, NYC to Spain round trip. In June, a week before the flight, AirCanada changed my dates and had me flying out of Germany on the way back.. so they essentially cancelled my flight as there was no way I’d be on the flights with covid and no way I’d even be able to cross the European borders at that time.

I tried to demand a refund but best they are offering is credit for future flights.. My credit card won’t accept disputes over the phone and has ignore my written request for refund.

Recommendations for Colombia?,"Hi guys, I'm putting together a little solo trip (most likely in January 2021), and I would greatly appreciate some advice.

For background, I'm a 24 year old black guy from the US (Minnesota specifically).  This isn't my first solo trip, but it is my first to a Spanish-speaking country, so I've been on Duolingo quite a bit lately.

I'm looking at 3-4 nights each for Bogota, Medellin, and Cartagena in that order, and for hostels I'm considering the Cranky Croc Hostel, the Black Sheep, and El Viajero respectively.  My budget is roughly $1500 including flights, so it should work I think.

My main interests are history (especially political and military history) and looking at graffiti, architecture, and stuff like that in cities.  You guys have any recommendations for that and for restaurants as well?  Or any other tips about Colombia in general?

Thanks!",solotravel,TheAmericanski
Weirdest people you've met while travelling?,"I'll start. Sorry in advanced for the long post. It's a doozy, but I'll try to keep it as concise as possible.

tl;dr: I (25M) met and spent an evening with a drunk, creepy middle aged dude from Dubai who borderline tried to be my sugar daddy and set me up with his 13 year old daughter back at home, and got upset when I got the fuck outta there.

I was in Phnom Penh by myself at a night market and I met a middle aged man from Dubai at an ice cream stall, also alone. He seemed friendly, his english was okay, so we talked for a bit and I kindly said goodbye.

I bumped into him again on the street. He insisted he buy me a beer. Sure why not, and I buy him a round to return the favour. He continues trying to buy me beer throughout the night, but I know my limit and won't get pressured to go past it. I get up to a buzz (3 or 4 beers in) and say no more, which he gets slightly upset about.

Throughout the night he would point to young local women around us and give me a creepy smile and laugh. He talked about how the prostitute he hired in Thailand stole his money, and how he has to pay for sex but it's free for me because I'm young. He says if I ever came to Dubai he'd pay for everything and he has more than $150k USD in his bank account. He insisted we go to a bar and I be a wingman for him. I say NOPE to all of this and he said something like ""come oooon, what's wrong with you? You're young!"" which he said every time I said no to anything.

Things got really weird when he started talking about his ""very beautiful"" 13 year old daughter and how he would show me more pics of her if I have time to stop by his hotel room. Now, I've never been to Dubai and am unfamiliar with the culture, but maybe this is part of it (please correct me if I'm wrong), but that's fucked up in most parts of the world. 

I'm not stupid and wasn't going to spend any more time with him past my own amusement, so throughout the evening I had stated many times that I will leave at 10pm. At this point it was 9:30 and I wanted to bounce. He insisted we get food before I leave. Fine, last thing with this guy.

Finally after we eat, I say ""alright, I gotta go now!"" He starts acting appalled and gets extremely upset (like I hadn't been saying I needed to leave at 10 all throughout the night), saying things like ""you don't want to hang out with me, fine. I buy you food, I do this and that and you still want to leave early!"" I say ""I never asked you to buy me anything, you've insisted! I've told you numerous times that I will leave at 10, and I will."" He starts guilting me, saying ""fine, go then. No don't worry about this meal, I said I'd pay for it and I will, and you still want to go. Fine."" I say ""nope I'll pay for my own meal. Nice meeting you, see you later!"" and I got the fuck outta there.

Maybe it was just a typical encounter with a lonely, drunk, creepy middle aged man from Dubai, but boy was an encounter with this type of person weird to me.

SO, who have been the weirdest people you've met/hung out with while solo?",solotravel,CrustyLipschitz

Update on the solo soul searching trip,"Thank you for all who left good ideas and nice comments. A few places have crossed my mind and I wanted to ask for advice on anyone whose been to these places. Lots have mentioned New Zealand and Bali. Someone just mentioned Egypt on the feed which is my life goal and most said it wasn’t entirely unsafe. Anyways, here are my ideas: 

Israel- seems very spiritual and I’ve actually heard it’s really safe and peaceful. It would be amazingly intimate to visit places the Bible has mentioned. 

Greece- I’ve wanted to do this one for a long time but only two or three mentioned this. 

Taiwan- why not? 

Alaska- I wouldn’t mind living in the freezing cold for a little- as long as I’m alone and free thinking. 

Hawaii- still on my list and it is in the U.S. which might be more feasible if I do travel in February.

Maldives- sounds relaxing 

Ireland- I got a lot of people saying this one and I sure wouldn’t mind. 

Most of these are open to travel with a negative

Travel in your teens /twenties vs. travel in your forties/fifties ?,"I've spent my twenties and my thirties (I'm about to turn 38) focused on raising children and building my career.

Realistically, it's going to be in my late forties and early fifties when I'm going to get to do things like sections of the Pacific Crest Trail, and other things of that magnitude (I'm referring to several months away at a time, rather than just a week or so here and there).

First Solo Trip - How to Cope with Massive Change in Perspective?,"Before I decided to take this trip, I was very comfortable in life. I had a great job, a good gf, and a routine in life where I branched out of my comfort zone once in a while. However, after talking with a couple of close friends and taking LSD, I decided I didn't want a life of constant comfort/familiarity. I aggressively interviewed for a better job, broke up with my gf, and booked a solo trip to Mexico - I jumped in the deep end.

I just got back from my trip and it was possibly the best experience in my life. Where I'm from in the US, the culture is heavily based around money/status/material objects. However, when I was in Mexico, I didn't see many luxury cars and mansions, but rather met amazing individuals with strong personalities/character. There were quite a few people who pursued creative careers where they got to express themselves, people who I had just met being extremely welcoming, offering me drinks, suggestions on where to go, and access to anything I wanted. If we partied too hard one night, they offered to look after me, made sure I was having a good time and ultimately being safe. Even though the trip was only 2 weeks, by the end of it I felt closer to them than some of my best friends. 

I'm feeling very confused and sad now, because it feels like my worldview and values changed. I felt like I was my authentic self when I was alone in Mexico - so much more extroverted, meeting new people everyday, going on dates, and loving life. I felt like I truly had a passion for life and not just chasing the same things people around me are/going through motions. Now that I'm back home in the same place, with the same people, doing the same things, my mindset is reverting back to the old me. It feels like a lot of what I previously valued went out the window and I have more appreciation for exploring new places, meeting likeminded and kindhearted people, and living life to the fullest.

Is this a phase that will eventually pass? While I don't want to be sad anymore, I definitely don't want to crawl back into a life of extreme comfort.",solotravel,1stTimeTravels

New name while traveling,"Does anybody else go by (a) different name(s) while they’re traveling? 

I never really liked my full first name or the default shortened version of it. I’m from the northeast US and the first vowel is an “a” followed by a double consonant so its already overly nasal, but also since English has like 8 different ways “a” can be pronounced, accents have a HUGE effect on the way it comes out. Half the time i feel like I’M saying it wrong! 

I recently left to solo travel around the US doing workaways and seasonal jobs and have been going by a different nickname; one that’s still contained in the original, just an isolation of the middle syllable. It’s short, sweet, and easy to pronounce and remember. It’s taken a minute to adjust To it but honestly it fits well! I feel like a new person, like I’m really getting a fresh start.

No one back home knows I’m doing this and I feel like they would laugh. Maybe because it seems arbitrary, maybe because the new name is cooler and they think I’m trying too hard, maybe because it sounds like it’s short for something else entirely. I don’t care, I like it.

If I finish in my first city and decide I don’t like how it feels, I still have two or three other nicknames I can extract from my birth name (thanks dad!). When I move onto my next place I can always switch it up again and try something new! Maybe I’ll adopt a slightly different persona based on the nickname and region, who knows! The possibilities are endless! 

If you guys have ever done something like this, let me know how it turned out for you. Is it confusing to keep it all straight? Does it always feel like lying? Do you find that your personality shifts with the name? I feel like at the very least, this could be a cool social experiment.",solotravel,cjwellz13
"Met someone special, things could be great, 2020 thought otherwise, a lesson is learned","So, a little less than a year ago, I’ve traveled solo to Buenos Aires where I stayed for a month. Everything was great and became even better during my last week there, when I’ve met this cute and quite unconventional girl. She was also a foreigner, a (much more experienced) solo traveler, and she was staying there for a couple of months or so. From the moment I laid my eyes on her I knew she was special. Our first encounter confirmed that. I like to believe that she saw something in me as well. We’ve spent some relaxing time together (sightseeing, sitting in parks and just talk, taking lunch, etc.), but nothing more. 

Knowing that there was only a few days left for me there, and given the fact that I was in a near to end longtime relationship (which I also told her about), any thought of taking things further seemed pointless and inappropriate. Also, I wasn't so sure about my actual feelings for her, since I didn't knew her that well yet. Saying goodbye was tough, but I remained positive knowing that being in touch, it would give us the opportunity to know each other better and maybe meet again somehow down the road... I thought.

Long story short, came back home, ended my longtime relationship (not the easiest period for me), while messaging with her at an almost daily basis. At the beginning she was very responsive, playful and always so thoughtful, which made me think about her a lot during the days. It was obvious though that she was expecting something more from my part. I let her down. I didn’t respond as I should. Instead I was trying to be rational and keep things friendly and casual. I also needed to clear my head from my recent, difficult, brake up. There will be a better moment for this… I was thinking.

That’s when I started noticing her initial warm reactions to gradually cool down. This shook me up a little, and made me realize how much I liked her. Right before I enter the friend zone (or maybe a little bit after), I decided that, even if it’s late and despite knowing that I was risking our still fragile friendship, I had to be more direct with her. 

And then… covid-19 happened, quarantine imposed, her flight back home canceled and everything else became secondary. I naturally shifted my focus on her safety and tried to be helpful, supportive and a little advisory. When she is back home, safe and relaxed, then we can discuss about anything. The last thing she needs right now, is me writing about pink purple skies and smooth fiery lips… I thought.

Meanwhile, she had previously met and made friends with a local guy, and since she was trying to find a better (to her current miserable) place to stay and reduce costs as well, she apparently accepted his offer to go and stay with him, until her departure. To be fair though, I don't really know if that's the way it happened. Only my assumption.

But again, a couple of days before she was about to fly back home, Argentina (only country in the world) banned all inbound and outbound flights for the next 4-5 months! She now was a foreign girl in a foreign country, jobless, and with no other option than to stay there and try to weather this pandemic storm and the upcoming threatening winter. That’s when you realize that, not being able to help someone you care about so much, it’s probably the worst feeling ever! I should also mention that I offered some financial help, but her being such a proud (and stubborn) person, didn’t want to hear any of that.

Soon, the frequency of her messaging started to drop and after a relatively long period of silence, she came back with a lengthy message stating, among other, that she is ok and that “there’s been some… developments”, and her up to then roommate is now her boyfriend.

To be honest, I thought I was prepared for this eventuality (for which I blame none but myself), but it struck me much harder than I could possibly imagine. I’ve sent back a relatively ~~charged~~ emotional message along with a poem I had written before, where I made clear my feelings for her. I also stated that I understand, and although it might take some time, I will eventually write back since my caring and interest for her was real and above anything else.

It took more than a month, when I finally sent a long and relatively friendly letter, hoping to at least re-establish some basic communication. A few days later, instead of an answer I discovered that I got blocked (for the first time in my life, yeah!). Such a weird feeling. A big “why”, zero answers, and a few uncertain and contradictory assumptions, is all you left with. For the rest of your existence!

But it’s been more than two months now, and during this period the situation in Argentina went downhill in multiple ways, so it’s difficult for me to stop thinking and worrying about her. They say that time cures everything, and that the best antidote is to just meet new people. I did that, moved on, but to be honest, I still have this bad taste in mouth from how things ended up. More importantly though, I simply miss my once friend and I can only hope that she’s ok.

Anyway, this is a lesson learned and at the same time my advice to anyone (especially travelers): if you unexpectedly meet someone truly special for you, make her/him your overall priority, change schedules, forget about others, and let her/him know exactly how you feel. Don’t wait for the “proper” moment. And as we all know very well by now, tomorrow should never be taken for granted. Neither the feelings of another person.

Safe travels to all

EDIT: 

Ok I admit that my reaction was probably a mistake and I can see this more clearly now. But again, it's better to show your annoyance verbally (or written) than not say anything at all. Especially when there's the distance factor which leads to many misinterpretations, no matter how cool and smart the other person is.",solotravel,leo_4m
"I feel that I'm getting too comfortable with the 9-5 life, and that it's going to be difficult to long term travel again.","So bit of backstory, I made [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/g85w4p/ive_come_to_a_decision_on_what_to_do_once_this/) about 6 months ago. From that point, I've found a very well paying job, as well as an incredibly affordable living situation. With the current state of affairs of the world, I am still shooting to leave in late 2021 for a 12-18 month trip around the world.

What makes me nervous is I'm getting too comfortable with my 9-5 job life, I am making quite a bit more than I thought I would be, so I'm saving 3x more for my trip then I need. I like my job, and really like my relaxing life right now. With the rate I'm saving, I could literally pay off all of my student loans within 12 months.  Given quarantine, I am spending quite a bit more time and money on my home space, and frankly on the year leading up to my initial trip, I was minimalizing my possessions so it would be easier to leave everything behind. I feel comfortable hanging out at home all day now, I love to travel but right now my home office feels relaxing.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go on this grand adventure around the world, I want to do something that most people in American society will never have the opportunity to do. I want to see how much a 12+ month trip will change me as a person, but I'm getting nervous that when the time comes to send in my resignation, I won't be able to do it. I had so much energy and excitement to leave in May 2020, but since that didn't happen and I don't know how long it's going to be until I can leave now, I don't know how to target my energy?

Anyone else feeling these vibes?

Edit: As many people are questioning the topic of finances. This is my issue, I literally set up my entire life up until the point where I want to leave to save money.  I could have afforded a really nice apartment, instead I'm living with 3 room mates, I could afford to treat myself and eat out more, instead I meal prep and shop with coupons, etc. I planned to sell my truck, my motorcycle, about $5000 worth of mechanic tools, etc.So money is the last worry in my mind, It's all about personal feelings at this point.

Financial Plan at the moment, which will be fully funded by August of 2021:

\- 6 months of living expenses in case of unemployment.

\- 12 months of everyday travel costs - this factors in not working on the road, day to day expenses. When volunteering/working along the way, I can bump this to 14-18 months.

\- 18 months of student loan payments for the entire time I'm gone.

\- a few thousand in my 401k and roth IRA up until the point where I leave, as I want to contribute to that as much as I can in my youth.

\- Around 10,000 dollars left over for savings once I get home, as I don't want to be completely broke savings wise. Rolling back into the USA being like ""I only have $4"" while boarding my plane home is not the way I want to end things.

So Don't worry, I'm being financially responsible :)

EDIT 2: Once again, Finances are not the problem, Student loans are not the problem, paying off student loans are not a problem or even a concerning thought. With this plan I will have all of my student loans payed off in 4 years or less. Please stop saying I'm dumb for not paying off student loans immediately and pushing my already delayed trip that was the only thing keeping me sane throughout my graduate program back another 12 months. If I was smart I would drop the $20,000 I have saved for this trip into the stock market instead of blowing it traveling around the world for an entire year. This isn't about the money.  


  
EDIT 3: Decided the best way to get out of this slump is to travel more, Currently looking at flights for late November for safer locations, Possibly camping somewhere or a more distanced holiday. ",solotravel,mordor958

1 Week in Peru: May 2021,"Hey friends! 

First and foremost, in case you didn't see it, Budget Air is pushing an AeroMexico deal that got me roundtrip from SLC&gt;LIM for **$267.** No idea about other departure hubs, but I'd imagine it's not JUST for SLC, so yeah. Don't say you weren't told. 

Anywho, I've got essentially a full week in Peru (something like 9 days to pad travel and have an actual, full week) for May of 2021. 

I have done some decent research and basically came to the idea that I should do a 60/40 or 70/30 ish time split between Cusco and Lima, with Cusco getting more time. 

Of COURSE, I want to see Machu Picchu, and I do love the outdoors in my own right (I currently live in Salt Lake) but that will probably be a 1-2 day thing for me, rather than the full 4-5 day Inca Trail. 

I am a big fan of hostel life, nightlife (although I like local dives more than clubs), and just generally interesting places to wander. Do you think my split is appropriate? I've heard Lima can be underwhelming, and was considering not bothering for more than a full day or so and just heading right over to Cusco and surrounding. Basically, making it a trip to Cusco with a layover in Lima.  

Any hostel recommendations, general thoughts on the itinerary, etc.?

**Tl;dr possible itinerary:**

Travel days excluded\*  
Day 1: Lima exploration and lots of food, night out

Day 2: Basically the same

Day 3: Leave for Cusco and explore area around my hostel

Day 4: Machu Picchu 

Day 5: Maybe MP again or more Cusco hangs

Day 6: One of the day trips around Cusco 

Day 7: Back to Lima, hang out until flight the next day.

"New remote job, silly question?","I just got a remote job doing software work, super exciting for travel prospects! Anyway, I hear a lot of you talk about remote travel or being a digital nomad. Do you talk with your employer about your plans to travel or where you are at location wise? Or, is there a general consensus of “if the work gets done, you don’t need to tell me where you are”.",solotravel,DerMonolith
Doing it again later on...,"Hey,

When I was 25 I went travelling with my girlfriend of the time to Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, India, Sri Lanka and Nepal for a yearlong trip. I cycled through most of SE Asia and hitchiked through Malaysia. 

6 years on and I got married and had a baby as I always planned to do. That trip has changed me forever though and I still think of something from it every day. Never has there been another year in my life which I can remember so well.

Anyway I plan to retire at 55 and I have told my wife from the start that I plan to go away to do some proper travelling again. We often take city breaks in Europe together and we visit her home country of Japan once a year or so. 

Her idea of a great holiday is the perfect hotel room and complete comfort. I want to see more chaos and dirt.

I am considering cycling through South America or maybe getting a motorbike and doing more or perhsps just travelling to all those far flung places with a backpack.

I guess my question is do you think this is a morally OK thing to do? My daughter will be in her twenties and my wife is very independent, I was also thinking she could meet me for breaks in some countries.

My other question is, what is it like travelling at that age? I am very into keeping fit and if luck is on my side hopefully I will still have my health at that age. What is it really like being the old guy at the hostel?

Thanks",solotravel,kknd_cf
Looking for a particular wardrobe packing solution.,"I came across [this backpack](https://www.carryology.com/sponsored/this-travel-backpack-is-your-portable-wardrobe/) on kickstarter. I'm not so much interested in the backpack, but the wardrobe system that comes with it. It's a hanging and compartmentalized system with straps to cinch it down. Would anyone have a lead on something like this? Searching I've done online has only yielded packing cubes or hanging systems for luggage with two hooks and no strap to cinch things down.

"Nagging Thought - Making it work with moving out, working etc...","Currently planning a year long trip (hopefully) as soon as everything gets back to normal. I'm 25, currently earning £18,000 a year, and living at home with my family. Doing a lot of travelling is a big goal of mine but I also don't want to stay at home any longer; I want to be independent.

However, I'm grappling with the idea of having to choose - I feel like moving out is a commitment (even though I've been to uni before) that will impede my ability to travel to the extent that I want to. I want this long trip then to have the ability to travel frequently as well but I've got nagging thoughts about it like   
\- What about paying rent I'm away, urely I won't be able to afford both?  
\- I could just move back with family briefly around travelling but if I move out i can't keep just going back and forth,  
\- If I just fuck it, move out and go travelling for a while, then come back, will I just be able to move back with friends again or will I need to move back with family?  
\- What about all my stuff?  


I know these arent HUGE problems; I'm gonna go travelling and that's that, and to an extent I feel a bit stupid as these just seem like, first world problems, but it is a weird time this age I feel. i feel like I'm being pulled in different directions while also running out of time and freedom before 'real life' kicks in.  
I 'm not looking for all the answers to these questions, but if anyone in a similar situation or with experience making it work could give some advice that'd be great as this is something that I'm really struggling to make work in my head. Like, realistically, how will this play out? What should I do? Is there solutions I'm not thinking of?",solotravel,agwa2k16

Which was the laxest and strictest border crossing?,"**Laxest border crossing** (discounting the places without formal border control eg Schengen): 

For me it's the La Linea crossing into Spain. Inside the border post there were a set of automated gates, and a manual counter. I instinctively went to the automated gates, thinking that like a normal border post these would be faster, only to find they are not turned on. Only then did I notice everyone was going to the manual counter. I went up and tried to hand over my passport. The official glanced at the cover, didn't even take it, and waved me through. :o

**Strictest border crossing:**

Macau by far. I got a pat-down search by officials before I boarded the ferry, this was even stricter than flying, so I had a feeling things wouldn't be easy.

And I was right, as soon as I stepped off the ferry, I got taken into a holding room. Three or four officials started questioning me: what are you doing here, where did you go before, how much cash I had on me (and can they photograph the cash?), what are the names and occupation of my parents, where will I be staying etc etc. They asked to see my travel photos and my social media apps.

After a round of questioning they took me into a second holding room, with a dozen other people awaiting processing.  Some of these people were deported while I waited so I was nervous I would be too. After a very nerve wracking hour they finally took me to the immigration counter to have my passport processed. All in all it ended well.",solotravel,123felix
Debating 3 Mexican cities,"I’m traveling to CDMX for 5 days. I just love CDMX just so much to do but I’ve always wanted to visit a “Pueblo Mágico” I have narrowed it down to 3 cities driving distance away from CDMX. 

Cholula, Puebla
San Miguel De Allende , Guanajuato 
Taxco Guerrero 

There’s so much hype on San Miguel De Allende but the videos and seen the only thing that people seem to talk about is about the Parroquia that’s prominent building there. 

Cholula has the pyramid and all the churches. 

Taxco in my opinion looks more attractive to me just the way the city looks and “feel” it gives off in the videos.

Then I want to cross the border to Belize and be there like 4 days, then Guatemala for 3 days, Honduras for 4 days and finally Nicaragua for 3 days. From Nicaragua I would fly again to my country.

Can someone from those countries or someone who has travelled there tell me your experiences? Is it safe?

Mexico - Dia de Muertos 2021,"Usually this time of year I try to flee my cold and dark home here in Europe to somewhere sunny and warm. Since this years plans got canceled by the pandemic I thought I'd get a head start on next year - in the hope that we've got everything under control by then.

Mexico has been on top of my to-go list for some time now, so I started to plan the following trip for the end of October/beginning of November:

* Mexico City: 5 Days, including a day trip to Teotihuacán
* Puebla: 2 Days
* Oaxaca: 4 Days, during the festivities

 

I'm planning on traveling domestically by bus, are there any other stops along my route you would suggest? Are two days in Puebla too little time? Also, if you have recommendations on where to stay in those places I'd be glad to hear them!

As for Dia de Muertos in Oaxaca, I found a trip on G-Adventures which covers that part of my trip and would also add a few days in Puerto Escondido. Since it's very reasonably priced and I've also read some positive reviews on G-Adventures on here I'm thinking about booking that. If anyone here traveled with them in Mexico I'd be happy about some reviews.

Finally a somewhat cultural question. Where I'm from All Saints Day is a rather private holiday. You visit the graves of family and friends, which have been decorated the days before, but it would be rather strange to have tourists there. From what I've read online that's quite different for Dia de Muertos - as long as you behave and dress accordingly it's fine to visit the graveyards. Any locals or people that have been in Mexico for Dia de Muertos here that wanna chime in? I just want to make sure I don't offend anyone while I'm there.

"8,000 miles in 2 weeks","In April of next year, I have to drive to Tucson for some work/business purposes. So assuming a baseline, I will have to drive to Arizona and back at the bare minimum for this trip. I have wanted to do a long solo road trip across the US landscapes for some time. I have enough vacation days to take approximately 10-11 days off on top of 3-4 days for my work in Tucson. So assuming that, I will have about 2 weeks to do this trip give or take a few days. My estimates say that just the driving part of this trip will take 120-150 hrs. So I will budget a week for just driving. That leaves me with the other week for my work in Tucson and any stops I make, so it will probably be a split of 3-4 days in Tucson and 3-4 days of sightseeing in various cities/parks across the US for a combined total of 7 days of non-driving. This trip from end to end will be roughly 8,000 miles. I will be driving to Arizona no matter what due to work, but I would like to see more of the western US by road as it is meant to be seen. The longest drive I have done before is Tampa-El Paso-Tampa so this will be quite a bit longer than that. I am fully aware that this trip will be very tolling on the body, but it should also be the adventure of a lifetime. This will be a solo trip by car with just me and my Toyota. Any advice on travel tips or what to see along the way is greatly appreciated. I would imagine that the mountainous areas of Lake Tahoe, Colorado and maybe Utah would have some snow during mid-April when I will be taking this trip, and I plan to take this route having accounted for snow along this route. I only plan to explore Dallas, Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Lake Tahoe, Seattle, Denver, and Detroit. Any other stops will be for rest/sleep. With that in mind, here is the planned route:

Tampa-Dallas

Dallas-Tucson

Tucson-Phoenix

Phoenix-Grand Canyon

Grand Canyon-Los Angeles

Los Angeles-San Francisco

San Francisco-Sacramento

Sacramento-Lake Tahoe

Lake Tahoe-Portland

Either way, in the 2 weeks I was there, I got used to it eventually but I was never fully comfortable. I can only assume this is because MXC is high above sea level?

Public transport through UK,"I'm planning a trip to UK, hopefully not so far in the future yet not during these hard days of pandemic. My main target for this trip is to see several places linked with technology and transport which are not so close to each other. For early plans I decided to visit places in West Midlands, Shropshire, Cheshire etc. My biggest issue is how to travel across these counties or through them by the means of public transport. The routes for example like Liverpool-Chester-Birmingham or some small routes like Birmingham-Bridgnorth. Travelling by rail seem to be quite a good pn shorter routes (Return on the same day ticket what a great idea!) But they start be quite expensive on longer routes at least for my home country standards. If You have any tips for travelling by rail I would really appreciate them. As for other ways like Buses I have no idea at all but heard they are cheaper and of course can get You where there's no railway. There are of course car rent companies which I consider as well (of course that's not public transport) but Haven't found any which will allow me to use their cars (I'm 21 with driving license for 3 years).

Visiting India,"I saw some negative experiences from people visiting India. As an Indian now living in the US, here are my two cents that I believe will make a trip to India much much better.

1. I do not recommend visiting the big metropolitan cities (Delhi, Mumbai) unless you are a foodie. They are unsafe and chaotic and hard to navigate. If you have an Indian friend then spend a couple days in ONE city with them and eat lots of food. If you like clubbing then hit up some clubs, because the Indian clubbing experience is unique and lots of fun. But make sure to go with a native friend who has experience. I am from Delhi. 

2. Visit the mountains in the north. Go trekking. If any of you want recommendations on hiking companies then feel free to DM me.

3. Visit the south, I highly recommend the backwaters in Kerala.

4. Visit Rajasthan, a state with incredibly unique culture with everything from architecture, food, music and clothing. But do NOT visit the big cities like Jaipur. They aren’t worth it. 

5. Hit up some national parks. I recommend Kaziranga, Gir national park etc. 

6. The northeast is beautiful and you will never find culture like you find in certain places there, like Shillong and Nagaland. 

7. Continue on to Nepal or Bhutan.

Edit: I love the big cities in India. I love the chaos, the architecture, the food, everything. However it can be overwhelming and even dangerous for a solo traveler who doesn’t have an Indian companion. I’d like to add that as a woman I never go out alone even though I grew up in Delhi.

Edit 2: I didn’t expect so many people to read this! I’d I’d known I’d have gone into more detail. Thank you to all the folks in the comments who did that!

5000 km (25 day) road trip through TURKEY in 2021 [ITINERARY REVIEW],"Not sure about the exact timeline of this trip for obvious reasons, but in 2021 I intend to go all around Turkey and visit a lot of major historical sites on the way

I used Rome2Rio to get a rough idea of how I will make this trip around Turkey starting at Istanbul and ending at Istanbul. My planned trip will be around 25 days (my visa will only be valid for 30 days max due to my nationality), but if you count up the days in my itinerary, you'll notice they  add up to 20-23 days. Transportation doesn't seem to be the most reliable in Eastern Turkey, and based on previous experiences in the Balkans, I am expecting to miss a few connections and spend a few extra nights at someplaces. I am trying to avoid flights but will take one if absolutely necessary (I am not near Istanbul the end of the trip). This probably looks like a LOT for a month, but I have traveled at this pace before and I sleep like a baby in overnight transportation, so I don't usually get tired from fast-paced trips

# Where I need help/suggestions

1. If you see my route going past a cool spot that I haven't listed, please let me know, and I will see if I can squeeze it into the itinerary

Best country/route for a solo bicycle trip?,"I have traveled countries on all continents as a backpacker and I recently (partly thanks to the virus) started riding road bike in my home country (Germany) as a hobby and sport.
So now I am thinking, once it’s possible again, to combine the two, but don’t really know where to start.
Do any of you have experience doing (also short, city to city) trips in any cool countries? My concerns are mainly about safety, riding through the countryside where probably no other tourists ever are, and about road conditions and geographic circumstances (elevation, rainy seasons, ...).
Would be happy to hear from your experiences!",solotravel,hazuke37

In need of some encouragement,"I have been working for many years to make one of my childhood dreams, to solo travel the world, a possibility. As I get closer to achieving that I am starting to feel insurmountably discouraged, and hoping the community here can remind me why this is a worthwhile effort in the first place.

I started school at 20 having worked in retail through the worst of the ‘08 recession and wanting a better life. I graduated at 25 with $80k in student loan debt, and started working my ass off to have some hope of paying that off so I could travel before I get too old. Now at 30, I am actually six months away from being debt free!

However these 10 years have taken much more of an emotional and physical toll than I wanted. I paid my loans by working my ASS off at a very corporate Fortune 500 company, moving every year or two to live at our construction sites. My hair is falling out and I am becoming increasingly sad every year that I make a group of friends only to leave them behind when I move to the next project. All of my coworkers are very conservative people who have hardly left the USA, let alone as free-wheeling solo travelers, so whenever I bring up my dreams I just sound like a crazy child. Everybody around me just asks why don’t I buy a house, worry about my credit score and 401k, etc.

I just can’t ignore how positive my travel experiences have been. I find myself an infinitely more compassionate, thoughtful, and patient person when I am free on the road. My ‘fantasy’ is to solo travel indefinitely, without any sort of schedule or agenda and understand the world outside of the constructs imposed on us. I would like to redefine my life outside of the confines of the corporate world and the ‘American dream’.

Also I am really not confident I want to live or raise children in the USA. This has been an incredibly difficult place to be a middle class person and I don’t want my children to be preyed on by moneyed interests the way I have been. I believe that many places in the world are actually much more ‘free’ and I want to open my eyes to that.",solotravel,oaklicious

Me. My dog. And my Honda Civic. Feb-May 2021,"I work for Amazon (totally remote, flexible hours). I relocated to Seattle in March 2020 just as everything started to shut down. I’ve never stepped foot in the office, I haven’t made many friends, and yet I’m paying $2000+ in rent just to be near a workplace that is still locked down.

So here is my idea. My lease is up in February 2021. I have plenty of income. Why not pick a few of these ~$1500/month all inclusive AirBNB places around the country while working remote and solo travel from place to place? It would still be cheaper than the rent in Seattle.

If you made it this far, thank you. I’d also love some recommendations. I’m thinking Montana, Idaho, Colorado, etc. being that they are drivable and scenic.",solotravel,messyrabbits

"Trip report: Three trips in New South Wales, Australia","I usually take an overseas holiday each year, but that's legally prohibited for Australians for the foreseeable future due to the pandemic. Instead, I made three road trips around the state of New South Wales from my home town of Canberra over August and September. I'm posting a trip report to share my experiences for the interest of other Australians.

**Trip 1: Canberra to Dubbo**

I took two weeks off in August, with plans to spend most of this time in Sydney. However, due to a COVID outbreak in Sydney at the time, the Australian Capital Territory Government strongly advised Canberrans to avoid the city and holiday in areas of NSW with no COVID cases. As a result, I booked a two day trip to the regional city of Dubbo, which is best known for being home to the vast Western Plains Zoo (the sister zoo to the famous Taronga Zoo in Sydney), and left the next day.

This was my first solo road trip anywhere, and I really enjoyed the experience. The drive to Dubbo was lengthy, but very scenic. I stopped in at Cowra, where I had my first cafe lunch since March and visited the remnants of the World War II prisoner of war camp (not very interesting) and the Japanese cemetery (fascinating).

I spent almost all of the next day at Western Plains Zoo, which was fantastic. Unfortunately due to COVID restrictions the keeper talks and animal feeding sessions had been cancelled, but there were good video versions of the keeper talks for about half of the displays. I drove home the next day via Parkes, where I visited the famous radio telescope (aka 'The Dish') and had the largest hamburger I've ever eaten for lunch.

Overall, this was a fantastic trip. I really wished that I'd allocated at least another couple of days to it to visit more of the towns in this region as there was a lot to see.

**Trip 2: Canberra to Wollongong**

With COVID advisories still in place for Sydney, I decided to spend some of the next week of my leave in the largest city in the world Canberrans were able to freely visit at the time: the coastal city of Wollongong! (population 300,000).

I drove up via the pretty coastal town of Kiama, where it's blowhole was in fine form due to heavy seas. I spent the afternoon walking around Wollongong's spectacular beach and charmless business district.

I spent the next morning at the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society's facilities at an airport to the south of Wollongong. This was much better than I was expecting, as all visitors are given a guided tour (largely for OH&amp;S reasons) and it had a huge collection of well maintained planes. Some of the aircraft visitors are usually able to enter were unavailable due to social distancing restrictions, but I was able to tour their ex-Qantas Boeing 747. After lunch I visited the Nan Tien Temple, which is one of the largest Buddhist temples in Australia - it was huge, but not terribly interesting.

This was also a fun trip. Two days was about enough though.

**Trip 3: Canberra to Sydney**

In September the advisory against visiting Sydney was eased when case numbers dropped to very low levels, so I took half a week off and headed up there. As Canberra hadn't had any COVID cases for months and there is almost no use of face masks (with the local government not requiring this in any circumstances), visiting Sydney was a novelty in that the NSW Government was strongly encouraging people to wear face marks on public transport and other places where maintaining social distancing was difficult.

I spent much of my time visiting family, but also rattled around the city. Take-up of face masks seemed to be at around 50% on public transport and lower levels in most other places. Several art galleries I visited were very strongly encouraging visitors to wear marks. I wore mine whenever I was in public transport, cramped shops and at other locations where doing so was requested or seemed sensible. The absence of foreign tourists was very noticeable, and depressing, with Circular Quay and the Opera House area being almost deserted in the middle of the day.

I also enjoyed this trip. The COVID restrictions were sensible, and were working well.

**Conclusions**

These three trips really helped me to get my confidence back regarding travelling outside of Canberra and eating in cafes and restaurants following our lockdown period. It was possible to enjoy the trips while still following COVID safe practices. Contingent on COVID case numbers remaining very low, I'm looking forward to further travel around Australia now that most of the internal border restrictions have been eased or removed.",solotravel,Appropriate_Volume
My first solo travel experience!!!,"First solo travel experience!!

Hey guys I just wanted to chime in and talk about the trip I went on this past weekend! 

With Covid going on it’s been a pretty dull year so far but I wanted to try and do something safely. I live in NJ and decided to drive to Virginia to go camping in the Shenandoah valley. While down there I visited the Luray caverns which I must say were absolutely beautiful and I fell in love with Shenandoah National park. 

This was the first solo trip I ever went on! On top of that this is the first time I’ve ever gone camping too! I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t anxious and nervous approaching it. I was a little scared that I would end up not liking it and just sucking it up telling people it was great. 

My experience truly was incredible! I finally understand all the love and hype for solo travel that I’ve been looking into for months. I felt so at peace the entire time. It was such a good feeling knowing everything I was doing, was literally what I wanted to do. There were no arguments about what to do or any of the other typical situations with group trips. 

I’m so excited for things to improve in the world so I can travel a little more openly and start this solo travel journey! 

I love all of your posts in this sub, they truly make me excited for what is out there. 

Also before the negativity comes in with traveling during Covid. I actually took a Rapid test today which came back negative and I am quarantining until my PCR test results come back!

Reposting because my first post was taken down for adding social media. Didn’t realize that wasn’t allowed.",solotravel,jeremyhendler
How do you deal with your family back home?,"I’m sure majority of people here are around the ages of 18-35, some probably even older. I’m in my 20s, and come from a family where we are all really close. All my brothers and parents live in the same city and see each other frequently.  I solo travelled once, it was for a 2 voluntary day work conference in London, and I decided to stay instead for a week so I can have fun afterwards. I was always interested in being to a new country alone and thought this was the perfect opportunity to start. My parents were very uneasy with me going alone, they wanted my brothers to come with me. My brothers never solo travelled either, only trips they taken were family trips. It was a battlefield trying to convince them that I needed this for work (even though it was voluntary but I made it seem like it was a must) and since my brothers weren’t able to just get up and come with me, my parents finally accepted. While I was in London my mom was practically texting me throughout the day and we talked on the phone every night. When I came back my dad told me in secret that that week was the most he’s ever seen my mom stressed out, but that he was proud that I got a new city experience lol

"3ish Month Trip, Need Suggestions Given The Following Situation","I appreciate any thoughts. The post is long, but I wanted to give context.

Background: Late 20s Male. Mech eng, former US service member(lived and traveled overseas). 1800/month passive income. No expenses. No debt. At or above US averages for my age in cash and in 401k. 

The Situation: In the next few weeks I'll be negotiating a raise that I believe I deserve and discussing my future at the company long term. I don't want to get bogged down too much on these details, but the important part is I live in NJ and if significant raises or promotions don't seem likely in the next 5 years then I'm bailing on NJ due to the cost of living. 

The Question Preface: If this scenario plays out(seems likely) and covid has died down a bit by Spring/Summer 2021 I would like to take my time in finding a new job. My criteria for a new location leaves the vast majority of the US open. My thinking is whether I am in NJ or any other place with internet I can work on finding a job and applying, plus after my lease is up I'll have nowhere to live(I'm getting rid of pretty much everything I own"")

The Actual Question: Where can I live(outside US) for 1800 usd/month? I'd dip into savings if I wanted to do day trips etc. 

Requirements: Costal. Reliable internet. Not completely off grid, but not in the heart of a major city"". Need a private room. Hostel is fine, but private room required. Car not required. 

Research thus far: I've found a lot of the ""10 cheapest places to retire"" lists have been a good start. 

Cascais, Portugal- Has anyone been here? It seems nearly too good to be true. I like the fact that I'm in easy train shot to Lisbon and could walk from my room to the beach, supermarket, downtown. 

Cartagena, Colombia- I'm struggling to research if there is a suburb with easy access to the city. I don't really want to be ""in-in"" the city or any major city. Any experience anyone?

Mancora, Peru- The articles surrounding here either talk about it being a big party town or sleepy town, I'm assuming it is seasonal, any thoughts?

Typical day- I wake up and grab a local coffee/espresso with a light walk. Go back to my room, research jobs, areas, and tailor resumes for 2-4 hours. Eat lunch then go for a rigorous workout. Explore local area, read at the beach maybe get involved in some sort of group activity or learning(language, yoga, painting).

Typical Friday/Saturday- Enjoy the local bar playing music, maybe there are vacationers or expats or locals I can chat with over a beer. I'm fine with partying, but I'm not looking for a Cancun/Ibiza spring break deal.

Sunday- Take public transport to check out whatever.

The purpose of this trip is to unwind, plan, enjoy, and help me decide what I want. 

Any tips on locations to consider or comments on this whole idea?",solotravel,VkayWarrior

TL;DR Budget of \~$5,000 trying to stretch across three months seeing as much as possible while hitting some spots to paintball along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Solo Travelers, 

OK so I am starting to get a little overwhelmed while planning this trip. That's why I've come to this great community for help!

So I may be planning this a little early but I'm trying to get my ducks in a row for this upcoming summer. I have roughly $5000 maybe $7000 to spend on this trip and I'm trying to make it last for as close to 3 months as possible. 

This will be my first trip outside the U.S. so I hope to see as many places without being extremely rushed. That's why I'm shooting for a 3 month time frame. I also hope to hit a few of the paintball places on the map above. I think it would be really cool to paintball in a few different countries along the way.

I hope to pack as light as possible and hit hostels/couch surf almost the whole way. Along with the paintball stops I hope to stop in Istanbul and Slovakia to meet up with some friends. 

So I guess my question is how to I proceed to make a coherent plan where I'm able to paintball, meet my buddies, hit a few major ""attractions"", and explore local villages while staying on budget and staying as long as possible?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for all the help!

Domestic around the US to big cities and rural areas. I love everything from rural PA to downtown Chicago.

**Budget:**

I've been saving for a while, all in I wouldn't mind spending $3k (including flights/hotels)

**Accommodation:**

I was originally considering staying in a hostel (Hostal Regina Centro Historico), but that's not the smartest idea so I'll most likely do AirBnB or hotel. Will tinder be good for meeting people? **Are there any must see places if you're in Mexico City?**

Is it safe to travel by road in South East Asia?,"I have always wanted to visit Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam and I'd rather not spend a lot of time in airports so figured buses would be the best way to travel between countries.

Food ideas for a hotel room,"So here it goes: I get one shot at getting groceries for a two week quarantine in a hotel room that is equipped with a microwave and mini fridge. I am traveling by plane and don’t have room to pack a cooler, hot plate, pots, pans, etc. 

My food list so far:
instant oats, granola bars, bread, peanut butter, jelly, fruit and precut veggies. 
Anything you would add?

Back story: I currently live in the United States, and my husband is stationed overseas in Japan. I am moving over there in a few days and have a 14 day quarantine in a hotel room when I arrive. I am going straight from the plane to the hotel, so I cannot shop myself. Thankfully, I have someone shopping for me and dropping it off at the hotel. They asked me for a shopping list.",solotravel,blaiseyblaise

Any tips on what to expect at the airport for a transatlantic flight right now?,"Hi everyone! I haven’t travelled at all since, well, you know what, but I’m going on a seven hour transatlantic flight on Tuesday and wondering what should I expect. Any tips from people who’ve flown during this period? 

A few more specific questions I have are...Are airports emptier and does that mean I can arrive less than three hours before my flight? What do y’all think the chances are that the flight will be fully booked? Are airplanes doing anything to socially distance or is that over on flights? My ticket says there is still a meal, does that mean everyone’s going to be taking their masks off during the meal? If it helps, I’m flighting out of Toronto Pearson. 

I’ve already looked into the country’s entrance requirements so I’m all prepped on that front! And for you nosy people, I’m not travelling for leisure 🙄 so please keep comments to yourself, I’m taking every precaution to be as safe as possible for myself and others.

First of all, I know that travel is discouraged because of Covid-19.

I live in London and I'm looking to travel to Canada next year on a solo venture. I've found some super cheap tickets, but from the departure is 6am from Heathrow

I don't drive, nor do any of my friends in London so I'm relying on public transport.

To be there on time (so for around 3.30am) it would take almost 2 hours on 4 different buses. One change would be in a place I don't know very well, looks pretty quiet. 

  
Alternatively, I can get the tube and be there for midnight which would make me feel infinitely safer. Would it be reasonable to spend 6 hours in the airport then sleep on the 10 hour plane journey instead?",solotravel,JamesIsBored

How to plan travel around meeting locals and other travelers?,"So I see lots of posts here with folks mentioning things like visiting a new country for, say, a month, and making local friends with whom they still stay in contact. Or getting invited into a local's home for tea and dinner. Or spending the day with a local, or exploring with other travelers, etc.

I'm wondering how people find themselves in these situations? One of my favorite things when traveling is meeting locals and just hearing about their perspective; I feel like I come away from it with a deeper understanding of the place I just visited.

I also enjoy meeting fellow travelers for similar reasons, just to learn about their experiences and, I suppose, expose myself to a more diverse array of people than I would meet here in the US.

The problem with me is I'm fairly introverted. I'm not shy per se, and will try to strike up others in a hostel, for example, but if I sense a cold reception on their part then I get discouraged and withdraw, not wanting to bother them.

On top of this, I usually plan my day around visiting cool landmarks, sites, restaurants, etc. but this activity isn't super conductive to meeting others, because it feels weird to be at a temple, for example, and cold approach a stranger to just start conversing with no context. 

So far, this has been my experience, where the people I reach out to seem to not care to have anything to do with me, whether that be a group of travelers fine on being amongst themselves, or locals who don't want to interact with a foreigner.

I try and respect their space in these cases, but I can't help but wonder how people on this sub end up having such rich experiences with those they meet traveling? How do you plan your trips, and orient your daily activities, lodging, etc. to facilitate the process of meeting new people as much as possible?",solotravel,TheAbLord
I have six months to travel,"If all goes well, I'm starting university in September 2021. In January I'm quitting my job and I want to travel. I've got six months. I've got a European passport and I plan to use it.

I don't know whether to 

1 travel to a country e.g. Sweden and try to get a job for those six months. This would be ideal if any of the swedish universities I've applied to accepts me. The other plus is that I get to make more money than I spend. However it's probably shitty of me to get a job and quit six months in right?

2 going backpacking through europe. I'd choose maybe six countries and do workaways for a month at a time. I'm very worried I'll spend too much money though. Plus if I get accepted into one of the most expensive universities Ive applied to Ill probably have to skip this adventure and use all my money to cover tuition and living costs.

What do you guys think? Can you come up with any other alternatives? What do you think I should do to make the most of these six months?

What was your most memorable trip in pre-COVID 2019-2020 and what specifically would you recommend to your friends or solo travellers?,"Hey everyone,

Since not a lot of us are current travelling at the moment, thought it might be nice to reminisce about a recent travel experience while also helping to share some recommendations for people planning to travel there in the future.

**What was a memorable trip that you recently took? Are there any specific places or activities that stood out that you'd highlight to other travellers?**

I'll start! One of my favourite trips was to **Kauai, Hawaii**. I love being in the outdoors and so the activities here were perfectly suited for that. I haven't been to the other islands, but had such a great experience here I might just want to come back.

* **Transportation**: The entire island is extremely small; however, in order to make the most of it, it is highly recommended that you rent a car. This will allow you to drive to parts of the island in 1-2h. Although I would have loved to get a Jeep - you really don't need one (unless you're going to some off-road terrain) and can save money by renting a regular car.
* **Food**: Really enjoyed lots of food trucks and snacks! Recommend:
   * **The Fish Express**: This was the best poke I had (tried several locations, and only found this on the last day).
   * **Trucking Delicious**: Delicious coconut shrimp
   * **Wailua Shave Ice**: Shave ice was great here (and its different than the regular shaved ice you think of at carnivals /snowcones).
   * **Java Kai**: Think smoothie bowls and avo toast.
* **Activities:**
   * **Hiking:** Tons of great trails with all different types of scenery and lengths. Check out AllTrails app.
   * **Surfing:** I'm an absolute beginner and went to the south area (since I was advised against going to the north during the Winter season). There was a nice area next to the Sheraton which was beginner friendly. Didn't want to take a lesson since I'd taken one before and just wanted to mess around with a board. **Kauai Surf School** (I think) rented boards for $10/h. :) Am sure there were other areas where you could also rent a board but I liked that this was on the water and you could easily see where other people were trying to catch waves.",solotravel,TravoShare
"After two months of recuperation from a TBI, I am finally resuming my travels again","My flight departs tomorrow at 7AM, bound for the other side of the continent. I cannot contain my elation. Photography is pretty much my whole life and when I'm not working events, I'm on the road traveling somewhere taking shots of whatever I can. The whole time I was dealing with post-concussion syndrome, all I could think about was getting back to what means most to me- pursuing and discovering the greater world around me one after at a time. Really, it was the only thing that got me through the near sixty days of immobility and pain. I'm just so grateful, reflecting on everything that has been and, soon, what will be again.

Time is short and you never know what is going to happen with your life. The accident that caused my TBI came out of nowhere. If had happened a second later, I probably would've died. Just like that, everything would've been over and I wouldn't have a second verse to embark upon. But thankfully, I do and I am more determined than ever to make my time count. Tomorrow, I will as I begin anew.",solotravel,thenomadicphotog
West Highland Way in Spring of 2021?,"Hey everyone! I (20F) am currently in school, but will have a break between this current school and my next during May-June of 2021. My mom has mentioned the West Highland Way in Scotland before to me, and I’d LOVE to be able to go and walk it. 
I wanted to ask and see what you all thought about the possibility of traveling to Scotland from the US in that time frame. Right now I know that I’d have to quarantine for 14 days upon arrival. 

Would this trip be better traveled in, say, 2022? I do want to take a trip between no matter what but I’m trying to decide whether or not it would be better to stay within the US.

Also, if you have traveled the West Highland Way before, how was it? Is it better for solo or with a partner? My mom (51F) may or may not join me, depending.

"I'm considering taking a year off to travel, how can I best prepare myself financially","I (24m) really really want to take 12-18 months off - probably starting in 2022 but thats all dependant on a number of factors right now including covid.

I have around 15k in RRSP, 2k in TFSA, and another 40K in savings. I have no debts, no mortgage and no car. I earn roughly 80k per year currently.

I know what I want to do is a terrible financial decision especially considering the lost earrings, but I want to do it regardless. 

Basically my question is: I've got atleast 1 year to prepare myself and to minimise the impact to my financial health due to not earning an income for such a long time. I don't intend to end up broke after all of this - infact im hoping to only spend 15-20k during my travels but i haven't sat down and done the maths, i just pulled that number out of my ass...What should I be doing in preparation for this trip and what should i be doing while im travelling.",solotravel,skinnybg
"After COVID, I want to quit my job and solo travel long-term. Am I crazy?","I graduated college last year in May. I’ve been working full time since and have saved up about $45k. By the time COVID is over and travel is fully opened and welcomed again, I estimate I can grow that to around $60-75k depending on how long it takes. 
 
I’m 25 M. I have a decent job making around $50k/yr. Can double my salary if I stay with the company for another 5 years. But I hate it. I don’t hate the company, I don’t hate the people, I don’t hate the job. I hate feeling like I’m wasting my life sitting in an office doing things that I don’t want to be doing.

All I have ever been told in life is go to school, get a good job, buy a house, get married, and have kids.

I have a college education, I have a good job, I rent my own house, I have a beautiful girlfriend. And yet, I’m certainly not satisfied. The only thing I’m missing is the kids, and I don’t want any, but I’m pretty confident a child won’t make me happy either. 

I want to explore the world beyond the suburbs that my great grandparents, grandparents, parents and now myself have lived and worked in our entire lives. I want to experience different cultures and see new perspectives. I want to explore something bigger than myself. I want to overcome my fears and anxiety. I want to develop and grow into a stronger individual. I want to learn to love myself fully and be comfortable alone. Solo travel seems to satisfy all of these. Right? 

It’s so easy to get comfortable. Then before you know it, 15 years go by, you are 40 years old with kids, a wife, a mortgage. You are no longer living for yourself. You live to support others. There’s nothing wrong with this lifestyle if it makes you happy. 

I am at a very crucial point in my life where I need to decide which road I am going to take. 

I’m still young, I have no kids, the only debt I have is 20k in student loans ($250/monthly), I rent, my car is paid for, I have a good amount of savings. One or many of these things may change in the next 5 years. 

So I ask from anyone who has taken the jump, can you please share your wisdom and experience? How much money did you have saved up when you left? What is/was your long-term game plan after cash reserves dry up? How long are you going to live the lifestyle and what is the plan after? Where did you go? Can you give me any advice specific to my situation? 

Would you do it all over again?

EDIT: This post turned into great discussion and I truly appreciate everyone’s kind words and motivation. I really needed it. I want to thank everyone for their input. It has been invaluable to me. 

After reading a majority of the comments, I want to address a few of the most asked questions: 

1. Why haven’t you paid off your student loan debt? 

I’ve heavily considered it. I decided not to because the interest rates are low (3.5%). All federal loans. Meaning, I could invest the same amount of money that I would use to pay it off, earn 7% interest in the market, and profit the 3.5% spread. BUT if I’m going to be traveling long-term, I really don’t want to deal with it or have to worry about it at all. So I will more than likely pay it off before I leave. 

2. Is my girlfriend coming with me?

No. My girlfriend is awesome, don’t get me wrong. But this is something I need to do alone. Our relationship is still new. We aren’t on the cusp of getting married or anything. And she knows this is something I am considering. I’ve been transparent from the start. 

3. How did I save so much in that amount of time? 

Zero expenses. Well not zero, but pretty damn close. I was living with my dad for 17 of the past 18 months after I graduated. I just started renting at the beginning of this month. I paid nothing in rent, nothing in utilities, student loans have been deferred due to COVID, I own my car. The only expenses I had were my phone bill, car insurance, and whatever food/activities I wanted to spend money on. This allowed me to save almost all of my income. I also worked for my dad occasionally to earn some extra cash whenever I could. I realize not everyone has this opportunity. I am forever grateful that I did.

4. Can you work remotely? Is your industry easy to get back into? 

Yes and yes. My job can be done 100% remotely and there are plenty of companies in this industry that I could seek employment from with my experience. Unfortunately, my boss is old fashioned and conservative in his ways and wants everyone in the office 5 days a week. 

That being said, and with all of the helpful advice and wise words people have given me, I have laid out a new game plan:

Continue working and saving for at least the next year. This will allow me to build up more experience, put away some more cash into my reserve fund, and pay off my loans. I’ll be able to stick it out for another year. Hopefully by then COVID will have passed and people will be welcoming of foreign travelers again. 

I will then propose to my boss that I continue working for the company on a part time basis 100% remotely so I can travel and have some of my time back. If he declines, I quit and travel on my reserve cash for awhile keeping expenses low and living frugally. 

Once I need to start making an income again, I will look for a 100% remote position in my current industry. It shouldn’t be hard to find. If that doesn’t work, I will use some of the other great tips in this thread for making an income while traveling like online tutoring or teaching english.

I’m sorry I was not able to respond to many of you. I have been busy with work (ironic lol). Hopefully this update will be sufficient. Thank you again to everyone who commented and for your kind words! You truly have made this decision so much easier. The leap does not seem nearly as intimidating after hearing all of the great stories about how it worked out for people and how they did not regret it for a second. 

Much love everyone! May we all satisfy our deepest desires and live a life of fulfillment and meaning!",solotravel,LifeQuestionsMe
I need a break in the UK,"I'm a PhD student just entering my second year. I'm doing some teaching but it's conducted 100% online, and my area is basically philosophy, so as long as I have my laptop and Kindle I can basically work from anywhere.

The last few months have been... shit, to say the least. My dad suffered a spinal injury affecting his mobility, was sent a cancer screening test, my mum was diagnosed with a heart condition, my partner of 4.5 years' father had a stroke, my brother lost his job, I had to move out of my flat near the university because I couldn't find affordable nearby accommodation, and I'm now meant to be doing teaching and research at the same time. All the while, I can't travel to Vienna and live there for a few months as I hoped to - so the alternative is probably somewhere here in the UK.

I need a break. I need to get away somewhere quiet and beautiful, with some nice cafes I can just read or write on my laptop, some pubs to get a pint in the evening, and nature so I can get some fresh air and just get away from all my worries. The thing is, I don't know where to go. I've always wanted to spend some time in Edinburgh, but Airbnb doesn't show anything remotely affordable for me. I was hoping to spend maybe 3 weeks away somewhere new and different, maybe spend about £500 on accommodation. But I'm not sure where to go. I'd love to spend some more time in the lovely Yorkshire villages, but I just don't know where to go.

Does anyone have any recommendations? I'm not sure whether I should be looking on Airbnb or [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) or hostelworld or something else.

Might be worth mentioning that I don't drive but I'm very happy to get a train. And I'll probably be based in York by the time I can realistically do this.

I'd really appreciate anyone's help or advice on this one.",solotravel,unevenclimate
To be Solo Travellers - ever worry if you've completely romanticised the idea of solo travel and maybe you'll find one day its not for you?,"This is a worry I have a lot. I haven't had the means and opportunity yet to just take the leap with solo travel and see if its everything I've ever wanted. And dont get me wrong, despite my fears, I still definitely wish to do it as soon as I can. 

But I've been into the idea of solo travel for a really long time now; subscribed to here, read solo travel literature, watched vlogs etc and the whole idea is something thats always excited me. I've even influenced friends and coworkers who've had the means to go and do it and they've always been thankful. 

In general I enjoy solo activities like eating at nice restaurants alone, going to the cinema alone etc -- and yet I cant shake this feeling theres a chance I wouldn't enjoy solo travelling. The only travelling I'm use to is with friends and family. And now I'm just worried I've built up the idea of it so much, its not that it wont live up to my expectation, but that I wont enjoy it as much as if I had company. 

Not to be cheesy but this problem at some point reminded me of that one quote from Tangled: 

&gt; Rapunzel: I’ve been looking out of a window for eighteen years, dreaming about what I might feel like when those lights rise in the sky. What if it’s not everything I dreamed it would be?

&gt; Flynn Rider: It will be.

&gt; Rapunzel: And what if it is? What do I do then?

&gt; Flynn Rider: Well,that’s the good part I guess. You get to go find a new dream.

Which has provided me some hope that, as soon as I do take that first leap into solo travel, I'll find it intoxicating and will jump into another adventure. 

But I guess my question for the community is two:

1) are there any other 'to be solo travellers' who also lurk here and feel similarly?

2) and for people who have solo travelled and felt like this before, what were your first time solo travel experiences like?

Edit: thank you all so much! The responses have been overwhelming and you guys have been a massive help and comfort. So much practical advice and helpful antidotes &lt;3",solotravel,gkbbb
Trip planning for June 2021,"Hi everyone,

I  am considering going on a solo-backpacking trip in either June or July  2021 (assuming COVID blows over). So far I am looking at two regions:  Southeast Asia or South America. If I go to Southeast Asia I would like  to try and buy a motorcycle and take a month to month and a half long  trip through Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. If I go to South America, I was  thinking Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil. Any advice on  what to do, suggested routes, etc?

So far I have traveled to twenty countries and territories spanning North America, Europe, Far East, Central America, West Africa and the Caribbean. I am pretty experienced with travel in a variety of places from developed to undeveloped countries so I think I would do well in either region. I also speak decent Spanish but I do not know any Portuguese. Will that be a problem for South America? I have a month to a month and a half to work with (early June 2021 to mid July 2021) so I have enough time to get around either area I think. I should have a budget of a few thousand USD for this trip.

Any and all help or advice is appreciated.

"Tokyo, Japan advice?","Hi!

Next April, given corona virus is a bit less mad, I have to go to Tokyo for business.  
I'll be there for 3 days of work, where my flights/hotel will be sorted for me. But I've decided to take 5 days off and just stay for leisure. I'll have to pay for my hotel at this point so I think I'll change hotels if anyone has any decently priced suggestions! 

these aren't the actual dates but I find it easier to think like this :) 

Here is my plan:

1st - Get into Tokyo at 11:30 local time, travel to my hotel then spend the afternoon exploring the general area and getting food. I imagine I'll be super tired after a long travel day and to be back resting quite early given I'm working for a few days!

2nd -  Conference  
3rd - Conference  
4th - Conference  - with these days I imagine we may go out for drinks etc in the evening. We finish at around 6 - 7pm but I'll make no plans!

5th - Switch hotels, either my new hotel can keep my luggage (hotels in the UK do this) or I'll pay for a locker.  
Yoyogi park , Meiji shrine. Wander around Shibuya

6th - Seibu centre and Pokemon Center mega store, Animate store, Bandai building

7th - Odaiba, rainbow bridge, museum, general shopping in some cool stores there

8th - Disney Tokyo - I know, extremely touristy but theme parks are a joy for me. Spending a full day in Tivoli, Copenhagen is one of my fondest memories

9th - Flight at 1pm 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some concerns:**

I could stay another couple of days, the cost would be pretty minimal if I had a decently priced hotel. But I need to decide before next month when they book my flights

What car to buy for a year long US solo road trip?,"Good evening, I am a 24 year old male who just feels really lost and today I just put in my 2 weeks leaving a comfortable well pay job to go travel the US solo for some soul searching. 

I am in NYC right now and my plan is to sell my car and then drive west and hop around all the different ski resorts for the winter and then once winter ends go on a hugeeeee national park backpacking tour, spending 2–7 days at each place. Right now the highlights I am 100% going to see is glacier, Yellowstone, redwood, Tetons, arches, Zion, Yosemite, Joshua tree, Bryce cannon, grand canon, smoky mountains, and Acadia. I’m open to other suggestions too!

I’m looking for a car for this extensive trip and money is no concern. It has to handle really well in snow and the mountains and be comfortable for longgggg drives. I don’t need too much cargo room because I’m only bringing my backpacking set up and then probably a clone of it just in case equipment gets damaged or lost.

I know nothing about cars, but was thinking of getting either a fully loaded outback and probably some aftermarket rims and tires and a set of snow tires, or a Range Rover (my favorite car)  with some snow tires but I’ve heard iffy things regarding reliability.

I also enjoyed hiking alone because I could go my own speed. I even went to a winery tasting alone which was pretty nice too because I flirted with the waiter the whole time. 

However I didn't like eating alone at restaurants. And when I went for an overnight backpacking trip, I found that I don't enjoy camping alone. This was super surprising to me because I'm usually very reserved and I don't mind my own company. I live alone and never get lonely but if I go out to the woods, suddenly I'm wishing for conversation.

Budget: hostel: $33 a night. I made most of my meals. Gas to get there was probably my biggest expense.


Trip Length: 5 nights

Destination(s): New Hampshire white mountains.



Accommodation: The Notch Hostel. One of the best hostels I've stayed at. 


Activities: hiking mostly. Camping. Wine tasting.",solotravel,SilentButtDeadlies
Advice for solo trip in Ontario,"Hey fellow travellers. I (32M) am looking for do a solo trip for a couple days in Ontario to break away from life in Toronto. The last couple of months have taken its toll a bit mentally and emotionally, I could use some space to clear my mind and reset a bit. 

Personally I love being in a beautiful setting, with nature and tiny towns with coffee shops and the like around. Any recommendations for towns, beautiful landscapes or landmarks that you would recommend? I would prefer if it is within a couple hours from Toronto, so no destinations requiring a flight.

Have you ever bottled up something bad that happened to you during solo traveling?,"Sorry if that’s a confusing title.

I’ve always loved to solo travel, but as a young women, my desire to do this was always met with skepticism and fear. My family discourages my traveling because they don’t believe it’s safe for a woman to travel alone. Before I left for my first trip, my mom called and begged me to reconsider, even offering to reimburse all the money I spent. I almost caved just because I hated how upset she was, but went through with it and had a great time. My friends think it’s odd and kinda dangerous as well but they’re supportive. 

Solo traveling opened up the world to me in such an incredible way and I fell in love with it. I also used every precaution to keep myself safe and it was always enough...until it wasn’t. I was sexually assaulted on my last trip to a European country that most would consider very safe. I’m ashamed to admit this, but I never reported the attack. It’s a long road to recovery, but I do believe that I’ve made a lot of progress in overcoming this. 

I still can’t bring myself to tell anyone I know about the attack. Not my parents. Not my best friend. Not even my current boyfriend (it occurred before we got together). Every time I try, it’s like my throat closes up and I physically cannot force the words out. I just don’t want them to know they were *right*. That the worst thing they warned me could happen actually happened. Despite everything, I do desperately want to conquer this and get back out into the world, but that’s still such a terrifying concept to me now. If I tell them, they’ll have all the ammo they’ll ever need to keep me ‘grounded’. It would just take a mention of the incident to have me canceling my flight. 

And reading over this, I realize it’s pretty heavy stuff for this sub. I’m sorry to dump it all out like that, but I needed to get it out somewhere, and I worried that any other forum would warn me against traveling solo ever again. I’m hoping no one else has ever been in a similar situation, but have you ever felt the same fear of telling people when your solo travels go wrong? And if your travels did go wrong, how did you build yourself up again to resume them?

**EDIT: I’m overwhelmed by the outpouring of support here and cannot thank you all enough for your kind words. I was very hesitant to make this post in the first place but I’m so glad I did. You guys have restored some of my faith in the world.**",solotravel,PandamaniumPoker

I'm solo traveling and decided to meet up with a fellow traveler from a group we are both in. We made plans to meet in the first city and travel to the second city together for 5 days, then continue from there until I return home in 2 weeks.

Well, it's been 3 days and I'm not really having fun with this particular person. I invited her to stay with me in the private room I already booked in City 2. I just got here, and she will be here in an hour. The plan was to stay 5 days and then pick a third city to go to. However, I want to stay in this city for longer than 5 days after all. But more than that, I'm ready to part ways with this person. I'd rather enjoy this city alone without her.

I don't know how to navigate this. She'll be here soon, and will be staying in my private room with me. She thinks we'll stay here 5 days then continue traveling together after. Since she only came to this city because of me, I'd be fine letting her stay here for a few days to see the city, but after that I want her to leave and go wherever she wants to go, and leave me here.

"Some thoughts on Eurail pass usage in FR, DE, Austria area. Seeking experiences in Benelux/Spain/Italy/Poland/Nordic countries","Germans are meticulous when checking Eurail passes, French people seem to mainly not give a fuck.

Things that you can get away on French trains but not on German trains:

- Booking an interrail reservation instead of a eurail reservation to get into the French trains where gates check the codes in big stations like Paris East
- Conductors that check your pass maybe 1 in 4 trains you take.
- Conductors that look at the cover of your pass and don't open it
- Conductors that look at the journeys of your pass rather than the ""X days"" on the top of the pass that really counts when you have a pass that is say, 10 days out of a month
- Conductors that look at your reservation without looking at your eurail pass
- Conductors that are cool when you give them a eurail pass but never check that you have a reservation

The Austrian version of that is similar to the German version but less intense. My hypothesis is that Germany is a bigger supporter of the train passes (unified EU/economy reasons) while France is less supportive. I am curious as to whether there are differences between countries I would lump in such categories: strict (Germany/Austria/Benelux area?) and relaxed (France, Spain, Italy)",solotravel,minGeselleChumetNiet

Traveling to Vienna from Lisbon. Covid test required?,"I booked a flight to Vienna from Lisbon but in the meantime it’s required to have a negative covid test, done 72h maximum before the flight.

“28 September: Travellers from Sweden no longer need a negative COVID-19 test to enter Austria. Travellers from Portugal now only need a negative test when arriving from Lisbon or the Norte region. “

So this mean only flights from the south are accepted without a test? 

In the Austrian website it reads that travelers from Portugal “do not have to present the medical certificate and are not subject to a quarantine if they can prove that they were not present in any other state than Austria and the states listed above within the last TEN days.”

[Report] 7 days in Catalunya after 4 months in Madrid (Sept 2019).,"A year ago, I took my first solo trip : a 7-days trip in Catalunya, Spain. Here's a report. It's been a year ago, so I might not remember every detail, sorry for that. 

I'll speak about my first days spent in Barcelona and how I managed to loose a friend there (F**k alcohol!). Then how I spent the rest of the days in different idylic little villages by myself, how I felt and how my feelings evolved. Also worth to say that end of september was a good period to go, as the weather was around the 25-30°C and there were not many tourists anymore (or at least outside of Barcelona).

Before going on that 7-days trip, I spent 4 months in Madrid for my work. This is not the main topic, but I'll write a few lines on it, because why not? I'll also use Madrid as point of comparison later. 

So, in May 2019 I was sent to Madrid for a 4 months mission to install the first Protontherapy center in Madrid. I really loved that city. The vibes, the architecture, the parks, ... really pleased me. I'd love to go back. I enjoyed it much more than Barcelona. 

There are so much things to see there, the Retiro Park with the Crystal Palace, the Prado Museum, all the nice buildings along Gran Via. If you can spend a few days there, I highly recommend.

The only thing I did not like so much there are the crowds and the heat. That goddammned heat. 47°C in full sun in july, still 36°C at 4am. Can't even go from one bar to another without getting all sweaty. 

Let's go to the Catalunya trip part now. 

BARCELONA
--------------

I spent the first 3 days in Barcelona. To reach it, I took a high speed train from Madrid, which lasted about 2hours and was fairly affordable. 

Once arrived there, I brought my stuff to the Airbnb I booked and went on to visit the city. Like everybody (I guess?), I visited the legacy of Antonio Gaudi, with the Güel Park (cheap entrance).
I then went to visit the gothic neighborhood. I really really liked it, but be sure to visit it during the day, as it's apparently not that safe when the sun goes down. 

On the first day, in the evening, I was meeting a girl-friend who was my colleague in my first job. She was there on holidays with her boyfriend who seems like a very nice guy. I had a crush a few years ago on that girl and was genuinly thinking it was from the past, but apparently alcohol decided otherwise. I apparently said stupid things, and she does not talk to me anymore. I'll pass you the details, but you can imagine that my trip was not off to a good start. 

The next day, I visited the Casa Balto (20€ entrance). The Casa Balto entrance fee is definitely not cheap, but it's worth it. This house is simply amazing. I originally did not want to pay that much but the friend saw the day before had convinced me to go and I'm glad I did. I recommend to also check the other Gaudi houses, even if only from outside, as they are quite grandiose. 

Unfortunately, I could not see the inside of the Sagrada Familia. The tickets need to be booked well in advance or you need to go early enough to have day-tickets (limited amount). 

The Barcelonetta beach is also quite nice, lots of little bars where you can take a drink or food and contemplate the sea. I was lucky enough that in the end of september there was not many tourists left, but the weather was still more than good. 

I also visited the Ciutadella park and a few markets.

Then on the last day,  I just walked around the city, feeling like I'd do whatever I liked and my feet took me to the Picasso Museum. Also really worth it, as you can discover the evolution of the life of the artist. It might actually surprise you. 

I then went on to Barcelona Airport to pick up a rental car to continue on my journey. 

Overall, I did not enjoy Barcelona that much. It sure is a beautifull city, as long as you stay in the touristic neighbourhood. As I said, I particularly like the Gothic quarter. But I feel like as soon as you step out of those areas, all the magic goes away. The appartement blocks are ugly and there's no charm whatsoever. It's just like any major city. Rush and disrespect. 

Here's the comparison I'll make with Madrid : Madrid, even though it has no beach (I have to concede, Barcelona is very cool for that point), feels much nicer. People feel nicer, and the Architecture is more developped (?!). I don't know if it's the good way to say it. But even far from the center, I still liked some of the traditional charm that spanish appartment blocks have. Even recently build blocks felt that way, where in Barca it just... didn't. 

Also, it's Catalunya and they are proud of it. They don't really like tourists nor Airbnb. They are not faking it and show it clearly with signs almost at every balcony. 


GIRONA
-------

After taking my rental car, I drove to Girona. For Games of Thrones fans, that's an interesting city. It was used to film some parts of Kings Landing and Braavos. 
It actually really feels like a medieval city. The Cathedral is purely grandiose, the Arab Bath are very interesting, the old Castle is beautifull and gives you a nice overview of the city. I loved those little streets, with paved floor where you can just walk with you eyes up and try to catch every detail you can from all the different houses and atmospheres you can feel there. 

I really recommend to go to Girona if you have time. I spent half a day there and enjoyed it a lot. Just take time to drink a Spritz (or whatever suits you) at the bottom of the steps of the cathedral, watch the other tourists just look at this impressive building. Wander in the little streets, cross the bridges and look at all those little houses that are short to fall into the water. 

Just be prepared, that's even more Catalunya than in Barcelona for the nationalism. But it sort of has its charm. 

BEGUR &amp; OTHER VILLAGES
------------------------------

At the end of my half-day in Girona, I took the car and headed to the Begur Area. I dropped my stuff at the hotel I booked. The Hostel Sa Barraca. This was a relatively cheap hotel but with very good value for money (60€/night I think). I especially recommend it for the hosts. It's an old couple, there super adorable. They speak a basic english and french. The breakfast was really nice, and the room very confortable (I had what I think was satin bedsheets, imagine my surprise!). Also, the sunrise there is absolutely stunning. You have a wonderful view on the sea from your room if you are lucky. If you have to pay a bit of extra to have it, just do it. There that holiday feeling when you wake up with the sunrising on the water, you know it's gonna be a good day. It wars your heart. I could just stay there, eating my breakfast and contemplate the scene that was offered to me. 

I stayed for the next 3 days in that Area. The village of Begur is nice. You can access the ruins of the castle  (different from the Castle itself) on foot via the nice little streets in the center of the village. There's quite a bit of history there, with houses inspired from Cuban architecture. 

The next day, I visited some of the most beautifull villages I've ever seen (except maybe this year in Northern Italy, but in a different style). 

If you like old and well preserved little medieval villages, I highly recommend Pals, Peratallada and Pubol. Peratallada was definitively my favorite. There was almost nobody there, but my god it's beautifull. So much peace, colorfull plants on every wall. I could just stay there for a while, thinking about nothing, just staying lost in time, as this village obviously is. 

You don't have to spend much time in those villages, as they are relatively small and close together. It took me half a day to do all three (starting from Begur at 8 am). 

During the afternoon, I drove to the cute little village of Sa Tuna. This is a gem that not many tourist know about. If you like tiny beaches, with crystal clear water, cute little white houses on the sea side and almost no tourist : go there! (also, the Spritz there is cheap...). I took a bit of time to chill on the beach, relax, read my book and I had a swim. After 4 months of very hard work, that's the first swim I had in the sea that summer. Such a wonderfull feeling. THAT, is holidays. Water was quite chilly so I did not stay long.

So, after that wonderfull swim, I took the road again and drove off to Llafranc and Callela Palafrugel (on the beach, not the town itself). Those are two other charming little villages, also with those typical white houses. I again let my feet take me wherever they wanted to. Those are sush beautifull little places ! If only my boss wouldn't have called me while I was peacefully reading my book on the beach to ask me to go somewhere I did not want to go on my return from holidays. I should have just shut my phone. That ruined my moment. But I consolated myselft with nice food after that, which was nice. Tapas, never enough tapas !

The last day was for Figueres and Cadaques. 
Those were on many lists of places to see. Well, Except for the Dali museum which is well worth it, don't spend more time in Figueres. It's nothing special and even food was not that great. 

I went on to Cadaques, which in contrary to Figueres, is absolutely worth it! It's a bit like the other sea side villages with white houses, but slightly bigger. Slightly more narrow streets, more nature. I really enjoyed it. Just stop for an instant, take an ice cream, sit on the edge of the wall above the water, and relax. Look at the sea and do a bit of tourist watching, which can sometimes be fun. 

There also a tiny Dali museum there, but it's not really worth it. I encourage you to just walk at random in the streets and enjoy the vibe. 

In the evening, I took the car back to my hotel, to have a good night of sleep as I had to wake up quite early for quite a special day. 

HOT AIR BALLOON TRIP
--------------------------

I woke up very early as I had to be at 6.30 at the Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica de la Garrotxa. Why so early? I'm glad you asked! 

Today is the day I was taking a hot air balloon trip over this former volcanic region. They ask you to arrive this early, simply to enjoy climbing in altitude with the sun rising. That was, in my humble opinion, one if not the most epic scene I've ever witnessed. This is absolutely stunning. Imagine one moment. You are in complete darkness. In almost complete silence (except the burner from the hot air balloon breaking it from time to time, but it also warms you up so it's actually appreciated! Also, 3m tall flames are kinda cool.), you are rising above the floor. As you climb up above ground,  far far away, you notice the first slim lights of the day, but they don't reach you yet. 

As you continue climbing up, and the light from the sun is slowly growing, you notice a slight white-ish pellicule of fog sticking to the ground. Only the little hills from the volcanic past of the region are pointing their nose through those tiny clouds. The lights are amplificating. It bounces on the hills and the fog, with a nice and warming orange halo. You are still in silence. Everyone of the 10 people on board is totaly silent and contemplates the beauty of Mother Nature in front of us. Trust me, I have tears coming up my eyes while rememoring this. 

Then, when the sun is up, the pilot of the hot air balloon starts unpacking the ""breakfast"". A glass of champagne and catalan cake. I usually say no to alcohol before noon, but I figured ""oh well, if not now in the magical theatre, when?"". 

Then, he gives you explanations of what's happening, where you are, how to drive that big balloon, and how to land it. He also tells you that depending on the wind, you may or may not go very far. 

It lasted a total of 1h30-ish, of pure contemplation and pure magic. After you land, two 4X4 are coming to pick you up, and the staff kindly asks you to give them a hand to fold the housing of the balloon that has now deflated and lies on the ground like a dead monster. 

Once you do that, they bring you back to the center where you took of from, they round you around a table with everyone that was on board with you and they serve you a true feast! Gosh, I thougt I was gonna explode after so much delicious catalan food! 

After a good hour of eating and listening to stories of the guides, it was time to go and visit the last villages before heading to the airport and go home the next day. Just FYI, I think the hot air balloon trip + the food was a package and costed about 230€ all included. Seems expensive, but well worth it. Once again, the area and the scene were just epic !!! 


LAST HALF DAY
-----------------

During my last afternoon, I visited a few places &amp; villages that were left on my list. I first started by going into a forest not that far from where I did the hot air balloon trip. This area is full of gorges but I unfortunately did not have enough time to do them all. So, I did go to the Gorg del Molí dels Murris. It's a bit less impressive than on many pictures of the internet, especially because there was less water at that time. But I was there for a good 45 minutes, I just sat on the floor and I let any thoughts flow and go, trying not to focus on anything particular. Maybe it was meditation, I don't know, never done that. This felt good and that's all that matters. 

Next, I went to Castlefollit de la roca. Internet pictures are showing a tiny and cute village on the edge of a cliff. Sure, from afar, it's impressing. The village itselft, not so much. I just found it quite ugly, not that interesting and dirty. I think I spent 20 minutes there, then left. I stopped with my car on the way to Besalu as I had the view on Castelfollit on its cliff, which was more interesting. 

Last village I did was Besalu. Really recommend it. You can't miss the old-stone bridge, and the narrow medieval streets of that village. It's worth it to go there if you have time. But don't plan too much as an hour or two are more than enough. Also, don't eat there. I could not find a single restaurant that looked like it was really worth it. 

Which brings me to the very last place I visited during my stay : Olot. If you look on a map, it's true, it's close to where I took the hot air balloon trip, but I my hotel was also there, so it makes sense. I walked around the city for a bit. It's a nice little town and I saw it from above during the hot air balloon trip and it had a nicely shaped form for a city. There's nothing that exceptional about it.  then headed to a tapas restaurant. Then I headed for the last hostel room, which was a nightmare (did not check before, but it was above a bar). Luckily, my night was meant to be short as I had to drive to the airport to be there at 8 in the morning. 

This conclude my report on the trip itself.


MENTAL STATE
----------------

As I mentionned in the beginning of this report, this trip took place directly after very intensive 4 months of work in Madrid. I was truly exhausted both physically and mentally and definitely needed a break. I was slightly afraid of going alone on holidays as it was my first time doing so. I often travel alone for work, but this was different. I did not know what to expect. 

If you've read everything, you'll know by now that my first day of the trip did no go that well, with me loosing a friend (Linea, if you read this... I'm sorry again). Luckily for me (or not), I've had enough drawbacks in my life to be able to go over this quickly enough for the duration of my stay. I'll worry about this when I'll be home. 
The rest of the trip went fine. I sometimes did not really know what to do, I had change of mind regarding what I wanted to see or visit, where to eat. Would the restaurant accept only one person ?(they usually did). 

I discovered that I enjoyed beeing alone with myself, even if sometimes I was missing one or two of my friends in particular. 
I could indeed just do whatever I wanted, just let my feet take me where they wanted. Not get out of bed in the morning if I did not want to. 

This was a good occasion also to reflect on myselft. I haven't discovered anything I did not know, but I kinda understood more of what I already knew. 

I just regret not turning my phone off and checking my professional emails during my stay. I should learn to leave work aside to truly enjoy the break.

CONCLUSION
---------------

I liked my first solo trip. I understood a bit more about me. I prefer Madrid to Barcelona. I loved the Begur Area and the  Garrotxa park. 

I liked it so much that I did it again this year, in Northern Italy. You can probably find my report from mid-september under ""7 days in northern Italy"" somewhere in the posts below. 

Enjoy the reading, and if you have questions, feel free to ask. 

Cheers!

I have never traveled solo before! I am planning my first solo road trip. How is my plan so far?,"what’s up everybody! 

i’m 23 years old, and i haven’t been out of town in over a year and i have been saving all my 1’s and coins for a year now and i have a pretty good amount of cash saved up. i want to take a lone road trip next month, and i have never went on a long trip alone before. i live in central illinois, and i want to go to yosemite! i also want to stop by pikes peak on the way. 
i’m starting all this planning by creating my route and breaking it up into 8-10 hour stretches of driving. from where i live, my maps app tells me it will take 27 hours to drive to yosemite. i will only be able to have 8 days to make this trip happen. 
i have sundays and monday’s off from work, and i’m going to take 1 week off for this trip. i’m planning on leaving work on a saturday to shower and put my things in my car and leave around 1am just to get a start, and i will probably find a rest stop 2-3 hours out to get a nap in my car since i will be pretty tired after working 13 hours that day. that way i can just get the first few hours out of the way and get a head start.

day 1:
my first stop would be in denver, which is about 14 hours from where i live. i’m thinking i’m going to get a hotel there to rest up and i’m going to leave in the morning to pikes peak. 

day2:
it will be around 2 hours to get to the summit of pikes peak from denver, in which i’ll spend maybe 2-3 hours at. then i plan on making my way towards fresno from pikes peak.
i’m not sure which places to stop at to get sleep on the way to fresno, but i’m guessing i could make it about 11 hours and get a hotel room in saint george, utah. 

day 3:
wake up in saint george, and head towards fresno. this stretch would be about 7.5-8 hours. i will be going through las vegas on the way. i don’t have time to visit there, but i do want to get a picture at the famous welcome sign. 
when i get to fresno, i’m going to find a hotel and settle in. i’ll have a few hours to kill so i might just find a cool spot to eat, or grab a drink somewhere.

day 4:
this is the day i get to see what i ventured for! i’m going up to yosemite to spend the day. after this i am unsure if i should stay in fresno one more night to spend more time at yosemite, or start making my way back home afterwards. 

who has been to yosemite before? should i spend two days there?

a) i leave yosemite towards salt lake city, and stay somewhere in nevada over night on the way there. perhaps hawthorne, nevada which is 6.5-7 hours from yosemite. 
b) i drive back to fresno to stay another night.

day 5a:
i leave hawthorne, nevada in the morning to drive about 7.5-8 hours to salt lake city. coming from this way, i’ll get to drive through the salt flats. i’ve always wanted to see the salt flats in person. i’ll hang out in salt lake city for the night and rest there. 
day5b:
go to yosemite again the second day in a row, spend some hours there again, and then leave towards hawthorne, nevada to rest for the night.

day6a: 
check out salt lake city for the morning, find a nice spot to get some lunch, and then get on the road and drive 9.5 hours to north platte, nebraska to rest. 
day6b: 
drive to salt lake city to hang for the night.

day7a:
get on the road again to drive the last 9 or so hours home in illinois. i’ll get to look through all my pictures and unpack and get some rest before going back to work the next day. although, i only work 4 hours the first work day after this trip. 
day7b: head from salt lake to north platte, nebraska.

day 8b:
head from nebraska to home in illinois to get to bed and wrap up my vacation. 


how does this plan sound? does anyone know of any better ways to split up each stretch of driving? does anyone have any tips for someone traveling solo for on a long road trip like this for the first time? is there anything i should know about pikes peak or yosemite or salt lake city prior to visiting? 

thanks guys!!!

edit:
thanks for the input guys! creating a plan for this trip is so much fun, and i am really looking forward to this trip. 

i have decided that i am going post pone my trip until february/march. this will give me more time to plan and prepare. also, november might not be the best time to try and go up pikes peak, or drive through the high sierras lol. 

i am moving to chicago in march with two close friends, so i am going to plan to make this trip then. when i leave my current job, i am going to take two weeks to go on this trip before i start my new job in chicago. this way, i won’t have to feel any guilt from my current employers for taking two weeks off for myself. i know that i can get a week off, but i think asking for two would be pushing it. if i start a new job, i don’t think it would be right to take two weeks off for a long time, so i think it’s best to take this trip in between jobs. 
until then, i think i am going to just ask for two days off next month to make a 4 day weekend, and take a little solo trip up to the upper peninsula in northern wisconsin. my dad told me that it’s about a 6-7 hour drive, it’s touristy and scenic, and there was a lot of people my age around when he was there. at first that idea didn’t sound anywhere near as exciting as going to yosemite, because i’ve lived in illinois most my life and i was never too thrilled when i have visited wisconsin before. but i’ve never really been to the parks up there, so after thinking about it i think that does sound like a good idea. 

i think it will give me a taste of the solo travel and might prepare me more for my longer road trip i’m planning in the spring. it also won’t be expensive either. i want to check out the scenic spots at devils lake, and i want to hike around the apostle islands. 
not only that, but i’ll be able to get a case of that famous new glarus spotted cow to bring home! i don’t get to drink a spotted cow very often, but it can only be bought in wisconsin. where i live, everybody loves that stuff because it’s a treat you can’t have very often. whenever friends go up to wisconsin to visit, they always take orders for their friends and family and bring back spotted cows for everyone back home. if you’re unfamiliar, spotted cow is just a farmhouse style ale. we love it here in central illinois.
again, thanks for the replies! i’m very excited to plan this mini wisconsin trip and take my first official solo trip. 

have any of you traveled wisconsin? have any of you been to devils lake or the apostle islands? if so, how was it? are there any other places worth seeing in wisconsin?",solotravel,HoldenDarko

Met a suitable one while traveling,"During September 2019, I decided to bagpack across Europe as a graduation treat. It was a 2 month trip with no prior planning. While my time in Germany, someone in my hostel suggested me to try out paragliding in interlaken. I googled it and found it quite amusing. So while I was traveling from Frankfurt to Bern, I saw a girl in my train. I started a small talk with her and soon we both found each other truly interesting and started having longer conversations about ourselves. When we reached Bern, I told her that didn't make any hostel bookings and would be leaving for Interlaken 2 days after. She asked me if I wanna make a booking in the hostel she was staying in to which I agreed. We connected to greater extent through the conversations we were having. While traveling the old city, the only thing in my mind was to make a move and kiss her. I think she was thinking the same. We spent the whole night across a lonely sight across the Aare river. We talked about life and had some deep talks. I made a move and we had sex in the open. 

After 2 days, she agreed to travel with me to interlaken. After spending a fun day in interlaken, we came back to bern, from where she had to leave for france. We were extremely sad to leave each other that day and had a perfect make out at the train station. We exchanged our snapchats and said goodbyes 👋. 

Since then we have been connected through social media and have came even closer to each other. No I think she's is the one I always have been looking for. I'm thinking to propose her soon.",solotravel,[deleted]
"(Oregon, U.S.) Looking to do some solo traveling around Oregon. I have about a week to explore and would love to soak in the fall colors and crisp air while I can.

I’ve camped in Tillamook, cape disappointment, and Detroit lake and those were amazing as well. 

I’m thinking of checking out national parks if I can such as Crater lake, Olympic (in Washington) and maybe mt Rainier. 

I was going to hike the timberline trail with some friends but with the fires and wind as of now there’s a section that’s partially damaged and pretty difficult. My friends don’t want to do it so we’re camping elsewhere in the meantime, but I’d love to get some good hikes in soon while I can. 

Whether it’s camping or hiking or just exploring a secret gem of a state park, (or even something else entirely!) I just want to explore this beautiful state while I’m here during the prime fall time. 
Any recommendations are highly appreciated. Thanks to anyone who has some suggestions! 
Much love and your state is beautiful. But you PNW folk already know that.

isla holbox one of the last,"I had been eyeing Isla Holbox ever sense I did a roadtrip in the area, and it was exactly what I hoped for. A gritty but refined get lost kind  of an escape option in Covid times. And not for everyone which is what keeps it what it is. I  had thoughts of ""The Mosquito Coast"", an old Harrison Ford film on this  trip. As with any place you can find like this, it wont be long before  it changes. As for now, humbly enjoy an unforgettable experience.

First  things first: travel light, grab bug spray and exchange for some pesos.  Then wrap your head around getting to the island from the airport. You  could hire a quick prop plane ride, drive or shuttle. For most, a  shuttle does the trick and provides you with a perspective of the  undeveloped area outside of Cancun. A scheduled time shuttle is a very  reasonable price or you can pay double for a private ride. My suggestion  is to use the private ride to get there because the fair includes  shuttle, boat ride and cart taxi to your hotel. Now that you've had the  guided walk through you'll see how simple it is to return on your own  with a scheduled shuttle. This is a 2hr drive so if arriving into Cancun  later just stay at one of the close hotel options. Next morning you can  have your private ride arranged from the hotel or shuttle back to the  airport for a scheduled shuttle time.

[isla holbox](https://preview.redd.it/fknbr5ba3pr51.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc3529ca08d119836d3ab49df51a0da59a9635f8)

If driving through  undeveloped countryside, then taking a boat ride to arrive on a  primitively refined island sounds like your taste, you've just nailed  it. So now where to stay. After back-and-forth debating I decided on  Tierra del Mar. Bingo. What you have here is the perfect scenario for a  visit to the island: value, location and a peaceful size. Its a highly  maintained minimalist hotel (more of a bnb) with only 6 rooms with  patios, a small zen courtyard, pool and breakfast area. And just outside  the courtyard doors you have immediate access to the vibrant pleasure  of the primitive town and all its character. Not to mention the beach of  course is just an ally away. This as opposed to an upscale stay on the  beach made more sense to fully absorb the personality of the island. And  that's really how it felt.

Regardless of what you decide  everything is walking distance or a quick cart taxi away. After the trek  to get here, then quickly checking in and dropping your bags, all you  want to do is walk along the amazing waterfront. White sand, pond-calm  mint green water and knee deep for a couple hundred feet. Its so eye  catching that cloudy days are even more beautiful then blue sky because  the grays, blue and mint green is another worldly sight. Sooner or later  you'll decide to sit down with your feet up and grab some seafood for  lunch at Raices. I had the best sweet-spicy octopus ceviche salad  concoction I've ever eaten. And washed it down with a marg on the rocks.  Then carried on north to the end to get my bearings for several spots  for diner and drinks later on in the trip.

After that I was ready  to return to the quiet sanctuary of the hotel. Pool time with a  refreshment until dinner. There's a market just steps away for the  essentials. That evening I began with my first dinner at Zapata. A hand  crafted cave just right off the street with no flooring. The perfect  ambiance and grilled fish dinner to start and end the first day. Night  cap back at the pool and called it a day. The next morning I awoke to  the quiet and newly manicured zen of the small courtyard from my patio.  An assortment of breakfast options, and most importantly coffee, is  awaiting every morning at 8am. Perfecto. I took my time that morning  before heading, now south, along the coastline to the end. Honestly one  of the most unforgettable beach walks you'll ever have. The perfect  blend of natural beach beauty combined with sections of dilapidated  colorful structures. And again best seen cloudy for contrast.

Its  about 2-3hrs of walking once you get back to the hotel so pool time  once again before dinner. Refreshment in hand again--of course. After a  great couple hours relaxing at the pool it was time to get ready for  din. A much anticipated steak night at the rooftop of Parrilla de Juan. A  nice little walk through the town square to a colorfully tiled  staircase leading above to steak heaven. One of the best flavor of meat,  no sauce, I've had. And perfectly paired to savor with an Old Fashion  to wash down. Take your time here. Enjoy every bite and the open rooftop  evening. And with that back to a night cap at the pool and called it a  night. Boat day in the morning.

Another perfectly manicured  courtyard step over to breakfast and coffee. The quiet minimalist  mornings here are calming and very enjoyed. Especially being the last  morning to enjoy. The cart taxi would be arriving soon for my boat  excursion for the day. I could have simply walked to the beachfront and  hired the excursion myself but the prices are so reasonable even booking  through the hotel is shocking. (Speaking of price, it really should be  noted how great of a value this island visit it. It's very very  reasonable. To get the best pricing for smaller business make sure to  have pesos. For the fancier drinks and dinner spots at hotels a CC is  fine.) For the excursion I went with the multi island tour. Nothing  really note worthy except the sandbar stop, which is worth it alone.  Other than that its just a great day out on the mint green waters.

Before  relaxing back at the pool for my last day I wanted to grab some tacos  street side. So I popped over to Barba Negra for an assortment of taco  offers. Its everything you'd be looking for: good vibes, great drinks  and mouthwatering tacos. From there I was set for my last time by the  pool and the big decision. The last night dinner choice along with a  comfortable shirt and my slip ons.  There's a couple choices best for this that end on a fancier note. And  to be upfront, honest and fair I didn't make the right choice. I wanted  to end with sushi to enjoy the fresh option that seems no-brainer. I  went with, what was highly recommended, Tamashi Sky Bar. Unfortunately,  being the Covid situation the dinner area was really just a pool area,  its back off the beach and the sushi was just ok. My suggestion is to  end with dinner on the water at Casa Las Tortugas or Las Nubes. Both are  the finer hotel options on the island and offer a very scenic dinner  experience on the water.

But hey, no complaints the evening was  still very enjoyed and ended with a last night cap back at the pool. The  next morning I awoke early and enjoyed the short walk back to the ferry  terminal. A last gritty and quiet pleasure that will be remembered  forever. The few early streetside vendors preparing coffee and juices  and tortilla shops long at work already. Then on to your last ferry  ride, on the top open deck, to ponder what you've just experienced. The  perfect blend of primitive and refined option with the energy of one of  your favorite tropical adventure films. The 7:15am shuttle will be  awaiting for your ride back to the airport. Enjoy.

Pro Tip: Have  pesos on you for your beach walks, there's several stops to grab a  refreshment. Hagel at the beach with the vendors for your boat day,  especially with a group. Do grab a dinner night at Luuma. And consider  trying different hotels, especially for the last evening along with  dinner.",solotravel,_buoyed_

My solo trip to Berlin during a pandemic,"I just got back from a weekend trip to Berlin from Venice. I'm a 23 years old girl.

While the airport was almost empty and i encountered no queues, my ryanair flight was packed, but everyone was wearing masks and using hand sanitizers. 

I arrived to Shonefeld on friday and took the covid test immediatly. It wasn't mandatory but i took it anyway. I'd rather be safe than sorry. There was only a five minute queue to get it. I got my results through the app, the same evening.

Got to my hotel by using the S-bahn which was almost empty.

I than took a walk around the city. By german law you are not required to keep your masks outside, but i wore mine all the time, even when i was alone. I noticed that germans do not like to wear masks, wheather it was outside, and someone even didn't wore it inside places.

The only ones who where wearing masks where tourists from other countries.

The next day i took a free walking tour. We wore masks and keep 1.5 meters apart between each other, and we were a small group anyway. All the attractions visited were outside.

On sunday i took a tour to Sachsenhausen, a concentration camp. This one was really sad but really interesting. All partecipants respected the social distancing rules.

I didn't eat at restaurants, i only eat take away in my room to be safe and wore gloves when taking my food. 

Before leaving monday i took another covid test at the airport.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we should travel, to an extent. the guides i spoke to where almost moved to tears that somebody showed up for the tour, because us travelling is the only reason they have a job and can provide food for their families. 

If you travel, be careful, wear a mask, take covid tests if you can. And of course check the rules of your country and the country you want to travel to. Safety is always the priority.

Are there any places in America that I should avoid/stray towards as a black British traveller?,"I've been wanting to travel to the US for a long time, and I've heard that there are many places that are less safe than others, on account of gang activity and racism among police/citizens.

I am mixed Caribbean/Welsh, with facial piercings and pec-length dreadlocks, in case that makes any difference.

I'm also a short guy, at 5'6"", in case that also makes any difference (in terms of maybe being more or less imposing to the general public and police officers)

Thanks, I hope to be able to select a perfect US destination soon &lt;3


Edit: For context, I come from Cardiff, which, as a former Port City, is one of the most diverse cities in the UK.  The city can, however, be dangerous, and knowing what's what and who's who goes a long way over here.  Racism, however, isn’t that big of a deal here, at least in my experience, and what racist experiences I have had here are mostly just kids being retarded, or people with genuinely decent intentions coming out with kinda dodgy questions/statements.

Edit 2: For the most part, I'm not really worried about racism among the public, and am more worried about areas in which being black could get me shot, for example (going off of what I've heard/read of course) That's not to say that i want to visit a fully bigoted, Southern stereotype kind of area, but as a person, as long as it's only an annoyance and not a danger, racism doesn't really bother me all that much, provided I am safe.",solotravel,chickentoast26

"Covid cancelled my trip, looking for advice and recommendations","So I planned my very first international trip for November 3-25, and it happened to be to a bunch of countries I can no longer get into. I have this time off from work and I don't really want to waste it so I'm looking for advice for last minute travel to somewhere letting Americans in. IDK if I should look for some kind of guided trips, like from Intrepid travel, or just make something up on my own at this point. Also Intrepid and Quark are the only companies I know about, can anyone recommend others to look at? What places should I look into going? 

I don't want to have to quarantine after arrival because that would waste most of my trip. I already got Covid in April so I'm not worried about getting it myself, but I also don't know if activities will be shut down or not. I'm out of shape and not looking to do any kind of intense physically active travelling, something more like a casual city I can explore at my own pace. Thanks for any advice.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your advice. I'd also like to say I got covid from working as a nurse in a covid unit, so I am well versed in the subject. When I say I don't worry about it, it doesn't mean that I plan on not following any precautions, because I do and will continue to do so.",solotravel,DietRainbows
"Trip to Munich, Berlin, Prague, and Krakow - Advice needed","Hi, in mid-late October I'm thinking of doing a 14 day trip to Munich, Berlin, Prague, and maybe Krakow if I can squeeze it in. I'm currently from Canada which, for now, is allowed unrestricted entry into these countries. This is my first trip to Europe so I might have to move slower due to my inexperience.

I know a more common first Central/Eastern Europe trip is Prague, Budapest, Vienna, but both Vienna and Budapest aren't allowing visitors from Canada

Going into Prague first would mean I can't go into Germany due to Covid restrictions, so I think I'll have to start with Germany.

I'd appreciate some advice on whether this rough schedule would work given my interests.

**Interests**:

\- Beautiful sights like Neuschwanstein Castle, the Alps, Prague Castle, Salt Mines- Museums- History- Trying new food

I've roughly allocated 3 days to each place since the 10h flight from Canada to Berlin will happen on Day 1 and the return flight from Krakow to Canada.

**Day 1-4: Berlin**

\- 10h flight to Berlin

\- Take the Deutsche Bahn to Munich on last day (\~5 hours)

**Day 5-8 Munich**

\- Day trip to the Bavarian Alps

\- \~5 hour train ride to Prague

**Day 8-11 Prague**

\- Either 9 hour train ride or 1 hour flight to Krakow

**Day 11-14 Krakow**

\- If time permits, would like to check out the Aushwitz Memorial

\- Fly back to Canada on last day (10h+ flight)

&amp;#x200B;

Is this enough time in each place? If I really need to, I don't mind eliminating one of these locations so I can have more time to enjoy the rest without being rushed and stressed out.",solotravel,LookedIntoTheAbyss
My best friend tainted the last European trip we took. Would I be wrong to tell her I want to travel alone from now on?,"About two years ago I traveled to Europe for a week with my best friend and could not believe how horrible she acted. We stopped at a fast food restaurant on the way to the airport and she made a comment about how the worker should be in college and not working there. At the airport, we ran into someone we went to high school with and she laughed at him for working there and having to watch us take a trip to Spain. When we got there, she was extremely controlling, talked down to me and others regularly, barely wanted to go anywhere or do anything while on the trip, and had a micromanaging attitude 80% of the time. While I still managed to have a great trip and found a new obsession with traveling, I didn’t have fun with her. I had fun in spite of her. 

When we got back home we didn’t speak for months. She later apologized to me and said that she realized whenever she feels insecure or bad about herself she treats others badly to feel better about herself. I’ve forgiven her and I still consider her my best friend, but I later found out she told the rest of our friend group that while she can be very “motherly”, I was the one who was “stubborn” and didn’t want to do or try anything new. THIS coming from someone who didn’t want to go to any main attractions, sites or events and wanted to go to the same cafe every day. To me, that was her way of not taking full responsibility for her actions. I decided after that I will never travel with her again and travel solo going forward. Recently, our friends group started planning a trip for when covid dies down. I’ve made it clear that I won’t be going and while I haven’t said it outright, they all know it’s because she’s going too. They said I should move past it and give her a second chance but I refuse because I know how bad she acted. I truly love her and we are still best friends, but I’ve decided not to let her taint another trip for me. Am I wrong for that?",solotravel,YoYoheel73

How far does 18k USD get me in 2021-2022?,"I plan on traveling from May 2021 to August 2022.  By that time I will have saved $18k.  

Given the way this pandemic is going (assuming borders open, it is safe, or there's a vaccine, etc.), I plan to travel in the U.S. and Canada to mostly national parks or outdoor recreational areas from May-October.  I have recently converted a minivan into a camper, so that would get me ~20 mpg and a place to stay each night.  If the pandemic lifts a bit, then I will probably explore some cities for no more than a couple days at a time too.

Based on how this pandemic is going, I would probably head to SE Asia in October 2021 and jump around until around February 2022.  I know this is vague....but I honestly wouldn't plan much more other than a one-way ticket.

February 2022 I will hopefully ski out west in the U.S. for 3-4 weeks or so (ski passes ~$800).

By the time March 2022 comes, *hopefully* Latin America is cleared up from the pandemic and I can travel starting from Mexico City and make may way to Colombia.  Latin America is one of my favorite regions, so if the pandemic clears up quicker than expected there, then I would probably skip SE Asia and double my time there!

I know this is extremely vague and very variable, but I'm just trying to day dream about life after uni and push off studying for my exam that I have coming up later.  Does this sound feasible on $18k if I live frugally?  I also plan to get an airlines credit card that should get me a couple round-trip tickets from the sign-up bonus.",solotravel,you_dub_englishman
Traveling solo again at 69 and every day has been a joy,"I backpacked in Europe a few times as a young man, taking overnight trains to save on lodging, occasionally rolling out my mat on the floor of the train because there were no empty seats.  I traveled without any advance reservations for lodging, and no firm itinerary.  Upon arriving in each new city, I would stash my stuff in a locker or bag check window at the train station, and search for a pension or hostel on foot, then return later to retrieve my pack.  It was easy to meet other travelers my age and join up for a few days when we were going to the same cities.  I moved every few days, visited a lot of places, and had wonderful experiences.

As a new retiree and single, I yearned to travel abroad again but worried if I could manage it solo, feared it would be difficult to meet people, had concerns about health care abroad, and didn’t think I would fit in at hostels.  This time around I wanted to stay in each place for a week or more and explore deeper, at a more relaxed pace.  I also wanted more privacy and comfort than my hostel provided 40 years ago, and expenses were less of an issue (my first trip to Europe was on a student loan; the government &amp; banks didn’t  send the money directly to the college back then and I knew I would not get enough time off for a long trip once I started my career.  I had no money so I borrowed 2k and spent it all on a 5-week trip, knowing I could repay the loan once I graduated and got a job).

For my first “test trip” post-retirement, I decided on a  month long visit to Argentina and Uruguay.  Before leaving the US, I booked a studio apt for a week in Buenos Aires and an inexpensive hotel for a week in Montevideo, but left myself an open itinerary for the last 2+ weeks.  I heard good things from locals about the lake region of Argentina and decided to go, booking a studio apt in Bariloche for a week.  

I had a wonderful time and managed to deal with the curve balls that were thrown at me traveling alone in countries where I didn’t speak the language, such as a mrsa infection in my knee that required two weeks of 2 strong antibiotics.  Treatment at an ER was prompt, professional and free!  

But didn’t meet many people other than the managers of the properties where I stayed.  So when I returned to Buenos Aires for a week before my flight home, I decided to try a hostel again.  I got a single room rather than a dorm (I use a CPAP machine for sleep apnea, which can annoy others, and I need quiet to sleep well).  It was a very small and basic room but I quickly met a couple of young guys newly arrived from Germany, over a beer in the common area.  We hit it off and I felt right at home.  I concluded that both solo travel and hostels were still great at age 69.

Six months later I left for a month-long, solo trip to Berlin, Krakow, and Budapest, staying at hostels and a YMCA.  I had a blast and enjoyed the hostel experience.  They were mostly much nicer than in my youth, and I always chose well-located ones with good access to public transport.  They were often in “hipster” neighborhoods with lots of activity and youthful energy.  I was always able to get a private room at a good price.  My step tracker app reported that I walked an average of 13 miles per day, far more than was my custom at home.  Every day was a joy.    

Afterward, I reflected on what enabled me to feel such joy even with the occasional panic-arousing catastrophe, such as getting pickpocketed in Berlin my 2nd day.  I noted two big differences from my life at home.  First, I did not watch TV much at all because even when I had access, I could not understand the language and I preferred to be out exploring and eating.  At home, I was use to watching TV at every meal and in the evening, but the political news often got me riled or depressed, and the commercials often seemed annoying, manipulative and dishonest.  

The most salient difference though, was the fun I had taking pictures everywhere.  This involved exploring with curiosity and focusing on things that were interesting or beautiful while framing out the boring and the ugly, then editing and sharing them with friends back home.  This has become a metaphor for my life today.  I look for the beautiful and the good, and try to avoid focusing on anything else.  It makes me feel joyful.  There are plenty of things wrong with the world, and plenty of great things too.  Whether I focus on the bad stuff or the good stuff, the world  remains the same, but I don’t.  The more I practice looking for beauty and goodness, while avoiding ruminating on things that make me angry, confrontational or sad, the better I feel.  It’s a bit selfish really, but I choose to act in ways that make me feel good.  When I feel joyous, I act better.  People seem to respond positively to this, and if my being kind, humble, generous, and friendly brings others some good feelings too, that’s great, it’s a win-win.  But mostly I do it for me. 😎

"Solo road trip out west, advice on route and itinerary.","So I'm planning on a road trip out to Montana/Wyoming for the middle/end of next June. Starting from Minneapolis, driving to Glacier NP, then staying in Bozeman for a 2 nights. On my first full day in Bozeman, I planned on doing a day trip down to Yellowstone via US-191, US-20, and Grand Loop Rd in Yellowstone before heading back to Bozeman. Then the next day doing the Beartooth Highway (stopping at vistas and possibly the summer ski area off that road) on my way to stay in Greybull. Then Rapid City on US-14 with a detour to Devil's Tower, then the next morning back to MPLS.

I want to incorporate Grand Teton NP into this somehow, but I don't want to have to spend another night somewhere. What I considered is going through Yellowstone on US-191 on my first day, hitting Teton as well afterwards, then back to Bozeman. This would let me hit both of them, but I would be spending 8 and a half hours on the road that day. Which isn't a problem in itself, but if I'm going to these amazing places I don't want to be in my car all day. The next day I would go from Bozeman to Greybull on US-212, but take a detour to see the Yellowstone Canyon, And try to go skiing. This is another 8 hour drive.

Does anyone have suggestions on this? Other things to do along this route? Or other places to stay in WY on a budget? I looked at a map and say Greybull was about halfway between Bozeman and Rapid City, so that's why I picked it.

Edit: Thanks to some suggestions, I think I'm going to only do 1 night in Bozeman, and instead stay closer to Yellowstone the next night. It's also becoming apparent that I will need to add an additional day to my trip if I want to hit Teton too.",solotravel,NormanQuacks345

Is Paris worth it?,"Paris has always been one of my top destinations but recently I've been feeling uncertain about it. I actually usually avoid cities, I really dislike modern buildings and crowds of people but I love old buildings and architecture and art and the whole atmosphere of an old city like Paris. But one of my first doubts was when one of my online friends was raving about how much they wanted to see London for it's old buildings and such, and it hit me that I've been to London a million times and it's terrible (in my opinion). The amount of modern buildings and shops swamp the old stuff and anything worth seeing is surrounded by trashy new stuff. I thought to myself, if I'd never been to London, I'd probably see it as some fantasy version too, and is that the same way I'm seeing Paris in my mind? The only city I can really think of that pretty much meets expectations is Edinburgh, but even then nowadays it's overrun with tacky tourist giftshops.

Another friend of mine who lived in France for several years as a kid said she took a trip to Paris and said it was really dirty and full of litter and overall unpleasant. She didn't make it sound like the romantic, gothic city I have in my head. But she might have been viewing it through a different lense, she doesn't really care for old architecture or anything like that. I know it will be touristy to some degree, of course it will, but I'm not sure the extent or how much of Paris is actually lovely old buildings and streets and how much is office buildings and tescos. Was anyone dissapointed by Paris?

"To those who have quit their jobs to travel for a long time, How did it affect your career?","I'm 27 now and I've been dreaming of spending a year going through Central and South America. I really feel like I'm wasting my 20's working. ""Youth is wasted on the young"" right? 

The thing is, I already did the ""gap year"" thing after I graduated. One year teaching English and another 6 months travelling. My career is already roughly two years behind and pretty inexperienced. So I feel as if I'm being greedy. My job right now is kind of mediocre, I don't enjoy it and am actively looking to move for a raise/better title. 

I've got plenty of money to do a trip, but not enough for a deposit on a house. Property is expensive in my city (and only going up) but still achievable. My friends are buying houses now and I could as well in a couple of years if I don't travel. Right now I just invest my excess money. If I sell my car and use the liquid cash I always have, that should be enough for the whole year and I won't need to touch any of my stocks. 

I work in the tech industry. In my country (Australia), It's doesn't pay as well as the USA, but it's still decent and the demand for jobs is high-ish. I just want to know if there are other people who were roughly in my situation. I also understand this will be a heavily biased sub. 

Right now my plan is to get my career into a better position, one more job potentially two. Then at 29 (18 months away), I just need to go and do it while I've still got some of my 20's left. 

Any advice, anecdotes you guys can share? I understand this sub will be a little biased.",solotravel,Spamsational

That being said, I've never biked anywhere while traveling, and I suspect there are many challenges to it, but I'm very interested and I think it would be an incredible personal achievement worth the trouble.

My #1 travel advice: Wake up early,"I really don't like being in crowds, and I'm guessing most of you don't either.  The easiest way to avoid crowds is just to wake up early.  

You can have a very leisurely morning breakfast, go for a nice long walk alone in a very picturesque neighborhood or park, go see some usually-crowded sights, and then have an early lunch when restaurants aren't busy and the food is freshest. I'm also self-conscious when eating alone in most busy restaurants, but I don't care at all when there's hardly anyone else eating.  

I just saw a post in r/travel where someone said it's impossible to avoid pictures with ridiculous crowds at the Great Wall of China.  Well, I just woke up early, and walked nearly the entire public section of Mutianyu very leisurely before anyone else showed up except a couple vendors setting up for the day.  https://imgur.com/gallery/mTiiYYg

Then I often take a break in the early afternoon when everyone else is crowding transit and cafes and restaurants and shops and sights and cool neighborhoods -- eg, laying in a park, the beach, back in my room doing some planning, hostel common area, etc.  Then in late afternoon/early evening I like to visit places that opened later and have usually slowed down -- shops, teahouses, cafes, markets, art galleries, etc.  Then again, have an early dinner while food is freshest, service is fast, and there's hardly anyone else there.

What about nightlife and drinking?  Well, I haven't really drunk much since my first year or so of traveling.  Of course drinking is a highlight for a lot of travelers, but honestly I'd rather drink at home.  If there's a type of drink or nightlife experience I'd like -- again, I'll go early at night when again there are fewer people and faster service.  I've also found that it's a lot easier to meet and have conversations earlier on, especially local folk.  Obviously I don't go hard partying much, but once in a while I'll stay out late and wake up later, especially when there's music or another event I want to see.

I'm not a ""morning person"" at all at home.  I woke up at 10:30am this morning for example.  But, I find it a lot easier traveling since I'm usually exhausted and a little jet lagged the first day anyway, and it's easier to reset my schedule to go to bed &amp; wake up early.  I've never been able to convince travel partners to do this with me, and I'm more likely to stay out late with other travel partners, but going solo it's easy.

Anyone else have experience with successes waking up early while traveling?",solotravel,rakuu
Phone plans while traveling abroad?,"Hi everyone,

I had a quick question about picking a phone plan when I take my trip. I expect to be gone about a year and a half, so obviously I'll need a phone with data.

My two options are below:

1. Google fi - I have enough people interested that I can get the family plan and pay $45/month for unlimited data, talk, and text (data is all I care about though)

Pros:
* I get to keep my same number without having to port it over to Google voice
* Nearly worldwide coverage
* No need to get a new sim card every time I switch to another country
* Unlimited data

Cons:
* It's not very popular yet and I can't seem to find reviews from travelers
* Price, while decent, is a bit high compared to developing countries. I'll be traveling mostly in Latin America, so I'm sure I can find cheaper plans.

Option 2. Use my unlocked phone and stick a sim card in with a new plan every time I go to another country. I'd import my number to Google voice so as long as I have data, I'll be able to talk and text with people back home without a hassle.

Pros:
* Potentially cheaper
* More options for service providers

Cons:
* It will be a hassle to switch sim cards every time I enter a new country
* I'm not sure if unlimited data plans really exist in Latin America.

I'm honestly leaning towards option one due to sheer convenience, but want to know if anyone here has experience with the service.

Also, the cost of an unlimited data plan with local carriers would be a factor into my decision. Anyone have any sort of data for an unlimited plan in, say, Mexico? Maybe on Claro o Movistar?

Thank you all so much!",solotravel,Thepopewearsplaid
Suggestions for road trip from Chicago (27M),"Hi all. It looks like I'll be working from home for several more months (my company is saying until January at the earliest). Since I can work from anywhere, I'm thinking that I can travel and work remotely instead of staying at home in Chicago. Any suggestions on where I should go?

I'm thinking of going on a road trip, returning to Chicago after around 2-3 weeks. I'll still work M-F for the usual 8 hours, though I would be open to taking occasional PTO to go sightseeing or drive to my next destination. Most of my sightseeing activities will be in the evenings or weekends. I do enjoy visiting museums, but a lot of them are closed due to COVID, and I find that they're not always open in the evening. Having said that, I do enjoy sightseeing in metro areas and eating out at different restaurants. 

A lot of the northeastern states have imposed quarantine requirements, so I'll probably avoid those. International borders are still closed to tourists, so I definitely won't be driving into Canada or Mexico.

Have any of you done this recently? Any suggestions?",solotravel,za838
Why do so many people on Workaway only accept female volunteers?,"I don't wanna sound some like incel here but it's kinda ridiculous how many hosts state they want female only for jobs that aren't even historically seen as being feminine (One to work at reception in a hostel was what led me to write this post). 

On top of this, there seems to be a large number of male hosts whose review section is exclusively younger women.

Budget for a one month trip to Europe?,"Hello,

I am considering a Eurotrip early next year (hopefully) and can't quite chalk out a budget.

My plan is to basically explore the cities, go on a couple of tours (only the must do ones), and drink and party. I will do hostels and eat mostly street food and some occasional dining out pretty much everywhere except for Hamburg where I will stay with my uncle and his family.

Trip report - 2 weeks (mostly) solo traveling around Costa Rica,"I have just finished 16 days travelling around the beautiful country of Costa Rica. Here is my trip report on what I did, and some tips for anyone planning something similar in the future. 

**Part 1 - Playa Guiones**

The first section of my trip was spent in the Nicoya Peninsula in NW Costa Rica. I stayed in the pretty sweet little town of Playa Guiones. It had some decent restaurants and is great if you like surfing. There aren't any hostels here to speak of, so AirBNB it was. The main reason I was here was to see the [turtles in Ostional](https://mytanfeet.com/costa-rica-national-park/ostional-wildlife-refuge-protecting-turtles/). It was a pretty awesome experience. The Olive Ridley turtles come on the beach (en-mass) to nest a few times every year. To see the number of turtles on this one beach at 5am was a pretty special experience. Interestingly, the turtles are pretty solitary creatures out at sea and only come onto the beach to lay their eggs, before returning to life alone. 

**Note on turtles:**

Best to visit early in the morning to have the best chance of seeing them. The cost to get in was approx. $20 which goes towards the conservation of these turtles. It is one of only 2 places in the world that this event happens so if you're in the area (and it is happening), I really recommend it. 

**Part 2 - Santa Teresa**

Next, I visited the small town of Santa Teresa on the southern coast of the peninsula. Unfortunately, there are no buses from the North-South of the peninsula. The only option from Playa Guiones is PG - Nicoya - Puntarenas - ferry to Paquera - bus to Cobano - bus to Santa Teresa. Should take you about 14 hours to do what could be a 3-hour drive. In ST, I stayed in the super nice [Luz de Luna](http://luzdelunahotel.com/). The place is run by a really cool Belgian guy and has these amazing little huts overlooking a great jungle garden. Seeing monkeys in the evening was pretty sweet! Here I didn't do a huge amount except explore the local area. There are ATVs that you can rent in the main town and there are loads of tide pools along the coast which are pretty cool to swim in. Again, this is a good place if you enjoy surfing! (Or yoga). 

**Part 3 - Puerto Viejo de Talamanca**

I then did a very long trip from Santa Teresa to Puerto Viejo de Limon (on the Caribbean coast). I spent a night in San José just to break up the journey. This was by far my favourite part of the whole couple of weeks. I really liked the Caribbean food (way spicier than what I was getting on the Pacific coast) and there was a lot more going on. I stayed in the pretty awesome [Rocking J's hostel](https://www.rockingjs.com/). Thanks to many recommendations on here for that! The hammocks were super cheap ($5 p/n) and the staff were super chill. The location is great - 30 second walk to the beach! Here, I mainly ate loads of awesome Caribbean chicken and fish + went to the amazing [Gandoca Manzanillo wildlife refuge](https://www.google.com/search?q=manzanillo+reserve&amp;oq=manzanillo+reserve&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.5640j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) where I saw loads of toucans, macaws, sloths + loads more monkeys. To get there, I hired a bicycle from Rocking J's and cycled the 13 or so km. Apart from that, I also did quite a bit of snorkelling in the sea off Rocking J's and met some pretty cool people!

If anyone has any questions, let me know! They're normally my favourite thing to read on Reddit travel subs so hope some of you enjoyed this one. I haven't yet worked out how much it all cost but, probably, quite a lot. Costa Rica is frustratingly expensive.",solotravel,swingingpendulums
Would anybody be interested in virtual travel related hangouts?,"I know I’m one of many who would love to go on a trip right now, but due to obvious reasons (and also school) am not.

Would anybody be interested in virtual hangouts where we can just share travel stories and talk about where we’re from, where we’ve gone, and about the places we wanna go once this is all over? 

Some background about me: I’m a 23 year old woman in St. Louis, Missouri. I’ve only been on one solo trip and it was for 6 weeks to Southeast Asia.

I’m gonna spam for a minute and comment the link on every comment on here so far (which might be annoying, but I don’t wanna miss anyone and it’s faster than messaging them directly) so find the link in the comments or shoot me a message.

Surf and Work in Portugal,"Since we can’t currently return to the office, my company has made a policy that we can work from any country as long as we have a working permit. Being from the EU, I have therefore decided to settle in Portugal. 

I’m currently in Porto, but would like to travel further down south to a place where it’s possible to easily surf after work/in the weekends.

Extravert or Introvert as a solo traveller?,"I have long struggled to decide whether I feel more introvert or extravert and usually tell people I'm an extraverted introvert... Or an introverted extravert.

What is something nice you have done for another (traveler or local) while traveling abroad?,"I saw a post not too long ago about people being helped while on there travels and it got me thinking the other way around and paying it forward. So I'll go first:

When I was in Italy and Vernazza with my bro, we were hiking up to the top to catch the sunset on the town (iconic pic) and on our return we helped an elderly lady. It was getting very dark and she could get her door closed and lock it. We used our lights and tried for like 10min! I was able to understand little and used my spanish (some words overlap I think) and then held her hand and walked her down to town! She thanked us and we went on our way. I would hope someone would assist my grandma if she needed help! 

Sometimes it is the small things that we think are insignificant that add up and matter. Came across a good quote I saw...

How to travel across Asia? (in 2021),"Hello fellow travellers. I have no doubt this question has been posted here before. 

I’m planning on traveling as much of Asia as humanly possible in 2021 (if the corona situation is better) for about 6 months or longer if possible.

I’ve got 15,000 USD with me but I was wondering what the best route would be to take? I plan to do a lot of the traveling on the ground as opposed to flights. I’ll take a flight only if I have to, but I have all the time in the world so I don’t mind long train/bus/bike journeys. 

In terms of what I’m doing, I don’t have much of a plan. I’d like to just explore most of the countries, off the beaten path type of thing. Mainly looking for the best routes from country to country.

Where did your wanderlust come from?,"During Covid I'm taking some time to reflect why I am getting so crazy being cooped up in 1 place. Where did all that wanderlust come from? Is my desire to travel only driven by social media and blogs? I would love to hear where yours come from.

After some reflections I realise a lot of mine just came from my nature and childhood experience. 

Since 7 yrs old ( mid 90s') I often travel with my sport team to other provinces to compete. Air travel was not popular back then, so we mainly travel by train, and in case you didn't already know, train travelling through Vietnam is one of the best rides in the whole world. The scenery always excited me, and I couldn't stop dreaming of jumping out of train alone to experience the landscape, to climb down the cliffs to touch the ocean, to walk among the endless lush forests and hills, to sample all the weird dishes by the vendors at every station in every province.

My dad also had a globe and I often fantasized being in different parts of the world, and back in the 90s information and imageries were scarce, so my imagination of the world was actually very different from reality.

Being in a new strange place always excited me more than scaring me. During middle school I sometimes cycled 20km to the border of my city and that alone gave my the thrills.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can now understand that my decision to travel was largely innerself-driven rather being influenced by marketing. I would also urge my fellow travellers to think about what drives you, so that you may find the experiences that truly make you happy when travelling :)",solotravel,reginafilange89

I got scammed on the box truck purchase and I need to sell it since it has major issues, but I still want to see as much of America’s beauty as possible before I have to go back to university in a few months. I have already lost a few thousand dollars on the box truck investment and am a relatively poor individual but have still saved enough as a student to do a trip like this. 

How can I do this on a budget? I considered sleeping in my car or even buying a cheap trailer to tow behind it to sleep in so that I could avoid hotel costs, and so that I’d be able to camp at national parks more easily. 

Do you guys have any advice? I’m desperate for help here as I am trying to find my way in life, do some self-searching, and discover my true passions before I commit to a career path out of college. I’m aware there are major issues inhibiting travel such as covid, divisive conflict, and natural disasters, but this journey is incredibly important to me and I feel pressed for time to accomplish it since I can’t take more than two semesters off of school without losing my scholarship. 

I’d appreciate anything you can give me (good or bad), thanks.",solotravel,ahill900
Solo cross country road trip almost completed,"Hey y’all! 
I’ve been super depressed for the past couple of years and I finally have found my happiness. I’ve been on a solo cross country road trip for the past three weeks, and I’m currently in Chicago and loving it. I’ve fallen in love with every city and have not had one bad day. Crazy how time alone can bring you the happiness you’ve been seeking. Thanks to many of these traveling subreddit communities, I chose to backpack to Lake Solitude in the Grand Tetons. I’m not sure how to add videos /pictures to this text and if someone could let me know so I can share, I’d appreciate it. Thanks for all the support, solo traveling is by far the best prescription.",solotravel,anonymous3897
Trip report - solo road trip - Minnesota to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks,"Here is my trip report, driving from Minneapolis to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, Sept. 11 through Sept. 18, 2020. I am a solo traveler on this trip, driving my Kia Optima, camping in a tent, and eating food that I’m bringing along. I’m a married father of two girls, and this is my first major solo trip. I visited YNP with my wife and kids last summer, and haven’t been to GTNP since I was about age 3. 

DAY 1 - FRIDAY. Plan: Drive home to Teddy Roosevelt NP

Had to switch to Plan B immediately after leaving the house because Beartooth Pass was still closed when I left home. So reversed my route and driving toward the Bighorn Mountains instead. Drove 830 miles in 13 hours from Minneapolis area to Ten Sleep, WY. Took the loop through Badlands NP in South Dakota and bought my annual pass. Camped at Ten Sleep RV Park, and walked to Ten Sleep Brewing for an evening beer. Saw one cow moose in the Bighorns.

DAY 2 - SATURDAY. Plan: Drive Ten Sleep to Cooke City, MT

Making it all the way to Ten Sleep on day 1 allowed me to take my time getting to Cooke City, where I had a reservation at the Alpine Hotel (no camping due to bears). Departed Ten Sleep at 7am. Drove east back through Ten Sleep Canyon to see it going the other way. Then north to Sheridan, WY for a grocery stop. Next was back through the Bighorns on 14 to 14A, another amazing drive! Checked into the Alpine Hotel, and then headed into YNP for wolf viewing in the evening. Headed to Slough Creek and waited for wolves for two hours, but none were around. Headed back toward Cooke City, and found the Butte Junction wolves (and group of people) there. There were also two grizzly bear right with the wolves, with one wolf following each grizzly. The wolf and grizzly would interact occasionally, it was really neat!

DAY 3 - SUNDAY. Plan: Hike, Mammoth, Hike, end at Madison Campground

Left Cooke City at 615am. Watched the Junction Butte wolfpack again in Lamar Valley. Hiked to Hellroaring Creek, 4.32 miles RT (excellent hike with meadows, woods, ascents and descents). Hiked Mammoth Hot Springs including walking the driving loop, 3.76 miles total. Hiked the Norris Geyser Basin, 2.49 miles total. Drove Firehole Lake Drive, saw White Dome Geyser erupt. Drove out to West Yellowstone to get gas and to call my wife. On the way, watched a bull elk and his ~20 cows along the Madison River. Checked into my campsite at Madison Campground for 2 nights there. I was starting to get a bit tired, but it was too early to stay at camp, so I went for a short drive. I’m so glad I did! At Madison Junction in the Gibbon River, there was a crowd watching something, and I caught a glimpse of a moose heading into the woods. I stopped, and for the next two hours I followed the bull moose and two cows (from a safe distance of course). They stayed in the woods for a while, but I knew they would head back to the river, and eventually they did. They put on a great show! Be sure to watch the video in my album, it was a trip highlight!

DAY 4 - MONDAY. Plan: Hike, tour, geyser watch in YNP

Left Madison at 7am. Drove to Old Faithful area, and watched OF at 745am with just a handful of people. From there, hiked to Mallard Lake, 7.75 miles RT (nice hike with no other people). Walked the Upper Geyser Basin – saw Grand Geyser, Daisy, Lion (twice), OF from Beehive. Then I took a break in the car because Riverside was predicted in about 2.5 hours. As I sat in my car, I watched herds of people and cars, and got frustrated – all of that commotion wasn’t what I wanted. Did some research and found a backup – hiked up Purple Mountain, 6.49 miles RT (challenging climb, great view, few people). Drove Firehole Canyon Drive, and took a dip in the river. Drove to Grand Prismatic in the evening, but there were so many people still there so I didn’t stop.

DAY 5 - TUESDAY. Plan: Drive to GTNP, get campsite, hike to Delta Lake

Left Madison at 640am, and drove toward GTNP via Canyon and Hayden Valley. Saw 5 elk including two bulls, all of them were solo. In GTNP, stopped at Mormon Row and the TA Moulton barn. Drove to Gros Ventre to get a campsite. I waited in line for about 30 minutes, and finally got a site for 3 nights at about 10am. Headed out for the hike of the day – Lupine Meadows TH to Delta Lake. 8.5 miles RT, 2457 feet elevation gain. Fun, challenging hike, with an amazing view at the end, but Delta Lake is no “secret” hike. Then relaxed at the campsite in the evening.

DAY 6 - WEDNESDAY. Plan: Hike Cascade Canyon to Lake Solitude

Depart Gros Ventre at 605am headed to String Lake TH. Hiked String Lake, through Cascade Canyon, to Lake Solitude, and back. 16.79 miles total with 2670 feet of elevation gain. This was an AMAZING hike! I loved it so much – the views in the North Fork toward Lake Solitude are wonderful. Spent about an hour at Lake Solitude enjoying the scenery, ate lunch, saw a fox trot along the lake, and I swam to the small wooded island! The water was so cold but so energizing. In the evening, relaxed at the campsite, and walked around Gros Ventre campground – 2.71 miles total.

DAY 7 - THURSDAY. Plan: Hike Paintbrush Canyon to Holly Lake

Depart Gros Ventre at 6am toward String Lake TH. Hiked Paintbrush Canyon, and continued up toward Paintbrush Divide because I wanted to get over 10,000 ft. elevation. Paintbrush Canyon was really neat, and a different type of hike than Cascade Canyon. I saw one black bear, and a bull elk with two cows. Once over 10,000, I figured I should just go up to the Divide. After I got over the small glacier and saw the final ascent and evaluated my water situation, I decided not to go up to the Divide. Headed back down to destination #2, Holly Lake. Jumped into Holly Lake and talked to 4 other hikers there for a while, then returned to String Lake. 16.42 miles total, 3562 foot elevation gain. Afterward, I got my only restaurant food of the trip – a takeout pizza from Dornans, and it was really good. In the evening, relaxed at the campsite, took a dip/rinse in the Gros Ventre river, and walked along the Gros Ventre river and saw one cow moose.

DAY 8 - FRIDAY. Plan: Drive toward home including Beartooth Pass

Depart Gros Ventre at 6am. Drove north through YNP, exited NE entrance. Saw a few elk, many bison (duh!), a coyote in Lamar Valley. Drove over Beartooth Pass (saw three mountain goats), had a beer at Red Lodge Alex, and made it to Medora, ND Red Trail Campground at 7pm.
DAY 9 - SATURDAY. Plan: Drive TRNP and to home
Depart Red Trail Campground at 615am. Drove through Teddy Roosevelt NP for a while (saw wild turkey, prairie dogs, a lot of mule deer including four bucks). Then headed home, arriving here at 5pm.

SUMMARY:

On the trip, I really wanted to focus on good and challenging hikes away from the crowds, and I found that! The parks were very busy and popular parking spots were over-crowded. Getting just a mile or so away from the roads pays dividends! I also wanted to see wildlife, and wildlife cooperated.

The weather was amazing. Fire haze would settle in every day – mornings started out clear and it generally got hazier at the day went on. High temps were 75-80, lows at night 30-35, very little wind.

While driving, I listened to a lot of podcasts, which seemed to make the driving go much faster than music. 

Thank you for reading! I’d love to answer any questions. I could provide a lot more commentary, but don’t want to bore everyone. In the end, amazing trip, and I really want to do more mountain hiking and would like to do a backcountry trip.",solotravel,PiBrickShop
Have you ever been ignored in places for travelling solo?,"I have been travelling solo for some and for the first time I was ignored. 

Because of covid, I decided to travel in my own country and booked an hotel in the beach, all inclusive. I really needed to be alone and to get some rest and in september there is not lots of people on vacation.

Today at dinner, I have waited for 25 minutes to get some food and was ignored by the staff. Even asking for water. The groups around me were always being served foods and drinks. after 45 minutes finally the guy that gave me my table talked to me. When I entered he said ""poor you, you are alone"" and he remained with the same kind of speech. He even said that because I was complaining I was making him feel bad...I had answered ""imagine how i felt being ignored for all the staff all this time"", got up, left and went to purchase dinner next door.

Has this ever happened to you? How have you dealth with it?I just felt so shamed for being solo and didn't know how to respond.

Thank you.",solotravel,vaniafdasantos
Little ramble/ story,"I first started traveling 2 years ago.  My first actual solo travel trip was Thailand. I stayed there for 3 weeks and loved it.  The food, the beaches, the chaos, and the freedom.  But I didn’t meet a single other traveler until my last day, I made no effort to.  I didn’t realize meeting people was one of the best parts about traveling.  Now since then I’ve been on 5 other trips and my first goal when arriving is to get some good food, and meet some people at the hostel.  

Before traveling I was sort of shy, awkward and self conscious.  

Now I’m way more outgoing, and I enjoy being around new people and learning their story. 

People say they want to travel to “find themselves” and I’m not saying I did “that” but once I made the effort to get out of my comfort zone it seriously had a impact on my life.  

I’m super motivated now, organized and overall more successful in everyday life because of traveling.",solotravel,USA631
Do you have any story of traveling for a longer period of time without a plan?,"So I've traveled a bit over the last years, mostly Europe and the US. As many other people here, I crave for that ultimate adventure, but I like to take things slowly. I have considered doing a 20-30 days adventure without any plan, just a handful of places that I want to reach. 

I was interested in hearing any stories about ""winging it"" trips. What were the main disadvantages compared to a better-planned trip, did you enjoy the freedom, or did it cause you to worry about what you'll do next?",solotravel,MentalAir

American SouthWest in January -- Recs + Budget tips,"Hi Everyone,

Starting to plan for some travel in January-- thinking it would be fun to road trip for Vegas and hit some national parks (Grand Canyon, Zion, Bryce...). Nothing specific set right now as I am just exploring options. I would love to hear from someone who has done this sort of trip in Winter. I'm thinking it would be easiest to rent a campervan (I've found a reasonably priced rental for $50 a day) so that way I don't have to worry too much about camping in cold weather. Are there ample spots to park camper vans? Or would I have to be pay for a campsite every night? Or, do you have any different recs on doing this on a budget (in winter)? 

Would love to hear about overall highlights + lowlights of people who have done this sort of trip! Also, any resources for trip planning would be appreciated (books/ blogs). I'm an avid hiker and excited to explore!

"TRIP REPORT: Playa del Carmen, Mexico (September)","I am sharing some current information about the Quintana Roo region since I am here now. Also willing to answer any questions if I missed something you are curious about.

**Background**: 

Lease ran out, packed stuff into storage and decided to work remotely from here indefinitely, starting September 7th.

**Atmosphere:** 

Most locals wear masks, usually it is the foreigners that don't. Having said that, there does not seem to be that much concern for COVID, at least at this point, compared to what I experienced in cities in the US.

People have their temperature checked and are given hand sanitizer before entering stores or eating at restaurants, etc.

As of Mexican Independence Day, clubs were open until 2AM  or later and bars have bands/music playing.

Traffic is down and there is a major shortage of parties in places like Tulum, etc. Tulum in general felt very empty.

**Sights/Activities:**

All of the cenotes are open as far as I know, with the same precautions as stores (temperature and sanitizer). Tulum and Coba ruins opened last week and I think Chichen Itza opens today. There is a maximum capacity or visitor limit I believe.

Scuba diving is happening and the beaches are open.

**People:**

The travelers I meet are mostly from North/South America and Europe, though I have met Asian ones as well. Tons of people doing the COVID nomad thing.

**Flights:**

I flew on American with a layover in Miami. Social distancing wasn't observed but otherwise the flights left and landed on time with no issues. The flight to Miami was full and the flight to Cancun maybe 65% full.

**Accommodation:**

Marked down a lot. So far I've stayed in Airbnb apartments, hotels and hostel dorms.

Hotel - Wouldn't know COVID existed except for front desk employees wearing masks and using hand sanitizer.

Airbnb - Hand sanitizer, masks.

Hostel dorms - Full or 50% capacity depending on the rules of the place. Only real issues have been a mildew smell if anything.

**Fitness:**

Gyms have reopened and the one I am going to only requires a temperature check and a mask to enter but optional basically when working out so nobody wears one.

**Dating:**

The first week was a bit much. Polar opposite of the action I got from March to May.

**Summary:**

If you are not very concerned about contracting COVID, this is the place to be. My mental health has improved 50X and I couldn't be happier to be out of the US for now, especially with Winter and Elections approaching.",solotravel,RICH_PINNA
Best Central/South American Country For Solo Female?,"I am (tentatively) attending a wedding in Trinidad in early August 2021. I'd love to take the opportunity after the wedding to explore a central or south American country for 3 weeks afterward. This will be my first time as a solo traveller in this area. In this general region I have been to Mexico, Cuba, Dominican Republic, St Lucia and El Salvador, so these are off the table because I want to explore somewhere new. I've been considering Panama, Colombia and Peru, but am open to opinions and suggestions! I know it's pretty early but I need some travels to plan and look forward to haha",solotravel,kanyenawt
Never Booking With Booking.com Book Directly,"I had booked about two months in advance for a trip I had planned to Monterrey/Big Sur for mid September. As the date approached for the trip wildfires started to break out around the area around mid August. These fires were bad and were making air quality horrible and were getting close to the hotel we were staying at. It was counterintuitive to stay somewhere so close to the fires only to just stay indoors the whole time, or worst get stuck out there 2-3 hours away from home.  


Although our stay was still a few weeks away, I made the decision to try to cancel the booking because there was no sign the fires would let up, they did not let up even on the date of our booking. I couldn't have known that and the hotel/booking.com couldn't have known that either, but judging on how bad the fires were and still are, they refused to refund my money.  


The property we were staying at told us specifically that we had to deal with booking.com in order to get our refund. Upon contacting them they then told us that we had to deal with the property directly in order to get our refund. This back and forth lasted for a good hour. That's not an exaggeration. An hour of back and forth trying to reason with booking.com. The property made it clear that on their end, they had not received any payment and that since I booked with a third party (booking.com), they were the ones responsible in issuing me a refund. Even if the property wanted to they couldn't refund me money they hadn't received.  


Making this very clear to the handful of representatives at booking.com that ""assisted"" me, they insisted that the property was the one responsible in issuing me my refund. You can see how infuriating it is when all they did was throw their hands up and tried to shoe me away when clearly stating to them there was no money to return on the property's behalf. They stated that because the property did not clear the transaction they had nothing to give back to me. So my question is now, current day, where did my money go? Of course to booking.com.  


I am now out the money I paid for a reservation we never attended and despite filing a claim they still won the case and kept my money. Stay far away from booking.com. I'm not sure how it is getting refunded with other third party booking agencies, but definitely do not book with booking.com. Whatever money you think you're saving it's not worth it. Just book directly with the property and save yourself the frustration and financial stress of giving your money to a company whose interest is not with the customer but with their own pockets.",solotravel,CenturyOldMilk
Tourist and backpacker density by country,"Having traveled solo in a number of countries; I’d say the density of tourism in a place really has an effect on your experience. It’s not that more tourists is necessarily a bad thing, while I felt a place like Rome was rather overcrowded, I loved the social atmosphere and ease of meeting fellow solo travelers in a tourist-dense country like Thailand. Conversely, being in a place with few tourists can often feel more exotic and unspoilt, but can also lead to feeling bored or lonely. Which countries, in your experience, had a very high density of tourists? What where some of your favorite (or least favorite) destinations where you felt like one of the only tourists there?",solotravel,menimaailmanympari

I'm talking about people who are outgoing and engaging with strangers regardless of their background.

Should I go solo after breakup?,"UPDATE: thank you so much everyone for taking the time to respond. I ended up cancelling and the cancellation fee actually ended up being $400. Not too shabby. Someone mentioned that if I went alone, I would be paying an extra $1,250 for the trip (covers the ex’s cost) and that sealed it for me. When the time is right, I’ll save that money to go solo to a place where I’ve always wanted to go alone — Japan! 

EDIT: sorry, probably posted in wrong sub. 

My relationship just ended before our trip to an all-inclusive resort in Riviera Maya, Mexico, at the end of next month. Debating whether I should still go. I would lose $500 for canceling but would get ~$2,000 back. $500 is a lot to lose. 

I don’t want to ask my ex to help cover the loss if I decide to cancel because I booked the trip and paid for it all as his birthday gift. I also make more than him so I wouldn’t want him to pay and on top of that, he was against going in the first place. Although, as time went on, he was really excited about going. 

In the grand scheme of things, is a $500 loss a lot versus going alone especially during these stupid COVID times? I’ve never before traveled alone this far from the United States and I can’t find anyone else to go with me either. So thinking about going alone but not sure if I’ll be depressed while there.",solotravel,ouidansleciel

NYC solo travel. Good idea??,"I have a break from Sept. 25-30. I don’t really know what to do! I mean I’ve been hiking with my friends, but I miss traveling. I canceled two trips to Europe this year. My first vacation was supposed to be my first solo trip in Finland &amp;amp; Estonia and the second vacation was suppose to be in France with friends. 
Also, I was planning to take my dad to NYC for his birthday, but since he is immunocompromised, we decided it’s not a great idea to take him to NYC (will take him there once we get the vaccine) 
Anyway, I’m 26 years old (male) and a nurse, so COVID doesn’t really scare as much and will wear the proper precaution to protect myself &amp;amp; others. Since I live alone, I can quarantine once I get back. I just want to go somewhere. I’m from NM and the infection rate is about the same as NY. So I feel more comfortable vs going to states like TX or FL.

Camping, takeout, washing hands, social distancing, wearing a mask. But seeking out groups and activities?

Planning trip to Central Europe once covid is done,"Hey there, I'm a 20 year old from Canada. Obviously right now is not the best time to travel, but once covid is done in a year or two and it is safe to travel, I'd love to visit the world. I think that for my first trip I'll go to central europe. 

From my research these seem to be the best cities in central europe. What do y'all think?

\- Berlin

\- Budapest. 

\- Prague. 

\- Vienna. 

\- Krakow. 

\- Amsterdam. 

Is this correct? 

What cities would you guys add to a trip like this, and how many days would you recommend spending in each city? 

The big factors for me are the following: Great nightlife, great places to visit during the day too, making friends (hostels are great for this I hear). 

Is the language barrier big in those cities? I'm fluent in english and in french, thats it. 

Finally, financials are important for me too. I don't want to go to cities that are too expensive. I'm just a student so maybe I'll have about 5 thousand canadian dollars for this trip. If I spend 5 days in 6 cities, that's 30 days. What do you guys think?",solotravel,MorphyvsCarlsen

Car Camping,"Hi there!
This is my first post anywhere on this app, so please ignore any missed nuances.

I’m looking to do a solo roadtrip next summer. This trip will probably span the majority of the United States, and I plan to sleep in my car most of the time, maybe a campsite in a National park here and there.

Currently I have a 2008 Toyota 4Runner, but it’s dying and probably won’t last a roadtrip of the length I want to go.

Is there anyone on here that’s gone car camping and has a car that’s good for that? My research is leading me towards the Nissan Pathfinder or an old Jeep Cherokee. But research only does so much, I would like to have some real experience input.
Thank you so much.",solotravel,Taxation-is-thievery
Advice for long term travel this winter,"Hello! I’m a 22 year old American man planning to travel around Europe from November-March. My parents are currently living in England and I’ll be going to see them in November. My seasonal job allows me several months off, so I would like to stay in Europe the entire time. i have the time and money to make this work and enough saved for emergencies and returning home. Obviously there are quarantine mandates when entering new countries and the possibility of certain areas closing entirely if rates increase. For this reason I’ll probably stay in each country I visit for 3 weeks-1 month, possibly more. 

Does anyone have recommendations for how to travel safely and ethically during this time? i’d like to spend lots of time in rural areas, camping, and volunteering on farms rather than being in crowded cities and putting others and myself at risk. 

I also plan on living as frugally as possible during this time. not because I have to, but because I want to. For example, camping/hostels/work exchange for a room. dumpster diving for food. hitchhiking rather than taking planes and trains. Has anyone done these things around Europe in the COVID era? What did you learn? 

If anyone has other recommendations for how to bum it around Europe during a pandemic, I’m all ears. peace n love, y’all",solotravel,jyow13
Good winter sports hostels in Europe? (Mostly skiing related),"Hi guys!

At the end of this year, I want to go solo skiing somewhere in the alps. Usually, I went with other people and we just rented or stayed in a small house somewhere. However, this time no one wants to join me so I am planning on going alone. Because I do like some social interaction I am looking for good hostels that allow me to do that.

I tried to Google but I don't think there are many hostels aimed towards this, which isn't a problem because I am free to go wherever I want and can. I know hostels are a bit of a problem in these times but I am willing to try it assuming I get some socializing out of it, but hostels that do take the corona rules into account are a big plus.

What I am looking for is pretty simple, close to skiing areas (or close to free transport) and a place to store my skiing gear. It would be awesome if there are other (somewhat) extreme things to do like ice climbing or snow kiting.

If you have tips, or just fun stories, please share! 🤗",solotravel,Taronyuuu
Backpacking Europe in May,Would a backpacking trip in May be worth it with Covid? I’m just worried that we wont be past covid by then so I don’t know if it’ll be worth buying a plane ticket and eurail and then have it potential be derailed due to Covid. Thoughts?,solotravel,thatyummyyum
"When people say they saved X amount of money for their long term travels is that all the money they have saved or they have additional savings accounts (retirement, investments etc)?",Just wondering if I’m being overly worrisome about the financial aspect since I plan to do a long term trip once COVID is done.

Solo ski trip query,"Apologies if this isn't the right place to post this..

I'm 29M and I'm looking for a solo ski holiday in Europe this winter (no family or friends are free or can get the time off). Either over Christmas or any time until Easter - COVID19 permitting

My budget all in is probably €800. Has anyone done one before? What was it like?

Good cities to WFH for a month? (USA),"Basically, I am looking to get out of town for up to a month. I'm stir crazy from quarantine and am going to be working from home for at least another several months, just looking for a different setting so I don't go too crazy. I'm currently in Chicago and am willing to drive up to 14 hours to get to wherever I'm going (don't feel comfortable flying just yet). Thinking of going for the month of October but it's still flexible. Some things that I'm looking for are:


* Decent weather (nothing below freezing) 

* Moderately affordable (although frankly I'm willing to drop a couple grand, just not looking for NYC/Chicago/LA prices)

* Something to enjoy outdoors (beaches, parks, good architecture)

* Enough restaurants that I can get a variety of takeout

I've been thinking of finding some place on the Gulf Coast and just spending all of my time aside from work hanging out on the beach, but I haven't spent any time there before and I want to get some other opinions before I pull the trigger on something. 

Important to note that no matter where I end up, I will be practicing social distancing. I'll be visiting on my own and don't plan to do any indoor activities other than grocery shopping and I will respect all local mandates. I'll also do a full two week quarantine when I return.

How to solo travel while in a relationship?,"Sharing my travel plans (after COVID obviously) with my partner &amp; realizing that we have very different travel goals for the future. 

He doesn’t like traveling for extended periods of time / has a dog so doesn’t want to leave for long, while I want to do multiple multi-month trips on a budget, and even live abroad for an extended period of time teaching English. 

It makes me sad because I don’t like doing long distance relationships, but don’t want to break up with someone for that reason right now during the pandemic when traveling isn’t even a possibility. I was also excited thinking of traveling together, but all those hopes were dashed when he flat out said no to my mapped out trips.

"Solo traveling for almost two years. More or less stuck in S.E.A. due to Covid. Looking for feedback, advice, thoughts, etc. Slight vent.","Throwaway.

Just at a point where I'm trying to sort through my options moving forward. Obviously options are limited but would greatly appreciate feedback/advice from this community incase others may know something I haven't thought of. I'll try to give a quick rundown.

Almost two years ago I quit my job in the States and started to travel. Arrived in Vietnam late February and then boom. For three months there were no international flights. Some are operating now but are a bit unreliable due to loads of cancellations. Boarders are still closed, indefinitely. Obviously I cannot travel the way I did before. There is nothing back in the States for me (no job, home, etc.) and frankly I'd rather not return anytime soon due to the...lackluster...response to Covid. EU is out of the question because U.S. citizens are not being granted access to travel/visit. Even so, they aren't accepting flights from Vietnam which is strange considering how well this country has done during the pandemic, containment wise. I'm aware Britain and Ireland are still taking us Yanks but that could change at any moment.

As mentioned, Vietnam has done almost remarkably well during these times with managing the virus. Even with the recent second wave. After one month it seems almost totally stabilized. I quite like it here but damn the climate has been a really getting to me (was only planning on three weeks!).  I've talked with other ex pats here but I'm not very well integrated with the community. To be honest, not that interested in it. Simmering in your own thoughts these times can be a bit taxing and sometimes feels pointless.

Just renewed my visa for another three months. I would love to hear what you folks would do if in my position because I'm sort of hitting a wall trying to come up with something. Should I just hang until this ""blows over""? Try my options elsewhere if possible and relatively safe? Pretty much have zero obligations and prospects in life at the moment.

Thank you all who read this.

Any alternative way to use internet as a solo traveler?,"I know the title might upset some people. But please read on first.

When solo traveling, I sometimes find myself needing internet connection for some particular task or issue that needs to be solved.

When traveling solo and staying at a hostel is it easier to make friends being a girl or guy or does it not matter?,"I’ve been lurking at this sub and have recently thought about the idea of solo traveling. One of the things that’s holding me back however is the thought of going somewhere and not making friends as I am pretty introverted.

This however just got me thinking about whether it’s easier to be a girl or guy when solo traveling being at a hostel in terms of making friends and joining other groups.

[Report] 7 days in Northern Italy.,"A while ago I made a post with a title like ""7-10 days trip in Northern Italy"". Here's my report. Be prepared, it's long. I'll start with what I saw and did, then will do a small part on my mood and mental health during th e trip. 

First, thank you all for the advices. I'm still in the trip, but have only one day left which will be for chilling and no intense visiting.

Also, it's Italy. It's always a good idea to go to Italy. 

My initial plan was : Milan - Lake como - Bergamo - Lake Garda - Lake iseo. 

MILAN
-----------

I started with 2 days in Milan. I have friends there, so it was an obvious staring point. My Italian friends there don't like the city, but I quite enjoyed it. I have to admit that for once, the covid situation is making things better as there are less tourists, and hotel prices are lower. I stayed at the hotel Flora near the central station. 55€/night. Not good, not bad. OK for solo. I really enjoyed the city. The architecture, the different neighbourhoods, the people,... Really loved it (my feet after 26km,a bit less). I saw the Duomo of course, which was pretty much empty. Really impressing, and the galleries near it as well. I did pretty much all the Da Vinci museums / places, except the church with the last supper, as it was closed for the afternoon (?!). I also did a lot of churches, parks, places, the Milan University (where you can have beers every night right in front the beautiful main building), etc. 
I spent the last evening in the navigli area, with a beautiful sunset over the river and the colorfull bars and restaurants. I then moved to Lake Como. 

LAKE COMO
-------------------


I had booked 2 nights in Bellagio, at the hotel Fioroni. Around 65€/night, family run. Really nice place, had a double room for myself with a tiny balcony, absolutely stunning view on the mountains, could see a bit of the lake on my left. Just imagine, waking up, having the sunrise on the yellow houses and the lush green mountains, with an absolute silence. 
Paradise. Good breakfast too and free parking. 
15 minutes walk from the city center, either by following the road with view on the lake, or from inside the village, which makes you arrive on the other side of bellagio. 
This city/village is really really great and beautiful. More tourists than in Milan though, on a Sunday evening. The Monday was totally empty. Amazing food, stunning view on the lake. 

For food, try the enoteca cava turaciolo. Simple and good set of cheese and ham, but it's the wine that you go there for. I took a tester of 3 wines, 2 reds and one white. One of the red just blew my mind. Sfurzat carlo negrid. Just, wow. Waiter took the time to explain the origins, how to pour it properly, and we descussed a bit. 

All the little narrow streets are super cute, and for the Instagram fans, that's where you can take a lot of the empty narrow streets pictures. 

The next day, I went to visit Como. Quite nice town, about an hour drive from Bellagio. They have an hydroplane club, nice and cute city center. The Duomo is quite impressive as well, but that's for the walk on the pedestrian alongside the big villas that you go there. Simply beautiful. Makes you wish the time stops. I just stayed an one bench for 20 minutes, lookking at the opposite side of the lake, without thinking to anything. Only disturbed by a chopper bringing construction material to what i guess is the future villa of a rich person. 

Then I drove to cernobbio. Equally beautiful and much more peaceful, but smaller. I also could have gone there on foot from como. I did not stayed there too long, but still enjoyed it. And, as everywhere on Lake como, the view is just splendid. 

The last evening I went back to my hotel in bellagio, and I went for supper to the hotel métropole. I wish I had not. I should have checked Google before. I just saw they had the traditional fish risotto from that area. They rushed everything, I got the dish while I still had my aperitivo. Then the wine. I ordered the same whine I had the day before (the surfzat) at the enoteca. They did not serve me what I ordered. I got a low grade headache-inducing shitty wine. The fish on the plate was, I'm pretty sure, reheated in a micro wave oven. That really took my mood down. Shame because I was in a pretty good spirit by then.

At least, I could enjoy one of the most beautiful sunset I've ever seen in my life. 

 Anyway, I got the fuck out of there and we t back to my hotel, prepping for the next day, which was departure day to Bergamo, just for the day and spent the night in garda, on the lake of the same name. 

When I woke up, I did not want to go to Bergamo. I was just too in harmony with the lake como, and I wanted to see the villa del barbianello, which I could not visit before as it was closed on Mondays. So I figured, let's go to varena, and take a boat trip from there. 

The drive was really enjoyable, loads of little cute villages. 

When I arrived in varenna, I was instantly charmed by the place. This is the typical lakeshore village, absolutely stunning, cute, loving, *insert any adjective here*. I absolutely love the place. Made me think I want to spend my retirement there. 

As the streets are a bit narrow, not many tourists still felt like a bit more than in the other places. But it's as idealistic as you could expect. 

Got a pizza at the bar il molo. Fairly priced, and OK for quality. Spirits are cheap too. The ice cream was ginormous and cheap. 

In the end, I did not go to the villa del barbianello, as I'd prefer spending more time in Varenna. 

But still, around 3pm,i had to take the road for the 2hours drive to Garda. 


LAKE GARDA
---------------------

The drive to Garda (the city) was a bit less pleasant then around Lake Como, but that was expected, as it's a good chunk of highway.

Instantly, I felt like I should have started with garde then como, as the landscape is quite a downgrade. Don't get me wrong, it's also really nice and beautifully, but the scenes are less grandiose than on Lake como.

Many many more tourists there, and if the prices are much lower than on lake como, the quality is too. The bars are more rushed. Hotel is meh. 

I'm not feeling confortable here. I want to leave. I'm writing these lines ""enjoying"" a spritz on the harbor.

One think that is really nice, is the sunset. There a small cliff going down slowly to the water surface and the sun drops being it, showing you wonderful colors and a stunning view. Can't complain about that at all.

I've been trying to go to a restaurant two times, but it seems like they don't like solo travellers. That pissed me off more than I'd care to say, because I really wanted to go there. 

Tomorrow will be driving to lake iseo, a hotel in iseo and a short night before going to the airport around 5m to come back to my no-so-sweet Belgium.

MENTAL HEALTH
---------------------------

first of all, I'm not what we can say a very stable person. I have my moods, and they can change quite quickly. That being said, I'm still quite rational or I'm trying to be.

If you've read what i wrote before, you've deduced that everything was going pretty well until that first disgusting restaurant in Bellagio. That started to bring my spirit down. But I spoke to friends through fb and it went OK.

Globally, I chilled while I Was visiting everything, stopped when I wanted to stop, ignored what I wanted to ignored, and just did wathever I wanted without caring for anything or anyone. This is a wonderful feeling.

I did not go into deep thoughts. Just left a blank in my brain. Looking to nature or whatever was in front of me, and to nothing else.

Basic rule, don't look at your emails. Don't look at the news. Cut yourself from everything. I've partially failed at that for the news. But did not checked my mails.

Now, in garda, my mood is really down. I just want to be over with this place. Not enjoying it at all. I went to sirmione today, but Barelystayed 2h,to see and go.

Yesterday evening I just took spritz on spritz, not being drunk, but just to occupy my mind. Which is not good. I told my self I'd not do that today... Well, I've just finished my second one. But I'll go for food now and not take alcohol.

I just don't know what to think, or how to improve my frequent depressed mood. 

One think that cheers me up for after the trip though, is that through a friend we have in comon, we'll go to a concert with a girl a fancy. (My friend will be there too, but that's totally ok).

Now the sun Is slowly going down, revealing a beautiful scene, and that's cool.

CONCLUSIONS
------------------------

some places were lovely, others stunning, others not so much. But overall a quite nice stay.

I guess I have to work a bit more on my mindset and how to improve it to enjoy more the time I spend alone, and go over micro setbacks more easily.

I haven't met anyone, and did not desire too, so that's cool.

I've probably left things aside, so feel free to ask any questions.

Cheers.


Edit : here's the report for the last 1.5 days.

So last day I went to the lake iseo, as it was planned originally and I've often seen online that it's sort of a hidden gem.

It is.

There an island (actually, 3 islands) in the lake, one being much more massive than the others (like it is 9km circonference). It's quite lovely, and the water is really clear. Haven't seen anyone swimming though. I went on the island with the ferry from sulzano. 5.5€ for a return ticket, takes 5 minutes to go to the other side. Runs every 20 min.
 Monte Isola, the big island, is really lovely. Nice colors, quite chill. Again, September + covid made it quite empty of tourists, just a few here and there.

I did not do the whole tour of the island, nor the climb up the castle. I was following my feet, and they brought me halfway up, then wanted to go back down and have a beer, enjoy the view and the very warm weather.

I spent in total something like 2h there, but it's worth spending more. Apparently in June and July they place some floating paths between the islands, so you don't have to take the boat. They were not installed anymore yesterday.

After taking the ferry back to sulzano, I went to the charming little village of Iseo, where I had booked my last hotel. Hotel ambra, 65€/night. Quite nice actually. Had to wake up at 4.30 to gety plane in milano, and they offered early check out and breakfast by the on duty person for the night. Really appreciated.

Iseo itself looks quite touristic, but the inside has some old style Italian feelings, which I always like.

Just spent the evening looking at the lake, got a nice (big!) ham cuts as starter and a pizza as main, to properly end up my Italian stay (had the pasta yesterday at the bussola restaurant in Garda).

Now, enjoying an iced coffee at the only Starbucks in Italy at milano malpenza Airport, waiting for my flight.

There you go, report complete.

Question about airport security at JFK,"Hello everyone,

I have my first international trip coming up and I had a couple of questions hopefully someone can answer.
I have two tickets booked with two separate airlines since there is no option for a connection ticket with the trip I need. One ticket is with Delta, so I would fly from my home airport to Atlanta with a small layover in Atlanta and then into JFK. Later that same day about seven hours later, I have a flight scheduled with Royal Air Maroc. Being that it's a international trip and a completely different airline with no connecting ticket, do I actually need to go outside the airport again and go back through TSA or can I just change terminals and check in at the RAM desk and give them my luggage?

ANNOUNCEMENT: Upcoming AMA with Kyra from the No Country for Moving Podcast on SEPT. 23,"Hello everyone! We are very excited to host solo-traveling badass Kyra for an AMA on Wednesday, **September 23** (an earlier version of this had the wrong month, sorry!). Please see her introduction below:

&gt; Hello r/solotravel! 

&gt; My name is Kyra, and I'm the 34 year old SOLO BLACK FEMALE traveler, who calls Brooklyn her home. Although these days, most of my travel has been stateside, I always aim to take a good walking tour along with a deep dive of the history of every space, city and locale that I frequent. I'm a passionate urbanist who enjoys creating spaces in the arts and culture with a social justice framework and through the elevation of unheard voices of marginalized communities.

&gt; Case in point, I started a podcast called **@nocountryformoving**. On my podcast, I interview immigrants and migrants from across the globe about their story, political and socio-cultural differences between their native country and their host country, and even what it's like to date outside of their culture! 

&gt; What is driving this AMA is that I have been traveling solo since I was 20. First to my parent's motherland of Ghana, and then to countries such as Morocco, Argentina, Spain, Colombia, Ecuador, India, and the list continues! Each time I have traveled solo, I received similar responses from friends and family, "" Are you traveling with friends? Why not choose another country to go to? Are you sure that is a good idea? And each time my response was adamant, ""I'm going and I will be safe."" Of course, sometimes I wasn't that safe or made the best decisions, but I learned from them, and one thing that I was very sure about was that I needed to share my story and experiences with whomever I could so I could become a resource to the community as well. As a single Black woman, there have been a lot of insurmountable obstacles that I have faced that should be shared and learned from and I'm ready and willing to do that with you!

&gt; My travel timeline for reference:

&gt; * May-July 2008 - Ghana
&gt; * April - August 2010- India
&gt; * September 2010- July 2013 - Madrid, Spain
&gt; * July 2013 - August 2016 - Buenos Aires, Argentina
&gt; * Patagonia, Colombia, Ecuador April - October 2016


&gt; Highlights from the Kyra Tour

&gt; * Running with the bulls twice in Pamplona and only falling asleep once
&gt; * Getting lost in Las Fallas
&gt; * Being denied entry on the Moroccan and Spanish border
&gt; * Chamuyando (charming) my way back into Argentina after a return flight from America
&gt; * Getting trapped on the Ecuadorian and Colombian border
&gt; * Trapped in Buenos, Argentina due to a financial snafu
&gt; * Bloodwork debacles in the era of Zika
&gt; * Almost going to jail India
&gt; * Malaria in Ghana
&gt; * Falling in love in Buenos Aires/Patagonia
&gt; * Psychotic bosses in NYC

When you do watch an episode, please #nocountryformoving and reference the episode as well as @kymab on IG. 

&gt; Do not hesitate to ask me all of the questions, no matter how creepy or off-putting or uncomfortable. Since I'm gainfully fun-unemployed, I'm overeager to answer your questions. So get at me here, IG or Facebook.

&gt; PSA: I'm doing this AMA to dispel the myth that Black women do not travel and to  provide an entrance into a door of a Black female travel experience. **Representation matters!**

&gt; PSA2: I'm open to collaborations in the future around my podcast, so slide into my DMs or PMs.

&gt; Fun Fact: [this photo](https://imgur.com/a/tImKj6J) is my birthday weekend over a 10 ago prior to my bed bugs debacle in Essaouira, Morrocco.




We're going to start collecting questions now, so for anyone who's not sure they'll be able to make the AMA in real-time, please post your questions below and we'll move them over to the AMA on the day of.

"Bilbao, Spain --&gt; Rome, Italy in One Month","I'm planning a month long trip to Spain, France, and Italy for sometime in 2021, maybe? I'll be traveling with a Brompton folding-bike and traveling by bus and train. I have a first draft route made out to cover 30 days.

I did a month in Spain in 2018 and traveled the perimeter of the country clockwise beginning and ending in Bilbao. I also added Mallorca between Barcelona and Valencia. The trip was surprisingly easy  as far as logistics went, so now I'm eager to do it again and spend more time on the Mediterranean.

I'd like to hear about disc-golf courses, bike routes, day-trips to national parks, and roads-less-traveled. I'm 420 friendly and am not afraid to ask people where it's at, so any pointers on finding that  would be appreciated!

I'll edit this post as I plan the trip and add in people's suggestions. I hope to hear from you!

Schengen Zone for Dual Citizens,"I am an Australian looking to backpack across Europe for an extended period of time in a few years when hopefully Covid has settled down and air travel is back to normal. The time I want to stay there will exceed three months, which is the maximum amount of time allowed there without a visa.

Moving abroad for work,"So I'm 25M Canadian, I've done a decent amount of traveling however I've always wanted to have the different experience of actually living in a new country as opposed to traveling in it. Maybe it's the pandemic and the thought that I won't be able to do any extensive traveling anytime soon, but it's really making me want to pull the trigger and just move to a new country and start working/living there for 1-2 years. That way I can still somewhat be ""traveling"" but while also living somewhere new.

My ideal choices are Ireland or New Zealand, and I'd prefer to work within my field (architecture/construction) but I wouldn't be opposed to working any odd job until I could find something else.

Can anyone share their experiences with moving to a new country for work? Did you have the job offer first before you moved? Or did you just take the plunge and move there without a job and then found one once you were there?",solotravel,nuggets95

"After Coronavirus, going solo tripping across China as a black female? Heritage trip.","So, in a couple of years I'm hoping to go hopping across China (after I save more money and this pandemic is over).

Best Cities in Europe to Party? (20 Years Old),"My good friend and I are planning to spend roughly a month in Europe next summer, (this may end up happening in 2 summers due to COVID). But anyway, we're trying to figure out where to go. We are both 20, coming from Los Angeles. We went to London, Paris, and Amsterdam last summer and had a blast, but at most places, the crowds were a bit older than us, (which isn't surprising since we were 19 and 18).

Trying to find the best cities for nightlife and generally, younger nightlife, (our age). Our Current list of possible cities; Barcelona, Berlin, Prague, Budapest, Krakow, and Ibiza. What do you think of the list? Good, bad, or any better places out there? Thanks!

**Update:** Thank you everyone so much for all the recommendations!

We've decided we definitely want to visit Budapest, Prague, and Barcelona. Now we are just trying to narrow down other cities while we do some research!

What To Pack For Hiking In The UK (Summer 2021),"So, as the title of my post states, I'm considering a solo hike somewhere in the UK (I'm from the UK already)(nothing set in stone yet, but I'm considering the South West Coast Path) during summer next year.

I'm really here just asking for advice, especially as an inexperienced hiker (also I'll be 20F). What sot of physical preparation should I put in beforehand? What sorts of things should I pack?

How much money for trips?,"Hello! I’m over here daydreaming (and also planning) about multi-month travel trips. I’ve planned an Eastern Europe trip (Albania, Croatia, Greece, Slovenia, Slovakia, Macedonia, Hungary, Prague, Turkey, Poland, Ukraine) trip that would most likely last about 3-4 months. How much money would you advise having for that trip? I’d be being as frugal as possible, staying in hostels, only renting cars when necessary/taking public transpo, &amp; eating frugally when possible.

Same question for a Southeast Asia trip I have planned. (Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, Philippines, Bali, etc...) Would also be frugal and take public transport/stay in hostels.

I’ve done a few 3-4 month trips on 4-6K$ USD, but I’m unsure of how to gauge the price of these trips, as usually my trips have 1 or 2 main destinations and not upward of 10 or 15. I currently have 10K USD (a number that will hopefully increase as the travel ban continues), so would be looking at doing my first trip as soon as it’s over. 

Also, can anyone just give me general advice for being a solo female traveler in either of these areas!

Thanks in advance",solotravel,nug-princess
What areas did you experience the most intense touts in your solo travels?,"This is just for fun. I know there are a lot, but the ones that immediately come to mind for me are:

In Indonesia, trying to sit on the beach in Legian. Touts trying to get you to by trinkets or give massages and manicures on the beach. Every two minutes someone would come by, not exaggerating. Definitely not a place to relax. Thank you for letting me know my nails look ugly and it’s why I don’t have a boyfriend. I got shamed so much I decided I probably did need to get one as soon as I leave the beach but I just don’t want to get a mani pedi on the sand.

In India, getting off the bus in Jaisalmer. Touts trying to get you to go with them on a camelback desert tour. All up in your face, yelling for your attention, no personal space at all. 

In Vietnam, getting of the bus in Saigon. So many people trying to get me to go with their tuk-tuk. One even said I was dropped on in zone 3 and too far away from zone 1, where all the hotels are. Luckily I saw the address on a store stating this was zone 1. Now that I think about it, this more of a scam not a tout.

Solo Dude Ranch/Guest Ranch trip?,"Just curious if anyone has ever been to a dude/guest ranch solo (more specifically the ones that are all-inclusive)? A few of them don’t even charge a single supplement, and some of them that do are a minimal cost. 

I love the idea of horseback riding all day, the communal meals, other activities such as archery and hiking, and maybe some time in a pool/hot tub or a massage (a little bit of luxury wouldn’t hurt, but it doesn’t have to be a luxury guest ranch by any stretch). 

I have been looking in Montana, Wyoming and Arizona, but I’d love to hear about any location. Obviously right now the wildfires and smoke are affecting the American West. I am curious what time of year you traveled as it seems this would largely affect the experience.

I miss my people. I miss solotravel.,"I need to get this off my chest.

Solotravel is the only time I get to feel truly 'connected'. The people I meet, whether its late night star gazing, watching the penguins come ashore at the beach, drinking to obliteration through the town, doing cartwheels off a dare, riding a sketchy bus together, or just walking around town it awe. Its discovering what 'in the moment' means. I miss solotraveling and making friends so much.  I miss that hostel life.

Theres something special that you 'let go' of when travelling abroad. You stop looking at people for their 'profession' and instead as a person. You dont have anywhere to go but here, so you take it all in. No distractions, no meetings, no texts, just living..being awake. 

I dont get that much here in the US. Im 31 now, and I have a decent job that pays me a silly amount of money. Ive once returned from my travels before and was unemployed, it was not fun and was a reality check on how difficult it is to land a decent job. No money = no travel. Right now, my plan is the grind it out a few years, invest money, and change careers to something where I can take more time off where I can not worry if I dont make much (or anything at all). I try not to have too much material attachments just in case i decide to say 'fuck it'. 

 This is just me ranting, wondering how my other fellow travelers are. Sending out love and reminding myself that I am not alone. I will see you guys out there again. Well party it up, ride scooters in flip flops, and have conversations about the most random to deepest bs ever. 

Its tough right now, on everyone. I love and miss my friends both made and soon to make. Please folks, be safe and keep your head up. Ill see you guys soon.",solotravel,LegSnapper206

"Eureka Springs, AR, or Branson, MO?","Hi.  Basically haven't left my house for six months.  Been taking quarantine very seriously.  Looks like I'll have to do some travel on family business.  No way am I flying.  So it's a road trip.   Branson and Eureka Springs are at about my halfway point for this drive.  Gonna grab a motel out that way.  As long as I'm out there, I'll poke around and see what I can see.  Masked up and distant of course, and nowhere near restaurants or bars.   Just wandering the towns for a bit in the late afternoon / evening and then maybe a bit the next morning.

Looked on the web a bit for things going on there and have an idea what's available, but would like an insider / indie / solo traveler view.  I like quality museums, good restaurants, and brewpubs, but those are off the list unless they have food/drink to go.  Maybe looking for interesting scenery / outdoor spaces, funny roadside insanity, maybe some walking trails, history sites, and as little consumerist/corporate culture as possible (leaning away from Branson for that reason).  Given those criteria... someone talk me into or out of one town or the other. 

This might be only glimpse of the world for *another* six months (and given these two options, that's kinda pathetic!), so I want to choose wisely.",solotravel,fevertronic
Happiness only real when shared?,"Hello fellow travelers,

The question is in the title, for those of you who don't know it, it's a quote from the movie ""Into the Wild"".

I've had my share of experiences traveling and I miss it immensely, this is not only due to the worldwide circumstances with the Covid pandemic and the measures governments are taking to prevent the spread. My last ""real"" solo journey was two and a half years ago when I went to The Gambia for three months (as part of an internship)

I got to meet and work with wonderful people that I miss dearly, a colorful culture, beautiful nature and even wild parties at the Senegambia beach clubs. Experiences for which I will remain eternally grateful.

After returning to my country, I haven't really felt home anymore, my heart lies with Mama Africa. The reason for my title though is that I can't share this feeling with anyone back here. No one was there and while they are fully supportive of my dreams to go back, the feeling that happiness is only real when shared is starting to loom on me.

Sure I make friends as I go along and we make memories, but when traveling solo, you don't stay in touch with everyone. Experiences are fleeting and while that makes it beautiful, it also hints at the tragedy of the ever devouring nature of time and getting older.

So my question is really for those that made the move leaving their home country, family and friends for a lifetime of travel. How do you look back at it and how do you feel about what the title suggests?

I also wouldn't mind hearing stories of solo travelers who ""found their pack"" or ""found new roots"" to cheer my too-young-to-be-nostalgic ass up

Thanks!",solotravel,goldenradiovoice420

How to Reignite the Spark of Doing Trips/Activities Solo,"Hey all; I'm in need of some advice from this wonderful community on something that's not *strictly* about solo travel (although definitely is a part of it!) but also about doing more general activities alone, so I hope it's okay to post this!

I've always been happy to do things solo; be it a city break, going to a gig or just taking in a museum and all that good stuff, mainly for the usual reasons; being single, unreliable friends, just feeling spontaneous etc.  However, I've recently noticed I've been more reluctant to do these activities myself. For example, I'm off work next week and I know this time last year I'd have considered and done all sorts of things to fill my time; a city break in Europe, have a trip round the zoo, see some of the sights I haven't seen in London yet. I'm finding it really hard to get motivated to do these similar sort of things this year though. Obviously COVID comes into play, but I was mulling over a little day trip to the coast as it's meant to be a scorcher next week, but I'm just struggling to find the will to do it on my own. 

I feel like I'm experiencing a bit of solo burnout or rut. I do so much on my own and have many great experiences that I would  never have had if I didn't take the plunge to do things myself, but part of me is thinking when planning of things to do in my head ""I wish I could share this experience with others"". It's wearing me down a bit and making me feel quite hard on myself because as it stands, next week I'll just be sitting on the sofa all week. It's even little things like going to the local coffee shop on my own I'm feeling resistance towards.

Has anyone else ever felt like this? Is there tips anyone can give of how to get out of this mental roadblock I've set myself for some reason? It just seems very weird; obviously with the exception of COVID my personal circumstances hasn't really changed in the past year that would make me flip from preferring to do things solo to the opposite.

Anyone have any cool Covid travel stories?,"Id like to hear some cool solo travel stories that anyone has had during Covid. Heres mine.

Back in early December I left the U.S. for a 3 month journey to Georgia ( the country) . My plan was to head to Istanbul for 10 days on my way back to the U.S. By the time i left Georgia on March 3rd, Covid was already buzzing about on the news. 

After a few days in Istanbul, countries started announcing the closure of borders and airports. I had to make a decision on whether i would leave early and head back before Turkey shut down or just ride it out. I have a small lawn care business in Montana I run by myself so had to figure out if it was worth going back. I decided to put my business on hold and stay. 

I booked a room for 2 months in a massive 4 bedroom apartment next to Galata Tower. Luckily for me the owners were stuck in another part of Turkey and by this point all international and domestic flights were grounded. I had  the entire apartment to myself for 2 months. I met some other people living in the apartment complex who were throwing lovely hard techno raves on the rooftop complete with lights, smoke machines and other party treats every weekend. 

At the end of April i met an amazing Turkish girl and we ended up falling in love. It was my first time in Istanbul so we explored the city and I was able to see Istanbul in a way that people had never seen before. Normally bustling streets were empty, tourist destinations desolate of humans but filled with the famous streets cats. 

In July, 1 month past my visa expire date, flights started resuming. The only country accepting people flying from Turkey was Serbia so i decided to head there for a week to reapply for my tourist visa. Despite the U.S. embassy saying i wouldnt be penalized for overstaying my visa, i still had troubles getting back in. After 3 hours of talking with multiple police and walking all over the new and massive Istanbul Airport i was finally able to enter. The catch, I had 10 days to apply for temp residency. 

Now, 6 months from when i first arrived in Turkey, im still here. My girlfriend and i have just moved into our first apartment. I wont be heading back to the U.S. until March or April of next year. I know Covid has caused all sorts of mess in the world but for me its been a real treat.",solotravel,robwander3031

I applied in March 2019 and I had to have entered by March 12th 2020. I’m not sure whether NZ boarders were still open to people then? 

Any advice would be great.",solotravel,Wheres_the_FI_RE
I need to escape winter in Britain for health reasons,"I have various health problems which are hugely exacerbated by the cold damp winters we get in Britain, and are helped by being somewhere really hot. 

I've seen some huge improvements in my health in recent years because I've spent a month in South India the last two winters (including being quarantined in Goa but that's another story)

So I need to somehow escape the winter too somewhere close to the equator that's not too expensive. It would be nice if it's by the sea and not too risky in terms of horrific diseases, but other than that I'm very open to ideas where, if anywhere, I'm likely to be allowed to visit. I realise it may be impossible, or that I may have to quarantine, of course.

Any ideas where I can go?",solotravel,slartymcbartyfast

Need suggestions on what to do in Canada in december.,"Hi guys,

Long time lurker and first time poster. So I just recently moved to Canada from the UK and I'm currently based in Toronto. My workplace forced us to pick dates for our annual leave back in April and I randomly picked 2 weeks off from Dec 7th to 18th hoping the travel restrictions might have eased off by then and I can travel out of Canada to go somewhere warm. Unfortunately doesn't seem like it and now I have 2 weeks off so was hoping if anyone here have any suggestions where I can go within Canada? 

I can't ski/snowboard :( is the west coast still worth doing if I don't participate in those activities?

I was also thinking I might go try dog sledding or go aurora watching then. But I feel even those activities aren't ideal in December when it's not quite peak snow season. 
I might try learning skiing again if there's really no better suggestion. Go for lessons for a couple of days and spend the rest of the days chilling out on the west coast.

I've tried changing my leave dates but management isn't budging (plus I can't bring any leave forward to use in 2021). I'll also be traveling solo if that matters? 

Any suggestions will be appreciated!!",solotravel,choki-choki

Trip Report 2020 (from America): Cozumel Aug 1-30,"Solo travel, 33M, scuba diver, working part time 

**The flight:** 

There are no direct flights from any of the bay area airports to Cozumel. There were some that flew to Cancun, but then to get to Cozumel would require a \~1 hour taxi plus \~1 hour ferry ride. I decided on AA because they fly straight into Cozumel from Dallas. I flew out of SFO. The flights between Dallas and San Francisco were around half full both ways. Excellent. The flights between Dallas and Cozumel were fully booked both ways. Unfortunately, AA does not block middle seats. People were generally good about wearing masks. You’re allowed to take it off to eat or drink but you have to put it back on when you’re done. AA did a good job of personally reminding people to put their masks back on during the flight. 

**The trip:** 

This was my third time in Coz. Compared to the last two times, it felt like a ghost town. More than half the shops downtown weren’t open. Bars/restaurants weren’t blasting music – an improvement, IMO. There was a curfew at around 10 pm every night. 

Diving was spectacular. I did 20 dives in Cozumel and 4 dives in the Cenotes on the mainland, between Playa del Carmen and Tulum. If you get a chance to dive the Cenotes, YOU MUST DO IT. It’s so different from diving in the ocean. The coral in Cozumel looked very healthy, likely because there's much so much less activity from divers and the large cruise ships that dock in Cozumel. 

Also did a weekend trip to Isla Mujeres to swim with the whale sharks! It's whale shark season and they are migrating south. The trip isn't cheap, especially from Cozumel. I had to stay overnight in Playa del Carmen because the trips leave from Playa early morning. It was worth to swim with the whale sharks, but I wouldn't do it again.

Some of my favorite restaurants: 

1. Crazy King Burrito for their shrimp burritos  
2. Jeanies (good wifi, good place to watch the sunset, prices are reasonable for a touristy restaurant on the water) 
3. Coconuts (schill beach bar/restaurant) 
4. MEGA grocery store for their ceviche. 

**The social scene:** 

I was working half time and did not have time to put a lot of effort into meeting new people. My days mostly consisted of early morning dives, get back to the hotel around noon, shower, and hop online by 12:30 (10:30 am in pacific time) and worked until 6pm or so with plenty of breaks in between. 

One of the reasons I love diving is because you can meet people fellow divers from all over the world. At minimum, there is always a German on the boat. Love the Germans. That wasn't the case this time. Everyone was from America, which is fine. I grabbed lunch/drinks a few times with fellow divers. Most of the tourists I saw were age 50 and up. There weren’t a lot of ways to meet people organically.

**Safety Precautions:** 

\-	I had my temperature taken and was given hand sanitizer at the entrance of every grocery store, mall, dive shop, ferry boat entrance, and most restaurants. The larger the operation, the more likely this happened. I did not have my temperature taken at the mom-and-pop type places.  

\-	The locals were good about wearing masks, especially in the touristy areas. It was clear that the locals were doing what they could to make visitors feel safe, considering that the island relies almost ENTIRELY on tourism. I stayed mostly in touristy areas. Probably 90% of the locals I saw wore masks. There was a noticeable decline in safety precautions when I went to the super local areas. Unfortunately, the tourists were less great about wearing masks. I would estimate mask adherence to be around 70%. Truly unfortunate. It makes me embarrassed to be an American. 

\-	There are rules capping capacity at restaurants, hotels, and other “activities” like scuba diving. None of the places I visited was anywhere near full capacity. Now, whether that’s because everyone follows the rules in Mexico or because there just simply weren’t many tourists is not a judgement I’ll make. 

\-	I was not required to show a negative COVID test. Nor was there any mandatory quarantine. States in Mexico are implementing their own rules, so check before you travel. 

**Costs:** 

\- Each dive (including equipment rental) was around 40 USD.

\-Meals:  I avoid the touristy restaurants when I can. Cost of an entree at a casual touristy place was around 10 USD. Obviously it can cost much more than that if you are looking for a fancy place. Cost of 3 tacos in a taco stand is around 3 USD. 

\-Hotels and flight were mostly book on points. My 2-3 star hotel was around 44 USD per night. 

\-Car rental was around 35 USD per day. 

\-Isla Mujeres whale shark trip was 200 USD. 

**To my fellow divers** – the Cozumel forum on Scubaboard is pretty active and a great places to get dive-specific info.  

**To fellow travelers who plan on going to Cozumel** – the rules are constantly changing, so check before you go. The facebook group Cozumel4You was a great resource. Be safe, be responsible. 

**To those who think I should “stay the fuck home”** – stay the fuck home and keep these beautiful places uncrowded for the rest of us.

vintage solo trip report: driving the US I-5 &amp; 101 west coast,"This happened years ago, but I want to send out encouragement to US-restricted solo travelers: it's possible to have amazing experiences, you can do it.


I had a month of free time between jobs, and my level of budget/adventure at the time was a solo road trip in my mid-90s Honda. I'm based in Oregon, so my first stop was at my grandma's house in southern Oregon. I stayed for a few days and we had a great time. Attractions in this area include Crater Lake national park, the Rogue river, and a wildlife park that advertises the most successful cheetah breeding program in America.


I drove south on I-5 (Mt Shasta yas!) and met a friend in Stockton who guided me through winding mountain roads in the dark to an amazing house owned by his relatives in the Sierra Nevada, where we met up with other friends and spent the weekend wine tasting and hanging out. I woke up early and wandered out to the deck, where I was surrounded by hummingbirds. Highlights of this area include Calaveras Big Trees state park and Bear Valley ski resort, neither of which I visited.


On to L.A. for the next few days! I drove the I-5 over the Grapevine and couchsurfed with friends. Venice Beach and Santa Monica!! Had dessert and walked on the beach. I left my wallet in El Segundo at a coffee shop, but I got got got got it back (thx to the coffee shop staff!).


I drove north on the 101 from Malibu to San Francisco, where I stayed with a family friend for a few days. We watched TV, shopped and had a great time together. S.F. is a wonderful place to visit. I explored Amoeba Music, the Haight-Ashbury district, Golden Gate park...!


From S.F., I continued driving N on Hwy 101, through agricultural communities in northern CA and southern OR, it was gorgeous and slow and the coastal views were amazing. Highly recommended.",solotravel,charmparticle
A covid-fun trip report flying to Taiwan,"So seven days ago, I moved to Taiwan for a year to work and hide from covid. This was not a holiday but a one way flight and trip to stay here until my contract is up. Below is a lengthy summary of how I got to one of the safest covid countries in the world and enduring one of the strictest quarantines:

I was staying in New York with my family for six months, experiencing the horrors of what once was the epicentre of the pandemic. My trip to Taiwan began by securing an N95 and a surgical mask to my face, along with goggles - a set up that would stay on my face for 24 hours, during one Uber, one airplane, two airports, and one taxi to my quarantine in Taiwan. JFK's Terminal 1 was like a ghost town. The only flight leaving that night was to Taipei.

Previous flights to Taiwan were practically empty (25% capacity), my flight was 60/70% full with a few middle seats left empty. 16 hours was a long time in the air and I was paranoid about removing my mask so I only removed it to drink water and eat. Luckily, I was served a special meal that allowed me to eat 30 mins before everyone else took off their masks.

I arrived dreary-eyed at Taipei Taoyuan International Airport. Two lines formed as we touched down: one with people who did not own Taiwanese sim cards and those who did. We were required to purchase government tracked sim cards for 30 days. After passing through immigration and picking up my suitcases, I was zipped down to my quarantine hotel in the centre of Taipei.

My room came with 48 bottles of water, four boxes of tissues, alcohol santizer, washing powder, sheets, and three meals a day. I have to stay inside for 15 days in this room. I receive daily texts from the government confirming if I have symptoms or not. Calls from government employees every four days. Fines from 1000 to 10,000 USD if I leave the room.

I've got five days left and will be promptly leaving this room one minute past Friday midnight to a bar to drink and celebrate my end of quarantine.",solotravel,xianggangren

Firstly, thank you for this community, I've learnt a lot from the posts here and helped me plan this trip too. This will be my second solo trip, first one being in Central Europe. I'm looking to understand if this trip is feasible and what changes would you recommend.

Interests:  Adventurous activities (bungee jumping, kayaking, and anything that will involve ""doing"" something. Also enjoy good sights and natural beauty (small hikes but nothing crazy). I (25M) do enjoy partying, so hoping by next summer I can have good social experiences at hostels. I also would like to have a few days for down days where I don't want to do much. Going to have some in Portugal but looking for suggestions of where I can have those later in the trip as well. Also interested in trying out different foods in these countries.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think I need to add/cut? I do think Japan could have more time but I will probably do a second trip during Cherry Blossom season so will try to cover more then.

Leap of Faith (in Myself),"With everything going on in the world I've decided to jump into uncertainty. I've solo traveled in the past but never without a solid plan. Inflexible dates, obligations, and expectations have stunted my growth and sense of wonder as well as my faith in myself. I always return to a job I hate in the same city I was born in. 

I need to realize that life continues whether plans work out or not. I need to take a leap and trust that I'll be ok. I'm smart, resourceful, and open to new experiences and opportunities. I'll never truly be alone or without help if I really need it, as my friends and family are always there to lend a hand. They know that I am responsible and worthy of trust. 

With the pandemic still in full swing, my U.S passport is more or less worthless so I've decided to explore my own backyard so to speak, and road trip the lower 48 with the money I have saved. I'll be doing various workaways, both paid and unpaid, sharing my skills and learning new ones. I'm looking forward to making new connections and experiencing different ways of life. 

I've arranged for someone to take over my lease, downsized my belongings, and invested in essentials for car camping and sustainable travel. I quit my job and told my family and friends that I'm leaving the city. 

With no clear end, this is not a conventional approach. I am afraid of so many aspects of this journey; interpersonal interactions, providing inadequate help, running out of money, car trouble, being underprepared, etc. and those around me are just as apprehensive, but we all have an understanding that this is a journey I need to take. I need to grow and prove to myself that I can live and enjoy life.

I need to learn to trust myself.

I'm starting out with a mini-adventure to test the waters. The month of November and potentially half of December will be spent doing workaways on the east coast. Then I'll be returning home for the holidays and heading out west for longer-term opportunities. Wish me luck y'all.",solotravel,cjwellz13

How do I come out my shell more when solo travelling?,"Hi all,
            I think I need a little encouragement. I'm 28M from the UK. I started solo travelling when I was 25 and done 7/8 trips alone so far. 

However I find for some reason I really go into my shell when abroad alone instead of coming out my shell (god knows why). So I've never really interacted properly with anyone or met new friends on these countless trips and always come home kicking myself feeling like I've missed an opportunity. I feel I miss out on experiences as well as part of this. 

The thing is, back home I'm a really social and laid back guy. So I'm not sure why I can't translate this into the way I act when I'm abroad. Its like I get social anxiety only when abroad. 

I'm headed to Germany in a few days and really want to throw myself in the deep end. I'm considering a hostel dorm but still apprehensive (silly I know). I also want to push myself to meet people. 

It's most likely been covered before but how has solo travel helped you come out your shell and is there any tips you can give me for basically overcoming social anxiety and meeting people and experiencing amazing things while solo travelling. 

Thanks.",solotravel,Dr_Nuggets_
Advice on travel by cargo ship,"Hi all, 

I'm thinking of planning a trip to India in the near-ish future (post the rona anyway, so not that soon). I thought it might be interesting to do some of the trip by cargo ship. Most likely the part from the Middle East to India. I've been looking at a few sites and I know its possible but seems quite pricy, although the prices seem to fluctuate a bit. 

I was wondering if anyone here has done a similar trip and can share their experiences or could give me some tips?

"A few solo days in Colorado, what towns have epic scenery and fun social aspect?","I'll be in Colorado soon meeting some friends at the front end of the trip. We will hit some of the major parks. At the tail end of my trip I am doing some work in Denver. In between I have a few days on my own and I want to visit a great place to hike and meet people. I would greatly appreciate your advice! I'm trying to tick two boxes here:

1 - epic scenery during day hikes

2 - great place to chill, eat great food, and socialize with new people in the afternoon/evening. leaning towards places that have youngish crowds 20s-30s

The first one has been easy, no shortage of sites and recommendations online. But the second I just don't know about and having a harder time getting clarity on. Vail, Telluride, Aspen, Colorado Springs...any of these fit the bill? Or other recommendations?

Edit: thanks for the suggestions. These are great. 

To address the comment about pandemic, I get that concern. I’m not looking for parties and big crowds. That’s part of the reason I skipped Labor Day weekend. Trying to keep it laid back and just looking for a town that doesn’t shut down quickly in the evening (had that experience in Durango). I want to be able to still stay engaged with the local scene, try local restaurants, perhaps a brewery, etc.

I’ve stayed quarantined since March and was the first one to encourage work from home in March to my team before it became common. I wear a mask everywhere if I have to leave the house for groceries and essentials and will continue to practice safety. I even got tested just last week to be certain I’m not an asymptomatic carrier. I was  hesitant to travel but i am trying to stay responsible and enjoy myself too.

Thanks again for the suggestions it’s much appreciated. Looking forward to exploring your amazing state.",solotravel,loopernova
Affordable options for accommodation to break up a long road trip (USA),"I’ve been really enjoying wandering around the region but the cost of motels and Airbnb’s at nightly rates is really starting to become an issue. I also think staying a week or more in the same place makes for a better experience in principle, without having to sublet an apartment or give up too much freedom (I guess I’m on the road “till covid is over” and who knows what that means at this point!)

I’ve explored Airbnb (including their new “longer stays” option which is monthly), VRBO, Hipcamp, and hostels (many with dorm beds are closed). I don’t know how Craigslist is these days, but if there are any similar options that have a bit more of a security net in terms of vetting hosts or having someone to turn to if things go wrong.

Occasionally there are roadside motels that turn out to have a much cheaper weekly rate but it’s really hard to find out about those type of things if you haven’t already wound up staying there for a few nights by chance.

Looking for a quiet one month beach rental in South East Asia.,"Around this time next year, if everything is settled with COVID, I am wanting to get a one month rental on a quiet beach or small island. Most likely Thailand but happy to travel anywhere in South East Asia.

Does anyone have any recommended locations? This is going to be the start of a long travel trip for me and I'm hoping to use it to give my mind some unwind time from work before I start my trip.

Ideally the island won't be too busy, definitely not a party island.

Traveling solo for first time to Crete,"Hi everyone, I will be traveling in about 13 days for about 2 weeks to Crete (May stay longer but not sure yet) I have a full time job and I have a week and half off, and my boss told me I can work remote there if I wish. My questions are, what do you suggest for Crete ? I know I will go on some boat trips and elafonisi, the gorges, kayaking, paddle boarding, maybe balos lagoon, snorkeling, fishing. I will be staying in chanios. 

I’m trying to figure out if I should rent a car or not, one air bnb host told me the buses are running at lower frequency cuz of corona?

I’m also wondering how expensive water sports and such are ? Decently cheap that I can run off for the day and not pay too much ? 

I’m also a little worried I may not be able to go if cases increase in the next 2 weeks?

Is WiFi good there ?

Older travellers staying in Dorms.,"Hi all, i hope this post finds you all well.

I'm heading out on the road for a year long trip across europe to asia sometime next year and whilst i don't want to plan too much i do like to have an idea of the route i'll take and in particular how much the trip is going to cost me.

So part of the number crunching involves working out accommodation costs and it looks like this will be the major cost of my trip until i hit central asia and beyond.....unless i stay in dorms which would bring costs down considerably.

Thing is i have never stayed in a dorm....i've travelled to over 100 countries and consider myself well travelled but aside from the last year all my trips have been with the ex-wife and now i'm venturing out on my own and i can't wait.....but dorms??!!

So whats the opinion of dorms for the slightly more mature posters here?...do you still stay in them? whats the reception like for an older guy (mid-50's) staying in a dorm?

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't be staying in dorms exclusively but it makes sense if i'm passing through for just a couple of days to keep the costs down....i'm ok with it but i have a mortal dread of rocking up at a hostal and its party-central with late-teen,early 20's crowd....i would hate that. I'm not a prude but i wouldn't now want to hang around with my 20 year old former self.

For me, it was while waiting at the main bus terminal in Malacca, Malaysia for a bus to the airport. It was around midnight and the indoor area was closed so I had to wait outside. Luckily it wasn't cold, because Malaysia, but it still wasn't the most comfortable experience having to wait outside for 2+ hours in the middle of the night. There wasn't a lot of people there and I was probably the only foreigner. Of the people present, there were two teenage boys waiting nearby. After some time, they went to the convenience store and then approached me offering a water bottle. We didn't speak much but I remember feeling so touched by their random kindness. That moment is one of the reasons why I remember Malaysia so fondly. :')

Tips on traveling through Nordic Europe?,"Like many other people, covid has made me really tired of my surroundings and I really want to have an experience in a place that’s very different from where I’m currently stuck. I (18f) am planning on doing a solo trip to the Faroe islands, Norway and Sweden. This is going to be my first solo trip but I’ve done a fair bit of international travel with family before, so I feel quite experienced. I’ve made a tentative itinerary for 30-40 days during May or June, either in 2021 or 2022, whichever covid allows. 

A few things:

* Due to my age and relative driving inexperience, I am not going to rent a car. I understand that this is particularly difficult to do in the Faroe islands, so I plan to go with a tour for the most part. 
* I’m not a partier or avid drinker and much prefer to see nature or experience the culture of each city.
* Since I’m also going to be a full time student, traveling during the spring and summer is my only option if i want to go for an extended period of time for the next 4 years.
* I’ve spent the last 3 years working so i’m prepared to spend around $7000 - $8000 Canadian for hostels, flights, entertainment, food, and transport
* I don’t have a desire to go out to many restaurants, bars, etc and want to buy most of my food from local grocery stores.
* I love nature, but I’m not an experienced hiker, camper or skier. I mostly want to do moderate hikes, kayak, see museums, local concerts, etc.

My itinerary is as follows:

**Tromso** (4 days)

Fly to **Trondheim** (4 days)

Fly to **Bergen** (4 days)

Bus or ferry to **Flam** and explore neighbouring fjords (7 days)

Train to **Oslo** (4 days)

Train to **Goteburg** (4 days)

Train to **Stockholm** (5 days)

Plane to **Faroe islands** (7 days)

Specific questions:

Is it worth it to visit Tromso even if I won’t be able to see the northern lights due to the time of year of my visit? Then I would visit more of western Norway instead, like Alesund. 

Is this doable on my budget, what unexpected expenses should I account for?

How reliable is the public transport?

Possible to survive on 20k~35k a year in SE Asia?,"Obviously not for now but just doing research for the future.

My income right now is around 125k a year in Los Angeles so it's definitely going to be an adjustment, but definitely would sacrifice it for a year or two of traveling and doing what I love the most.

"Montreux - what to see, top attractions","Swiss Riviera on the shores of Lake Geneva - Montreux! Why you need to go there, what to see and where to go in Montreux and the surrounding area, as well as how to get there and where to live.

The pandemic disrupted my travel plans a little, but the whole rhythm of life. And that was a big blow to me. During 2019 - early 2020, I traveled almost non-stop, making only rare stops in Kiev (I'm from Ukraine).

One of the most striking travels is the Swiss Alps, Lake Geneva and the part of France that borders Switzerland. Today I will tell you about Montreux, a trip to this city was largely due to my local friends. Thank you guys!

# The main attractions of Montreux

Montreux is a very small city and I cannot say that it has the beauty that we are used to seeing in ancient European cities. Montreux is more modern than historical. Usually my main criterion for evaluating a city is whether I want to return? So you want to come back to Montreux again and again, or even better - stay here for a while.

If time is short, just walk along Lake Geneva, this will be enough to fall in love with Montreux. You can heighten your senses by looking at the city and the surrounding Alps from the water with a glass of champagne or local dry white.

The main thing in Montreux is the views of Lake Geneva and its surroundings and stories associated with famous people who have visited the city at different times - from royalty, musicians and actors to famous prisoners.

# Chateau Chillon fortress

A 13th century fortress that stands on a small island in Lake Geneva, but actually on the shore. Undoubtedly, Chillon Castle is the main architectural attraction of Montreux.

It is best to look at the fortress from the water.

The main function of the castle of the fortress in antiquity was the family estate of the Counts of Savoy in the Middle Ages. The second function is a prison where many famous prisoners were kept.

***Location****: Avenue de Chillon 21, Veitaud / Montreux, Switzerland, just a few minutes drive from the city center, I walked pretty quickly.*

# Jazz Festival in Montreux

The world's number one landmark event. Somewhere it is abruptly even the Olympic Games in sports. I was both lucky and unlucky at the same time - I got to Montreux on the eve of the festival, literally a week before the start and saw all the preparations and the beginning ""movement"", but the travel schedule did not allow me to stay.

The festival was called jazz in its origin - it was conceived as jazz. But after 1970, such luminaries of the rock scene as Queen, Frank Zappa, Deer Purple were its active participants.

Remember the famous Smoke on the water Deep Purple? The song was written in memory of the event when the casino burned down in Montreux in 1971 just during the performance of Frank Zappa. Thick white smoke drifted over Lake Geneva, which inspired Gillan to write this song.

Miles Davis, Nina Simone and Ella Fitzgerald have performed at the festival at various times; after the 1970s, non-jazz artists such as Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, BB King, Oscar Peterson and others participated in it.

The festival can also be viewed free of charge from a boat or boat on Lake Geneva.

***Location****: Avenue Claude Nobs 5, Montreux, Switzerland, right on the shores of Lake Geneva.*

# City promenade in Montreux

The promenade is a 3.5 km long pedestrian road. from the Château de Chillon to Clarence. There are many flowers along the promenade, so the best time to walk is in spring. Each view from the boardwalk is a postcard, especially in calm weather, when the reflections of the castle and mountain peaks are especially beautiful.

***Location****: Along Lake Geneva, Montreux, Switzerland*

# Queen studio

In Montreux, the studio of the Queen group was located - Montreux Mountain, 7 albums of the group were recorded here. After Freddie's death, a sculpture of a musician was installed on the Montreux quay.

***Location****: Casino Barrièrede Montreux, RueduTheatre 9, Montreux, Switzerland*

# Gorge du Chauderon

In the old town is the beginning of the hiking trail along the gorge du Chauderon. The gorge is carved by the river La Baye-de-Montreux, which flows into Lake Geneva. The trail leading to and from Montreux is clearly marked.

***Location****: Old Town, Montreux, Switzerland*

# Lamp trail Les Pléiades

A non-trail path in Les Pléiades, which is called a lamppost for the fact that there are lanterns along it that illuminate the path.

The Lantern Trail is the main winter attraction in Montreux. I knew about her, so I included this attraction in the list.

It is better to walk along the lamppost path in winter, when the light of the lanterns is reflected in the snowdrifts, giving it a slight mysticism.

***How to get there****: To get on the trail you need to take the train from Montreux train station to Les Pléiades station. We leave and follow the signs along the trail illuminated by lanterns. Better to rent snowshoes. End your walk with a Swiss fondue tasting at Les Pléiades.*

***Address****: Les Pléiades, Montreux, Switzerland*

# Lavaux Vineyard Terraces

Lavaux vineyards are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Tourists love them not for the lists, but for the panoramic views along the path and for the wine cellars where you can taste everything that is produced from local grapes.

Do you know why Swiss wine is not sold in your country? Because the Swiss drink almost everything they produce. So say the Swiss themselves, if anything. But at home, in Kiev, I did not see a lot of Swiss wine.

The Lavaux vineyards are 830 hectares between Lausanne and Montreux. Most use the Lavaux Express or Lavaux Panoramic special trains. But it is better to walk along the trails along the vineyards.

***Location****: Lavaux Vineyard Terraces, Puidu, Switzerland*

# Daffodil trail

This attraction is also in our bookmarks if we get to Montreux in the spring. There are many flower trails in the surrounding mountains. The tourist office of the city has maps with marked trails, or use any cartographic service - there are routes there too.

# Walk on Lake Geneva

I left this activity for dessert. The views from Lake Geneva are not at all like what we see from the shore. It is ideal to combine both walks, water and walking. Be sure to take a boat trip to the Lake Geneva Conservation Area - there is a lot of wildlife, birds and aquatic life.

On Lake Geneva, you can rent any small boat - from a water catamaran or canoe to a boat. You can take a ticket for a pleasure boat, but the privacy of the moment is violated, you will have to ride with a crowd of tourists.

**I was lucky** \- I admired Montreux on a private motor boat.

# Conclusion

Montreux definitely has a lot to see and have fun for the solo tourist. If you are from Europe, especially Eastern Europe, I strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself in your free time.

This is my first such major post, I will be glad to hear your criticism and suggestions. Thanks for your attention!

***Pleasant journey, friends.***

# P.S. A few words about travel insurance

You do not need insurance to enter Switzerland, but for your own confidence and wallet safety it is a must! Treatment in Switzerland is very expensive, besides, insurance saves you from having to look for a clinic or run for medicines, you never know what can happen. So take care of everything in advance and your journey will go smoothly.",solotravel,CoolKidsBlogs

Working and learning a language.,"Hi guys,  
I'm taking a break while studying and looking to go work abroad for a year. I live in Belgium and am studying finance and insurance. The reason I'm taking a break is because I feel that I need to get out of my routine and go find myself. I am not completely sure if I am who I am (if that makes sense to anyone). A friend of mine went to Australia for a year and came back full of motivation and knowing what he wanted to achieve in life. I'm not saying that the same will happen to me. But if I don't do this now I will never do it.  


I was planning on going to the south of France for at least 8 months. I have a lot of experience as a bartender. But I do have some concerns. My french is not great so I'm also going to learn a new language and culture. I however don't know how to begin. I've looked at workaway and found some nice places to stay for my first 2 months. I'm not sure if it is a good idea to buy a membership. Does anybody have any experience with this site. I have some money saved but I will need to work. Do the people of workaway pay a salary because I can't seem to find anything about it on the site itself.

I will be living in France for a long time so I need a place to rent, I don't know if that is easy to do especially during this pandemic. Does anybody here have any experience on how the local bars welcome foreign workers. Or if anybody has any tips on stuff I should really have or things I should do prior to my trip.

Cooking While Traveling In a Camper Van?,"I'm looking for advice on cooking while I am out camping in Colorado for a week. I am traveling in a camper van that comes equipped with a single burner gas stove and a frying pan. I'm fairly certain there is a fire pan in effect in the state of Colorado so I don't think I will be able to use an open fire for cooking. I will be staying in various campgrounds. I'll eat pretty much anything.

My main concerns are whether or not the food will store well for the 7 days I am traveling and whether or not they will leave waste /smells that will attract wildlife? The last thing I want is to wake up to a bear trying to get in the van or hanging out around the site.

I will have a cooler and I can probably find places to get ice fairly easy so that should help with storage, but I don't want a lot of strong smells since the van is a rental and there are wild life concerns.

I imagine most campsites will have areas where I can properly dispose of any waste like cooking grease or things of that nature but I would like to be sure before I do.",solotravel,saltynalty17

This is exactly why I travel solo,"I always travel alone because either friends don't have enough money or the time. I traveled a week ago to cancun with my supposedly best friend and it was horrible! I wanted to kill her the first day. She got super drunk, vomited everywhere and embarrassed me every single day. I wasn't able to enjoy my vacation at all, she wanted to constantly eat when I just wanted to chill, be by the pool and look at the ocean. Ugh honestly I wish I didnt go with her. We are not talking anymore and this ruined our friendship. Im definitely going back solo traveling again! I can do what I want when I want to.

Edit: what I shared with you guys was something small. We talked prior to the trip and she is awful at communicating so I would literally have to read her eyes to know what was happening. I would want to be alone with other people I met but she will be following me all the time. There was a lot of drama which I hate, fights with other people among other things. 

I know we are both at fault so you guys can stop insulting me. The purpose of this post was to say why I travel solo nothing else. I do get drunk but I dont need anyone to take care of me thats the difference.

7-10 days solo trip in Nothern Italy,"So I want to lay off some pressure by going solo for a week / 10 days in Northern Italy in mid september (I think probably 7 to 17 sept, or something like that).

What sparked your interest to travel?,"I'm sure everyone has a moment where they knew they were meant to travel and explore..These moments are special and definitely keeps us ignited. 

Personally, when I was a child, I used to LOVE riding the airplane, sitting at the window, and gazing at sky. It was magical. I remember the day before every flight I couldn't sleep because of how excited I used to be to reach the airport and explore the *very* expensive shops there, ride on a plane and think to myself what should I eat this time(I LOVE bread and butter), and most importantly just opening the window and getting lost in the view.

Even now, I am 19 F, and trying my best to have a side hustle, save up money, learn languages, and go abroad for couple of years. I used to envy my friends who travel to study abroad! (I still do lol)

Missing Ireland,"I'll get right into it. I haven't really traveled this year, my last travel was a cruise to mexico in Dec 2019 with my GF and my god I regret cruises, nothing against them they just aren't my thing. ANYWAYS, I woke up in one of those depressed moods today and in attempt for a pick me up I decided to pick up my favored drinks from when I studied abroad in Ireland. Guinness and Carlsberg, my two favorite beers while I was there. As I sip away I am reminded of great nights with great friends and freedom. 

I don't know if anyone else feels the same but, there is such a genuine sense of freedom and happiness when I traveled abroad. Thousands of miles from anyone who knows you and you can just be yourself and live such a genuine life. When I studied abroad I went without knowing a single person and the ability to just live is something I have missed every single day since. The ability to not worry about any expectations or any responsibilities except for the ones I chose. 

For me Ireland was what hooked me on solo travel and I miss it so much at this moment, more than I am proud to admit (probably why I am here talking on reddit). I don't know if its just me or if its something inherent with your early 20's where you are just going through some kind of quarter life crisis but idk, does anyone else feel this way?

Trip report: Rome + Milan,"Hi all,  

I just got back from a week in Italy, where I spent 4 days in Rome and a day in Milan. 

I ended up flying into Milan from London and then catching a train to Rome. This was due to flight prices and availability as a result of the last-minute nature of my trip. 

Getting through security in both airports was quick and painless. I suspect this is because there are fewer travellers ~ a common theme on this trip. 

On arrival in Milan, I had to fill out a piece of paper listing the details of the trip (e.g. address of accommodation etc.) for COVID. I took the Malpensa express into the city centre of Milan, which takes around an hour.

From there, I took a _Frecciarossa Express_ train down to Rome. This took around 3 hours. It was a comfortable journey down where there were many empty seats. I had all four seats and a table for myself. You are asked to wear a mask for the whole journey. They provided a pack (gloves, mask, sanitiser, water etc.) on the train.

## Rome

### Accommodation

I stayed in an Air-BnB in _Trastevere_ for the duration of the trip. The restaurants were operating and there was some nightlife (people hanging around, buskers etc.). It took about 15-30 mins to get into the city centre on foot, depending on where I was trying to get to. Generally, public transport was not that convenient from where I stayed. I did get two Ubers when I was worried I was going to be late (i.e. the first tour and the train back to Milan).

If I went again, I think I would try to stay in Monti. Currently, you can get some good deals accommodation wise.

### Weather

The weather in Rome is very warm. It reached mid-thirties (Celsius) every day by noon. This meant I was always wearing short and a t-shirt. It also meant I was drenched in sweat from all the walking. It stayed warm late into the night. Thankfully, I had AC in my flat. There are also mosquitoes, so don't make the mistake of leaving the windows open! 

### Sights

I did two paid walking tours on two separate days:

- Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill
- The Vatican, Sistine Chapel and St Peter's Basilica

There were about 10-15 people on both tours. All the sights were pretty light on tourists and there wasn't much of a wait to get into any of the sights. As an anecdotal comparison, our tour guide said usually there would be 40 tour groups at the meeting spot before our Vatican tour. We were the only tour group there. 

As a result, it was an amazing experience being able to see the sights in such comfort. All the sights were open from what I understand.

I normally do the free walking tours (with the tipping at the end), but the paid ones came with tickets to get into the sights and a very informative guide in my case. The company I did them with is _City Wonders_.

### Foodies

I love to cook/eat and it's always a big part of my holidays. FYI, every restaurant requires you to wear a mask upon entering the restaurant.

Here are the places I went to and can recommend:

- Roscioli Salumeria con Cucina ~ **everything** for lunch or dinner! 
  - I had the carbonara, but this place is a must in my opinion. I wished I had more time to go a second time!
  - Call ahead and book as it is popular. Solo travellers can get a spot at the bar. 
  - It is the only place that was a little pricy but well worth it.
- Bonci Pizzarium ~ **pizza** and deep-fried breaded balls with fillings inside. 
  - Best to do this the same day you go the Vatican as it's that side of town. 
  - It's more a hole in the wall/takeaway joint but there are some stand-up tables outside.
- Otaleg ~ **gelato** - very nice flavours of ice cream or sorbets. Great relief in the heat. 
  - It's in _Trastevere_, so maybe tie it in with a meal from around there, e.g. Pizza from _Da Poeta_.
- Da Bucatino ~ Cacio e pepe! Rich and creamy. 
  - I would say the food was good, but there wasn't much around the area that I saw. I ended up in the area after exploring.

I had good food at a few other places randomly with travellers I met and they were delicious but maybe not worthy to go out of the way for.

Generally, I think everyone should try the 4 classic pasta dishes when in Rome ~ _Cacio e pepe_, _Carbonara_, _Amatriciana_ and _Alla gricia_. The wine was also amazing, although I am not much in the way of a wine connoisseur. ;)

-----

## Milan

I ended up with half a day as there was a delay on the train back from Rome. I stayed at a hotel next to the Milano Centrale train station for convenience as I had to get to the airport for an early flight the next day.

I went for a walk to see the Cathedral ~ _Duomo_. It is impressive even without going inside. I didn't seem much else as the weather turned.

Aside from that, I just had dinner at _Ratana_, which was amazing. Great food and wine. I had the _Milanese risotto with veal_ and for desert the _watermelon granita_. Both were amazing. Slightly pricy but worth it as my final meal in Italy.

Hope this helps someone!",solotravel,pwee167

How did your budget compare to what you actually spent? (SEA),"I'm worried that my estimates are too low and I'll need to spend more than I actually have.

I have £8k available and want to travel for at least 6 months (7 countries) but was wondering if I somehow managed to stretch it to 10 months, would I just be over budgeting and ruining my experience?

I'll be staying in the cheapest hostels, eating street food mostly and will be taking cheaper transport seeing as I have no time limit. I will be doing semi-expensive tours but not often. For the most part I enjoy aimlessly walking around, drinking coffee, museums, beaches, hikes, taking photos... all the free stuff.  I also can't see myself drinking/partying.

I even told the priceline rep why would I pay $1000 to reschedule my flight when I can just buy a one way with the exact same route from your priceline website for only $750... and the rep said our website is negotiated prices, we're only authorized to give you retail prices.... so then I went on google flights and even still the price for that route was $930 still lower than the $1500 priceline is trying to charge me. I wouldnt mind the 930, but to charge $1500 which is 100% higher than their own website prices and higher than retail price is just absurd. My return flight that I need to reschedule is in 4 days and Im running out of time and no where to turn to. Ive spent almost 5 hours the past 2 days talking to endless reps and this is my first time traveling international and have not much options at this point.

Edit: I didnt mention that I was originally quoted $973 minus 500 credit to change my flight but call got disconnected with priceline rep. And when I called back within the hour, they said price is now $1500 and when I told them how in the world did the price change +100% within 30 mins for a ticket scheduled 1.5 months later, they said prices are always fluctuating... then I said fine give me another route... and the rep quoted me the same, $1500.


The type of ticket I have was a flexible economy ticket so it allows no-hassle rescheduling as long as I pay the difference in the ticket price however the only issue is that only priceline is authorized to change my ticket and Im not authorized to do so with the airline directly.",solotravel,finaldestan1

1) As someone who is in line to move to Cape Town (post-COVID) for his internship (3-6 months) in Social Work i am curious to learn how simple/difficult it is to travel within South Africa (Cape Town as my home for the time there) to places like Johannesburg/Durban/Kruger NP/ Cape Winelands/ etc \[Bus/Train/Car etc, any experiances are great\]

2) Also if anyone has any experiances traveling to Lesotho, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), Mozambique and Namibia from Cape Town, and how those experiances were: i will only have 15 days holiday during my time in South Africa so will have to choose within the reasonable and possible :/ I am currently Leaning towards Eswatini-Mozambique-Kruger NP as one larger trip, but would like input from others before planning anything

Working while travel around the States,"I will be working from home till the end of the year at least. My work only requires my laptop and an internet connection. My plan is to leave the Chicagoland area, head northwest and check out some national parks, eventually making my way south, then to loop back home. 

My question is for those have done something similar, what is the best way to accomplish this? My biggest hurdle would be having an internet connection during the hours I need to work  (8am - 4/5 pm cst). I know I can find hotels/ lodging with internet but checkout times typically would be before my end of day.

I’m about to turn 30, while I don’t really have any plans or desire to have kids  right now sometimes I wonder if I’ll still be able to travel by myself... obviously not to the extent of long-term trips.

Story time! Dropping phone in river in Japan.,"Last year I went on my first solo trip in Japan, I had the time of my life. I spent 23 days in total. I went to Tokyo (14days), Kyoto (3days), Osaka (3 days), and Nikko (3 days).

Anyway it was my first day in Nikko , I was staying a pretty awesome hostel called Nikko Earth Hostel. It was right on a river, incredible spot really. I was sharing some Sake with some friends I met at the hostel, sitting on the rocks right in front of the river. I had my phone in my pocket, and all the sudden it slides out of my pocket and slides off the rocks into the river. I instinctively jumped in with all my clothes in to try to recover it (it was dark), and I could not find it, being that it would’ve been broken anyway it didn’t matter much.

Keep in mind it’s my first solo trip in a foreign country, let alone one with such a intricate transportation system. My phone was how I navigated the entire trip, so I was freaking out for the first day. Especially because I had to somehow navigate my way all the way from the mountains in Nikko, to my terminal in Narita, with no help. 

It was definitely an experience. Especially because I got sick after jumping in the river, and I couldn’t hear out of my left ear at all, so I had to try extra hard to hear the train announce the stations and such.

I managed to make it to my terminal, and it was honestly a great and empowering experience that I was able to do this all on my own. It added another element to my trip, not constantly looking at my phone for directions. 

I just wanted to share lol :)

Edit: This is the hostel I was staying at if anyone is curious. [Nikko Earth Hostel](https://earthhostel.com/)",solotravel,thatwasntcandy

Resources for travel in Switzerland.,"Not a single trip report, but more of a collection of experience and lessons from many trips. I don't think I have posted this here before, it might be useful in this very long planning period. 

Most of my travel here as day or week long trips has been solo travel. This is probably as safe and easy a solo destination as you are going to get. People hiking or biking across the country by themselves is commonplace, eating isn't a group thing like in some countries, and other than maybe a few activities that require a booking with a minimal group size you won't find yourself excluded from anything. I have never had any problems (though as a white male it might be easier for me to avoid them, I can't speak for other demographics).

The only real factor for me regarding solo travel here has been that if you really want to meet other travelers then it will be much easier at a hostel in a more popular area (ie Interlaken/Luzern/Zermatt) than if you go off to other forms of accommodation in the lesser known regions. There are hostels all over the country, but many (especially the YHAs) tend to attract domestic Swiss tourists of various ages rather than an international scene. 

The Swiss are not going to embrace you like a family member, but are friendly in their own way. I have never had a problem getting help (even without a mutual language), sharing tables at relaxed places like mountain restaurants is quite standard (once all the empty ones are partially occupied), and sometimes they will be very chatty in a way that still surprises me sometimes. Speaking the local language makes it much easier to get talking with people, but English often works everywhere (too well given that I still have issues getting people to talk to me in German sometimes).

* I live in the German speaking area so I am very heavily biased to the sights and culture there just through my daily experience.

* I am a little insufferable at always wanting to be different, so I tend to be a bit harsher on popular/famous places than unknown ones. You should try and mentally correct for that.

**Misc tips:**

* Swiss vs European power plug adapters - not always compatible! If you have an EU plug it might not fit into a Swiss socket, but newer ones should do (roughly speaking when the two prongs are 4mm or less in diameter, and 14mm apart they should work in both the EU and Switzerland).

* Cable cars typically stop running at around 5pm (but can be until 10pm or so if it is servicing a village like Mürren). This is especially deceptive in summer when it stays light until much later. Check when the last run is, the internet is full of stories of people who found themselves with a long walk down in the dark. 

---

**Internet - practical**

Many of these also have a phone app version which is worth having.

General:

* [My Switzerland](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-au/home.html). The official and very extensive tourism website. Just about any information you could possibly need about anything is on here.

* [Wikivoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Switzerland). A bit hit and miss: the overview and coverage for places like Zürich is fantastic, but many places are lacking in useful or any info. 

* Local tourist areas all have their own websites. Usually in both summer and winter versions, giving you info on: conditions, what is open,  ideas for what to do, etc:. Eg: [Jungfrau region](https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/), [Zermatt](https://www.zermatt.ch/en), [Appenzell](http://www.appenzell.ch/en/home.html), and so on.

Transport:

* You can get regional travel passes which cover all transport and cable cars in specific areas (Eg: the [Jungfrau region](https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/jungfrau-travel-pass/), or the [Tell pass](http://www.tellpass.ch/en/summer/experience/whats_the_tell-pass/) around Luzern). Likewise there are endless [passes for museums etc in each region](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/gaestekarten.html). 

* [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html). The website (and also app) for the train network covering buses, boats, and cable cars too. Timetables, ticket info, and pass info. It is sometimes better to look up the timetable for seasonal things like cable cars and boats on their own websites (eg: [BLS boats on Brienzersee](https://www.bls.ch/en/fahren/unterwegs-mit/schiff/fahrplan), or [cable cars in the Aletsch region](https://www.aletscharena.ch/cableways/timetable/)) as when they don’t run the SBB just gives a vague “can’t find the connection” notice. They do various [travel passes](https://www.sbb.ch/en/leisure-holidays/travel-in-switzerland/international-guests.html), though it is best to carefully calculate your planned routes or figure out if it is worth it It is worth looking for the off-peak “super saver” tickets which limit you to a certain train but can cut the price in half (and if you have the half-tax this cuts the price again, to as much as 75% off).   


Accommodation

* Official accommodation (which should include Airbnb) will offer a guest card in many tourist areas including free/discounted local transport and activities. Typically this is just in the town/village and places 10-20 minutes away ([eg for Interlaken]( https://www.interlaken.ch/en/info-service/gaestekarten/interlaken-guest-card)), but in the beautiful and underrated canton of Ticino [it covers the entire canton]( https://www.ticino.ch/en/ticket.html). 

* Aside from the standard options for finding rooms you might also want to look into other options such as https://alp.holidaybooking.ch/?language=en, and https://www.rooms.ch/ . Many smaller independent options (especially farms and rural hotels) are not on Booking.com etc and you will have to find them by trawling around on google maps. This could help if you really want to stay in a certain area but everything is booked out, but many of them have a very basic setup so you might need to phone up or fill in a form on their website.

* Another option that might be worth considering is the [Swiss Hotel Card]( https://hotelcard.com/en?change_locale=en), a 99CHF per year subscription that offers half priced hotel rooms. This is limited to participating hotels and doesn’t apply during the high season, but could easily pay for itself with just a single night or weekend. I have yet to try this, but the range of locations looks like it could be quite good for domestic travellers. 

* For more rural hut and farm based accommodation: https://bnb.ch/ , and https://www.bauernhof-ferien.ch/ , and https://www.myfarm.ch/en/accommodation , and https://naturfreunde.ch/haeuser/ . Some like myfarm.ch offer the chance to sleep on straw in a barn.

* Alpine huts are run by a few different organisations. [The SAC website]( https://www.sac-cas.ch/en/) is the best starting point.

* Camping. Standard campsites: www.tcs.ch , www.camping.ch , and www.sccv.ch. In addition there are a few websites where you can officially find a small patch to pitch up on a farm https://www.nomady.ch/ , and [on myfarm.ch too](https://www.myfarm.ch/de/campingplatz-zeltplatz#dontPreselectRegion=true&amp;resultsPerPage=&amp;tagIds=-3360035520941820).

* Wild camping is complex. The best way to sum it up is ""Prohibited but tolerated under conditions"". [This SAC page has the most official guidelines]( https://www.sac-cas.ch/de/umwelt/bergsport-und-umwelt/campieren-und-biwakieren/). There are some pointers for the ideal situation (the more you follow the better): above the treeline, with the community / landowner’s permission, [not in a protected area]( https://map.geo.admin.ch/?lang=de&amp;layers=ch.bafu.wrz-wildruhezonen_portal,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-auen,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-hochmoore,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-flachmoore_regional,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-flachmoore,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-jagdbanngebiete,ch.bafu.schutzgebiete-schweizerischer_nationalpark,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-trockenwiesen_trockenweiden&amp;layers_opacity=0.9,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75&amp;bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&amp;zoom=0&amp;topic=ech&amp;E=2643780.17&amp;N=1164842.39), single tent, set up as the sun goes down and dismantle at dawn, no fire/noise/disturbance/litter. Wild camping has increased in popularity in recent years, [iconic spots like Seealpsee are having problems with numbers]( https://www.fm1today.ch/ostschweiz/appenzellerland/zu-viele-wildcamper-am-seealpsee-135572094), so try and pick a less known spot.

Weather:

* For weather there is [Search.ch](https://meteo.search.ch/grindelwald) which also includes a few webcams and ski info in winter, or [Meteoswiss](http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/) which has a useful country map.

* There are lots of high-resolution webcams. Check official websites for resorts and cable cars (eg: [Jungfrau region]( https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/live/webcams/)), or [roundshot]( https://www.roundshot.com/xml_1/internet/en/application/d170/f172.cfm) for the best. Useful webcams can also be found at [webcamforinsiders]( https://www.webcam-4insiders.ch/webcam/weissenstein%20bei%20solothurn/1560) and [swisswebcams]( https://www.swisswebcams.ch/).

Maps:

* [Switzerland Mobility](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/summer.html). Detailed map showing all official routes for hiking/biking/skating…. With lots of short and long suggested routes. If you sign up for the (paid) Pro version then you can plan routes on the map with detailed height information and pretty good time estimates. [for example](https://map.schweizmobil.ch/?lang=de&amp;showLogin=true&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;season=summer&amp;resolution=10&amp;E=2746778&amp;N=1236988&amp;trackId=3334166). 

* [map.geo.admin.ch](https://map.geo.admin.ch) (mobile app - Swisstopo). The official govt map is amazing. Quick to load and use on desktop or mobile. You can toggle useful overlays like hiking paths (in some ways better than Mobility above as the levels are shown and the contrast makes it much clearer), and just about anything else from geological features to ski runs, you can even switch to historic versions of the map going back to the mid 1800s and watch the country grow. It will even convert any section you like to PDF for easy saving and printing. All for free.

* When actually out and about I tend to use **Maps.me** on my phone which has rather good coverage of the footpath system and addresses/businesses. That said it does have some big gaps in some areas. I wouldn’t use it for advanced routes, but to check my position and where a certain side path might take me it is mostly very useful. The directions feature sometimes gives good advice and sometimes decides that a perfectly good bit of path can’t be used and that you should take a 3 hour detour. The time calculator does not take height change into account, so do not trust that either.

**Internet - culture**

* [Swissinfo.ch](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng) Swiss news and topics in English.

* [Thelocal.ch](https://www.thelocal.ch/) is more of the same.

* [Newlyswissed](https://www.newlyswissed.com/) is yet more Swiss news with a focus on cultural tips for those adjusting to Switzerland. Though it can be somewhat fluffy click-bait (actually it is mostly pretty crap really).

* Beer. There are apparently more breweries per person in Switzerland than anywhere else in the world. The impressive one man website [Bov.ch](https://www.bov.ch/beer/index-Y.html) maps and is working hard to review them all.

* Music to get you in the mood. Many of the bigger Swiss artists like [Anna Rossinelli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ3T3M22lAA), and [Stefanie Heinzmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WHqq4TmW5k) sing in English (understandable with a slightly bigger potential audience) but there are a surprising number that sing in Swiss-German. In no particular order of name or genre: [Bligg]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixLsLFncL5g) (where else can you see someone rapping and posing on a Zürich skyscraper?), [Kunz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Quf4cT7BR0), [Nemo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hCmUQdDGeE), [Lo und Leduc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APxnaonpOes), [Dabu Fantastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_I8HH2N_qQ), [Züri West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gd4YIFM7ck), [Baschi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghlPjtl7RDY), [Patent Ochsner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzC9oX8O1_M), [Marc Sway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S96gICNe-eE), [De Luca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zoUuLviHHE), [Müslüm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXQlMgiPd8k), [Hedgehog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uCeZx501iU), [Subzonic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cj9iDNWSwQ), [Span](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cGfU4WNoxM), [Mani Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGatIgXERI), [Steff la Cheffe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5YhjiupY08), and [Dodo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6F6KwZa-Es). Having written all that I then just found [this big youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1HrtVjwfFc&amp;list=PLsIqMR6rh5PYeH_HmqkOwzVzl1RBkr5ab). Or if you want to go REALLY Swiss you can go fully native and crash through into the world of [folk-Schlager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReKkGqqYTwU) (at this point you are out-Swissing most of the Swiss who would run up a mountain to avoid that). [This however may be the peak of awful campy self-aware Swissness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwU40AFw9w) (my apologies to every Swiss person who was just reminded about the existence of that). However [this]( https://youtu.be/5zWrb2Oa1cs?t=102) may top that to be the most amazingly bad Swiss thing ever.

* If you speak any of the national languages then the [Swiss broadcasting Corporation]( https://www.srgssr.ch/de/start/) has plenty to offer in each. For example with German there is the SRF is who do a mix of High-German and Swiss-German telly and radio. [SRF Play](https://www.srf.ch/play/tv) is their on demand TV/radio website and app. They are very good at putting their full shows onto youtube - [the main SRF Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SchweizerFernsehen) has quite a bit of content (and there are other [specialised official channels too](https://www.youtube.com/user/SchweizerFernsehen/channels?disable_polymer=1)). Radio podcasts are on [the SRF website](https://www.srf.ch/podcasts) and on Spotify (and probably other places too), for Swiss-German check SRF1 (especially the regionaljournal channels) and SRF3, and for the hardcore the Hörspiel channel often has full plays in Swiss-German.

* [I rather like the SRF archive for the historical videos which can normally be enjoyed without the language.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd0NmHBRRAq5O-ye7kx_VlQ)

-------------------------------


**Books**

* Swiss Watching - Diccon Bewes (2010). Switzerland seen through British eyes. A very readable and enjoyable introduction to the history, people, politics and areas of the country by someone who has lived there for years. Ideal reading as a traveller. There are some over generalisations but given the scope and size it mostly does a good job. If you read anything about Switzerland make it this. [He also has a Google-talk video which is basically a condensed version of the book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7u--e31oOc&amp;) 

* Slow train to Switzerland - Diccon Bewes (2013). The author retraces the first Thomas Cook tour of Switzerland and shows how much has changed since then and by the rise of trains and tourism. A very interesting read for the history and travel ideas. 

* Around Switzerland in 80 Maps - Diccon Bewes (2015).Yet another Diccon book, though this is much more history and culture than travel based. At a large 33x23cm it isn’t travel friendly either, but it is beautifully done with a range of well reproduced images and interesting information. It is accessible and interesting to everyone, but I would say this book is most enjoyable to those who already know the Swiss landscape, history and culture to some extent already. The [TedX talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a480xM9kFyA) that he does on the subject is rather good.

* The [Bergli publisher](https://www.bergli.ch/), which Diccon is part of, have quite a few light hearted books about Swiss culture and Switzerland.

* How the English Made the Alps - Jim Ring (2000). A history of how the development of tourism, climbing, and winter sports played a major role in the development of the Alps. Not just Switzerland, but it is a major focus of the book.

* A Tramp Abroad - Mark Twain (1880). [FREE EBOOK](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/119). Satirical and absurd account of his travels in Europe. The Swiss part is often hilarious. As above is interesting to see just how much the country has changed since then. Several places such as [Weggis-Rigi](https://www.rigi.ch/Vor-Ort/Rigi-Kulm/Wanderwege-ab-Rigi-Kulm/Mark-Twain-Weg) and [Zermatt-Riffelberg](https://www.zermatt.ch/en/Media/Planning-hikes-tours/Mark-Twain-Weg) have Theme walks in the approximate places where he walked himself. A tramp in this sense is to walk, not the homeless person as most people other than the Kiwis might assume.

* Sherlock Holmes - The Final Problem - Arthur Conan Doyle (1893). [FREE EBOOK](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/d/doyle/arthur_conan/d75me/). A quick and easy read of Holmes' ""final"" adventure ending at the Reichenbach falls by Meiringen. He oversells the waterfall somewhat though I must say. 

* The Magic Mountain - Thomas Mann (1924). Inspired by and set in a Davos mountain health retreat. No comment as have yet to read it.

* Heidi - Johanna Spyri (1881). [FREE EBOOK](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781). The classic kids book which seems to be something of cliché and sales-device these days ([for a start you can visit a fake Heidi house in Heidi village](http://www.heididorf.ch/en/about-us/heidis-village.html)). It is only partly happy alpine adventures, and often rather painfully moralistic. Read until she is put on a train to Frankfurt and that should be enough.

* William Tell - Friedrich Schiller (1804). [FREE EBOOK](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6788). Performed every year in Interlaken amongst other places. Frankly it is really blood boring - the whole thing can be summed up that the Swiss are good christian brothers, and the Austrians are utter wankers.

* Bill Bryson passes through in his 1991 book “Neither here nor there”. While still mostly a good read, being almost 30 years old the info is rather outdated in parts. The country has become much more lively since then for a start.

* La Place de la Concorde Suisse - John McPhee (1984). A very out-dated but in some ways interesting read looking at Swiss military thinking and culture back in the 80s. The attitudes and situation are very different now over 30 years later. This is only really worth it if you really want to learn about that bit of Swiss history. It also commits the cardinal sin of having numerous bits of French scattered about the book but with no translation provided, which is really bloody annoying.


If your German is good then:

I would like to see some of the french nature aswell. Any hiking locations that have a walk of about 1 till 3 hours, preferably in the mountains. Since I live in the Netherlands and everything is flat over here, i would prefer to see some rolling landscapes.

I am also interested in the medieval times, specifically the castles / ruines of castles, so any of those that could be recomended would be greatly apreciated aswell.

I am on the other hand NOT interested in going to big cities, they are just not my piece of cake

Just drive off?,"Hello,
I am living in Germany in a pretty big city and I have a pretty good life if I can say so. I have a lot of friends, so a nice private life and I am self employed. 
Still, I often think about just driving off... I don’t really have a clue where to go, probably south. I am French and often went on vacation in places like st tropez. So I would probably go to France, Italy, etc. 
But I don’t know if it’s the right idea, not knowing anybody, with a limited budget.

Leaving corporate life to travel,"  I’ve worked at my office job for about 9 months now and I’ve realized it’s not the right fit for me. Before this I’ve had other office jobs and I thought this would be better because it’s in an industry I’m interested in, but it didn’t really make a difference. Corporate life is what it is at least to me. I’ve worked retail before which I actually prefer, but having managers and dealing with customers gets old after a while.  

  I’m 25 and currently living with family. I feel it’s time for me to be on my own. I’ve looked at places in my city, but I don’t think I even want to live here anymore. I feel I need a change of scenery and new experiences. 

  I started taking an online coaching program on the side to learn how to create an online business where I’m able to work with people one on one remotely. Ideally, I’ll have this up and running by the time I plan to move so it can be my livelihood while I travel. 

  I’m planning to go to Guadalajara for a few months the beginning of 2021. That gives me some more time to save, plan, and for things with the pandemic to hopefully settle down.

  I chose GDL because I have some relatives that live there, I haven’t visited since I was a kid, and I want to perfect my Spanish. I’ve travelled solo many times, but this will be the first time I’ll be gone for more than a couple weeks. I figured this is a safe bet to start off with because I can have my own place and still have family in the city in case of anything. 

  I currently have about 20k saved up. I plan to get global health insurance, so that I’m covered whether I’m traveling or home in the U.S. I’m thinking of staying for at least 2 months and seeing if I want to stay there or go somewhere else. 

  I can always come back home if need be, but I am seeking an independent lifestyle. Does anybody have advice or suggestions on this topic? I’d really appreciate it.",solotravel,leangreenqueen
Travel ideas for first-time solo female traveller?,"Hi everyone, my big plans for 2020 fell through (I was supposed to do an exchange semester at UCLA) and so I have a bunch of money saved up that I would like to use for something nice. I am 21F, have a budget of about 2.5k euros (without flights) and would like to travel outside of Europe. I have never solo travelled before but I am quite a skilled traveler in general (I know to avoid scams etc). I would still like to go somewhere safe though, safety is one of my biggest concerns about this whole solo travel thing but it’s something I would really like to try. I have the whole month of January off from school/work and would like to look into the possibility of travelling then. However, if it’s still very complicated by then to arrange travelling, I would prefer waiting for things to go back to normal as much as possible. I would like to go on a long holiday of at the very least 3 weeks bc I feel like if I invest time and money in a long-haul flight, I should explore the place thoroughly.
For now I’ve checked some flight prices to see where I could actually afford to go, and my best bet seems to be SE Asia. I’ve also researched this online a bit to see where I could go on my budget comfortably and most people are recommending Thailand.
My interests when travelling are visiting monuments/temples or other built heritage, cool natural landscapes (although I am not much into hiking so preferably easily reachable nature), vegetarian(!) food and I am also reaaally interested in Buddhism and would love to learn more about it.
I would appreciate it if you could share some tips or places that you, as women, travelled to and had a good experience in so I get a few ideas of where to look! Thank you.",solotravel,datdashdoe

Solo Cabo Trip End Of September. 28m,"Hi All,

As the title states, I’m heading to Cabo at the end of September for 8 days. I’ll be staying at the Riu Palace (all inclusive). 

My friends either couldn’t afford to go (no judgement) or couldn’t get the time off, so I’m going solo!

I did an Alaskan cruise by myself last year and loved the flexibility of doing whatever I want whenever I want. 

I enjoy my own time, so I’m not too worried about being “lonely”, I’m good enough at making new friends as well if needed. 

My question is, are prices for excursions and activities generally priced for 2 people? Are there going to be any issues with me booking solo excursions?

What are your suggestions for solo excursions? I’d like to do a full day fishing trip, a scuba diving day trip, jet skiing, dune buggying... etc. Anything else you would suggest?

I know it’s one of those things to “not care what others think about you”, but is it weird to go on these dinner cruises solo? 😂

Ethiopia or Argentina?,"Hi there, pending on the manageable situation of the current pandemic, I want to backpack/travel through either Argentina or Ethiopia in April 2021, which country is more worth the visit? Especially in terms of transnational/cross-country travel and backpacking?

Hidden gems in the Netherlands?,"Hey everyone! I (19f) recently moved to Amsterdam and love traveling around the country on my own whenever I have time.

It would be preferred to be able to travel there by train or bus from Amsterdam since I don't have a car. I usually go by foot but if a bike is needed in the area that is also possible :)

My budget is low, basically as low as possible, I would only be paying for the train/bus tickets and some food/drinks. If the place is further away I would consider renting an Airbnb or staying at a friend's place (if I happen to know someone in the area).

"Is there a website to search boat and ferry trips, similar to searching for flights?","As the title suggests. I like to incorporate water transportation (boat, ferry, etc.) into my travels. Whether it is between countries (ex: ferry from South Korea to Vladivostok, Russia) or within a country (Thai islands). Sometimes these options are more expensive and take longer than a flight covering the same distance, but I like to explore ideas anyway. Usually to find these I have to search specific departure and arrival destinations or zoom in on google maps with public transport turned out (ferry services appear as a dashed line). Or I find out about them while reading about an area. Are there any websites that collect information about these routes and schedules from all over the world? Or am I stuck with Rome2Rio searches?

Where are the best spas &amp; thermal baths in the world?,"I noticed that people on this subreddit always ask about the best hostels, best food, best bars, best nightlife, best museums, etc. but no one ever talks about the best spas in the world.

I think travel &amp; relaxation go hand in hand so I always try to visit some spas wherever I visit. Yes, I know, as solo travellers and backpackers sometimes we try to save every penny on the cheapest flights and hostels but it’s OK to splurge on yourself too. 

One of the most famous countries for this is Hungary. Szechenyi Baths, Gellert Baths, etc. are really famous and the architecture there is just gorgeous. But what other countries have amazing spas and baths? One of my cousins visited an outdoor spa in Bali, Indonesia near the mountains and it was the most gorgeous thing I’ve ever seen.

Planning to spend 4-5 months living in 3-4 European cities. TOP choices.,"I am planning to go to Europe in my gap year and spend 4-5 months there. I prefer way much ""slow travel"" in order to soak the culture in, speak the language, meet new people, and actually have a deep experience of the place.
I LOVE history, doing a wide range of activities, meeting new people and speaking their language. I am planning to learn Italian (Currently learning German and French). I want to be able to use these languages when I travel.

I have 3 places in my mind so far and would like your opinion and other recommendations:

1) Berlin: planning to spend 1.5 months here, while still exploring other cities in Germany such as Hamburg, Münich and other ""smaller"" cities. I have a very huge passion for Germany, its history and language. So I may extend the stay here.

2)Rome: Planning to also spend 1.5 months here. I chose Rome because I hear it is underrated and there are LOTS of stuff to do. There are other cities such as Milan and Venice that are also competing for this spot, your input here would be greatly appreciated ;).

3) Paris: Also 1.5 months. Obviously, Paris is the most well known city in Europe ( if not the world lol), but I was wondering are there any other suggestions for French cities to spend at least a month there?  

I will still be interrailing to other places such as Amsterdam, Brussels, Budapest, etc..

What Sized Backpack Should I Purchase?,"Post-COVID I'm going to solo travel to England for six months during autumn and winter. I'm female, and I'm good about packing light. I'm typically a size medium in all clothes.

CLOTHES
2 jeans, 7 t-shirts, 2 sweaters, 1 thermal, 2 bras, 14 underwear, 7 pairs of socks, 2 joggers, 2 beanies, 1 gloves, 1 puffy jacket (worn), 1 collapsable raincoat (day pack), 1 shower shoes, 1 trainers (worn)

TOILETRIES
Travel-sized toiletry bag (shampoo, conditioner, liquid soap, toothbrush, toothpaste, hair ties, deodorant, sink laundry packets, travel towel)

DAY PACK
Tiny umbrella, converter, phone charger, portable charger, tiny first aid kit, dry snacks, wallet, passport, phone, etc.

I plan to stay in hostels, and all I plan to travel with is a big backpack and a day pack. I will bring a collapsible duffel for extra things, which I can leave in Suffolk with a family member.

I'm thinking of getting an Osprey backpack for the trip, but I am unsure of what size would be best. I figure 30l is too small and 40l is too big, but it's hard to tell the actual size from just photos. Any suggestions are appreciated.",solotravel,pieapplekitten

Which countries have you visited that you believe deserve extra time to really get to know?,"After only spending a few weeks individually in all the countries I've visited abroad, I feel that I really want to get to know the next one I visit, instead of just scratching the surface.

- Are walking tours still operating with the current situation? Send your recommendations!
- Are restaurants operating as per normal?

Car-free places to visit in Canada in October?,"I have a money saved up for a small, week long trip in October. For context I’m from Toronto and have already visited Montreal and Quebec City.

Mental impact of covid...maybe you guys get it,"Hey all!

I’m posting here because I’m realizing that during these times, I’m feeling a huge lack of community. I’ve traveled to 49 countries, many of them solo. I have found that many solo travelers have some strange little quirks in common, so I’m wondering if anyone here can relate.

To me, I’m not overly concerned about covid. I’ve eaten street food off plates cleaned in very questionable water in Thailand, I’ve gone without hand sanitizer and toilet paper for months backpacking in South America, I’ve slept in questionably clean hostels all over the world, and laid my cheek on old school bus cushions that HAD to have been at least 50 years old. 

I love the world. And I’m worried. 

I’m the kind of person who loves strangers. I couch surf. I host couchsurfers. I trust strangers, and I rarely worry about people stealing from me or trying to hurt me in some way (I’m 36/f/Canadian). 

I invited strangers to my house for a New Year’s Eve intention setting party. I ran a meetup where we met in each other’s houses - not bars. I like real human beings and real connection. 

I just feel such a lack of community in these times. I am seriously worried that it will never go back to normal. I’m really sad to see that we have just accepted that this is the new normal - because to me, this feels terrible.

It feels like the opposite of the trust I have for strangers. I am scared we are getting comfortable with distance, and I hate it. I fear for my global community, and I’m concerned that things will never be the same. 

It hurts my soul. 

I feel like if I am ever to be able to return to normal, that my practices will be viewed as irresponsible. They were already borderline before. 

I’m curious to hear from my fellow adventure seeking, stranger loving, questionable food eating friends...how are you all holding up?  How are you reconciling this to yourselves?",solotravel,jakeysnakey83

New passport/ COVID-19 help!!!,"Hey all,

I booked a very expensive flight out of the country only to my horror to find my passport had expired. 
I today (8/21/2020) applied at my local usps in Minneapolis and submitted for a new passport. 
While there I learned of the massive delays due to COVID-19 and that it was taking a long time to receive a passport.
My flight is on 10/19/2020.Do I have any hope of getting my passport for my international flight or am I just screwed here. I’m so embarrassed by how easily avoidable this was by just checking my passport first. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Sleeping in airports?,"Hello all! Earlier this week, I impulsively bought plane tickets to los angeles for labor day weekend. My returning flight leave at 5 AM from LAX. I was considering just sleeping at the airport since I have to be there quite early, and also, to save money. Ive never done this, so I really don't know to much about it.. Has anyone done this at LAX? Is it still allowed, with Covid going on. Would I be able to check in 5 hours early? I will not have luggage, only a backpack.

Edit: will probably not be sleeping in the airport. People are up in arms about this, so imagine how people at the airport might react if I actually do it. To be honest, I'm not that worried about the virus (there i said it!), but I always strictly follow the safety protocols to be respectful to the public and to staff, and because i do understand there are some people who are extremely vulnerable to it. 

For people mentioning the wild fires in California, I am coming from a state also dealing with wildfires. The air quality here has been quite unbearable. In fact, the 6,000+  ft drop in elevation in Los Angeles will probably help me be able to breathe a little better! 

I hate to break it to some of you, but people are going to travel (no matter how much you disagree with it). People are tired of being stuck at home. For me personally, I will spend a couple of days alone at the beach, with some good books, and plan to stay put at home (other than doing some camping) after this trip. Ive talked to many people booking flights domestically, and a surprising number of people booking flights to Mexico right now. 

I appreciate all the suggestions! Was not expecting so much feedback. I am planning a more elaborate backpacking trip if the virus ever simmers down, and plan to do some MAD sleeping in airports when that time comes. I will definitely refer back to this thread!",solotravel,breas84

"About to take an epic 8,000 mile, 20 state, 2 month US camper van roadtrip alone - Part 2!","Apologies if you're seeing this twice! I had links to my socials in my last post, so it got taken down, but all of you were being super kind and supportive, answering some of my questions, and providing great advice. I didn't want it to end, so I'm reposting without the links. Apologies again! I'm super excited and wanted to share with likeminded travelers.

OG Post: Next week I'll be starting a once-in-a-lifetime trip. I'm furloughed through the end of the year and renting a camper van so I can responsibly travel and see what nature has to offer. I'll be staying mostly on the Western side of the US. I'll be doing this alone and living/staying in my van, so I will be having little to no interaction with anyone else. The most I will be doing is hiking in our beautiful national parks and keeping my distance from people.

I’ll be renting the Kuga camper van from Travellers Autobarn. General route is from San Francisco, up to Montana, over to ND and down the Great Plains, into the Ozarks, then following 40 most of the way back.

I've started a YouTube travel blog to document and share my stories and have a GoPro and some equipment. I'll be posting and sharing on my Instagram as well. I've also got a Poalrsteps, so my route can be mapped and family members can see where I am. I'm not going to enough National Parks to get one of those passport books. I'll be finding and rating places on iOverlander and Campendium.

I've never done anything like this and don't have much camping experience, so a few questions:

\- Any other technology you'd recommend I set up or start before I leave? I'd hate to find out about some awesome thing to do in each state or some type of tracker and have missed my chance.

\- I don't have a bathroom/shower in the van. I have an outdoor shower which will be fine, but any recs for toilet use are appreciated :)

\- I'll be spending a few days in the Ozarks, which I'm very unfamiliar with, so any recs there would be great!

\- Any big tips for van security? I'm going to have a lockbox/bike lock situation, but since it's a rental van, there isn't much more I can do.",solotravel,Serial_and_Milk
Seasonal jobs while travelling?,"I’m not sure this is the right sub but I’m looking for some ideas and don’t know where else to post.

Advice: Backpacking for 3-4 months with camera equipment.,"Depending on the state of covid next summer I plan on backpacking around Europe &amp; SEA for 3-4 months.

The main goal of this trip is to finally take the trip I’ve been talking about the past couple of years and just enjoy myself. I plan on staying in hostels (with more of a party/social atmosphere). I also decided while on the trip I want to extensively document everything by taking photos and videos/vlogs on my trip to make my own personal travel videos. Also only plan on bringing one big backpack that can fit my clothes and camera equipment in one. 

The reason I am asking for advice is because I have never travelled with any camera equipment or done a long solo trip in multiple countries. I have traveled several times before around Europe so I know what to expect in terms of getting around and staying in hostels. I have done research and decided on a drone, camera, and any extra equipment alongside it that I’ll need. 


MAIN CONCERNS:
First fitting all of my stuff in one bag rather than have two separate bags one for the equipment and one for clothing. Don’t want to overpack and be miserable lugging all of my bags each place I go to.

Second since I plan on staying in shared rooms having to worry about storing my equipment and making sure no one is able to steal it or get there hands on it. I plan on locking it up but have also seen people post about a bag you can lock up and anchor to an immovable object in the room if there isn’t anywhere to store it in the hostel.


QUESTIONS:
If anyone has had any experience with traveling with camera equipment while staying in hostels what is your advice? Is it too much of a hassle to be moving from place to place with it? Anything you would do differently when traveling with gear?",solotravel,jturaoo2

Travelling as a solo female I have questions about safety and about accessibility.
From my research the safest countries seem to be Tanzania, Uganda, Ruanda, Malawi, Zambia and Botsuana, Namibia maybe Ethiopia?

As I can't see all in one trip I'd either go for an eastern or a more southern route.

Namibia for example has stunning landscapes and wildlife but seems to only make sense with renting a car as a group of friends or go with a group tour, as it's apparently not possible to reach the destinations on public transport.


I looked into overland tours which seem quite affordable and worthwile considering the cost of renting a car or booking Safaris on your own. On the other hand I am more of an independent traveller and worry that their tight itinerary would stress me out and prevent me from hanging out with locals I meet and doing fun little detours.

Places you have visited and would not return?,"For me it is Cambodia, beautiful country but I had the worst time. The outright prostitution in Phnom Penh made me feel uncomfortable in ways I've never felt in Thailand. The girls looked so much younger, poorer and vulnerable than any of the girls I've seen in Thailand. 

I'm a woman in my 20s so was made to feel extremely unsafe by the men from europe, Russia, north America who were mostly overweight, balding and over 50. I had a feeling these were bad men who probably have come over for ease of access to sex with underage girls. They were criminals and made me feel sick and constantly scared. A few of them made comments towards me whilst I was alone, I could only understand the English ones but they were insulting. I feel so sorry for these poor Cambodian girls. 

I also travelled to Sihanoukville which was a dump, I only stayed a night as a jumping off place for the islands but that was more than enough. Same dodgy atmosphere men with underage Cambodian girls. Apparently this was a lovely beach town a few years back but nothing of the sort now. Litter everywhere, rabid dogs, shady characters, constant building, disgusting water. Had a quick walk then straight back to the hotel before I got mugged. 

The islands werent bad, had a much better time on Koh Rong and Koh Toch than I did on the mainland but imho there are beautiful islands all over SEA so I wouldnt see a reason to visit them again. 

Lastly Siem Reap, again dodgy characters, less so and more travellers but still the feeling of uncomfortable every time I see a white man with a tiny cambodian girl. Angkor wat was incredible, watching the sunrise over the temples was surreal and probably the highlight of my trip. However I've seen it now and dont think I'd need to see it again.

Solo travel has really become Solo travel,"I wanted to travel the world growing up, like most kids do to some extent. 5 years ago, when I first got the chance to start doing that regularly, I had no idea how to travel and meet people while traveling. That didn't stop me from booking solo trips to anywhere my passport would allow whenever I got Skiplagged notifications about flight price-drops. I'd visit places where I didn't speak the language, stay at budget hotels without any other travelers and especially travelers my age. I'd walk around foreign cities in places like Panama and Japan, knocking out places marked on google maps. I would go days without having real face-to-face conversations aside from the occasional google-translate assisted conversations with Uber drivers. These were exciting times because I was visiting places that I had only read about in history books and I was literally living my dreams. But being a very social person who thrives off meeting people and making new friends, it was also always a bit weird. Entire short trips felt like meditative experiences as I had a lot of time to spend with myself and my thoughts. I think they helped me grow tremendously as a person. Eventually, I found out about hostels/pub-crawls/free-walking tours/CS events and how easy it is to make friends with fellow travelers through any of those. And I never looked back. Traveling and backpacking became very social endeavors. Meeting people at the hostels and going out for a drink every night with fellow backpackers became a daily part of traveling. I am that guy that literally goes out every night when traveling, even if I cannot drink more than a beer because I have to wake up for a 6 am day-trip. In some ways I didn't grow as much from these trips, but this was just more fun and I had no intention of going back to the solo ways.

Now, the Pandemic has brought things back to how they used to be. I just came back from a 2 week trip through all the major Hawaiian islands, and this felt a lot like my first few trips to Central America. Sometimes I was the only guest at the hostel. I was driving around all day around the islands, almost always alone. It was surreal going to popular hikes and State National Parks and often being literally the only one there except for park rangers. At the same time it got lonely. Some days I would come back around sunset knowing I wouldn't meet another person till I visit a coffee shop the next morning. Just like the first trips, I had a lot of time to spend with my thoughts. I probably had more moments of deep reflection in the 5 days in Maui than I did in the 4 weeks in Stockholm last year. At the same time, I don't think I did anything as fun/euphoric as meeting a group of awesome French guys at a techno party in Zagreb and heading with them to Slovenia the next day. I guess ideally I would have a bit of both during my travels. I feel like I can't complain because traveling (even like this) is the most fun thing I can think of doing right now. I will absolutely keep doing it to the extent it's safe until this pandemic ends. It's still a great time. But I also have to say I can't wait for things to get back to how they used to be with packed hostels and late nights. Felt like these thoughts belong here and others may relate

EDIT: To anyone concerned about me not following Hawaii's quarantine restrictions for visitors, I live in Oahu. Inter-island travel was allowed and considered safe during my trip. State National parks have been open to the extent they can be while enforcing social distancing measures (all indoor buildings, visitor centers and certain hikes have remained closed). Even the cars I drove were picked up via non-contact methods with Turo where the keys were left in disinfected lock-boxes attached with the window.  If you can't tell from the title or the entire post, my interaction level with other humans on this trip was on par with that of Tom Hanks's in Cast Away",solotravel,mclovin215

Hi! Can someone tell me how the restrictions will be in April 2021? Also need help with daily budget. Thanks!,"/s

You can delete this, if this is isn't supposed to be here.

Lately, this has become really something nerve wrecking, people seem to assume this Sub can predict the future.

It became quite uncanny to scroll through new posts, basically only consisting of oracle-like questions and impossible help seeking.

I think it has affected this sub. I see less engaging overall and some of the better posts just disappear in the sheer amount of above said posts.

Furthermore, it is understandable to need help with budgetting or asking what it's like somewhere else. I mean, i guess that's what the sub is for.

Funnily enough, it seemed to become really common to avoid some info gathering before, google-ing and maybe even select a few countries to be more specific.

A world trip to maybe 6 different nations on 15 continents in Octember 2026 making a stop at the Moon station via Musk-Tours seems more specific, that some of the questions this sub is getting.

Is It Expensive Traveling With A Flexible Itinerary?,"I'm planning my first solo trip, hopefully, and optimistically sometime this summer, and I want this trip to be as open-ended and flexible as possible.  I've really taken to the concept of traveling with no concrete dates, in sort of a nomadic fashion, just staying in a city or country until I get bored and deciding a week or less out where I want to go next and when.  I've seen many posts here and follow many travel vlogers who travel like this and I've been inspired.

However, it seems to me that this style of travel would be much more expensive, particularly when booking flights on such short notice.  Am I wrong?  Is there a good strategy to save money on flights when traveling in this style?

To add more specifics, I'm planning on traveling to Turkey, and then from there, I would like to continue on to at least one or two more countries nearby in the Middle East or the Mediterranean.

Weak passport holders- how do you travel spontaneously?,"So I plan to travel once it is safe to travel. My idea initially was to take a break from my job and travel for 3 months backpacking across Europe. But seems like that plan will take a while due to the pandemic.

I love on the spot plans and just hate booking  hotels in advance as sometimes I want to stay longer and sometimes I want to move fast.

Central America: Where is the Turf to Surf?,"Hello all,

I have been brainstorming travel ideas as life begins to slowly crawl towards normalcy again, and have been dying to go on a trip. I have just received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine (am an HCW) and am receiving my next dose in two weeks if it is worth mentioning. 

If possible, I'd like to plan this trip for early to mid May. My budget is ideally under $1500 for two weeks in a country in Central America. I also have $150 cashback bonus on my credit card that I plan on putting toward the cost of the flight. I am kind of a history geek as well, but am also interested in somewhere rich in hiking spots, with other activities available (allowing social distancing of course). I Imagine costs for the flight will amount to no more than $350 out of the total 1500. I have found several beachside AirBnbs in Nicaragua around $25 per night!

As for activities, the main thing on my list is finding the best beaches to surf on. I'm open to hiking, fishing, camping, swimming and the like. I live in the deep midwest, and have been a wage slave at my place of work since COVID - am needing to get away from that place for a bit. The language barrier doesn't mean much, I have a decent amount of traveling experience and know enough Spanish to get by. 

In what country can I get the most out of my money?Does 1500 seem like enough for a trip such as this? As the vaccines become distributed, will countries begin to adjust their policy regarding international travelers? 

I have been considering Nicaragua and Costa Rica the most. I've consulted some friends who have traveled Central America and I was told that Nicaragua is too dangerous and Costa Rica is too expensive. What do y'all think?

5 Things That have made Solo Travel more Enjoyable to Me after 30+ Countries - Looking for Other Viewpoints from Travellers,"1)	A phone with battery to last 2 days and MAPS.ME offline maps application. During my early solo travels, getting lost was always something that I was afraid of. Maybe I was hesitant on exploring a neighbourhood because I suspected I wouldn’t find my way back. Maybe I was hesitant to follow a road because it could turn out to be a waste of time. No more of that after I discovered that offline maps can minimise all these issues. You always know where you are and even if you get lost, you can easily find your way back. This made me feel much freer and more increased my eagerness to explore different places in a city.

2)	A good selection of eBooks pre-selected before the trip. Any trip has downtime, maybe a long queue, recovering from a heavy meal at a restaurant or just these few hours at the end of the day to relax. I find that it’s good for the mind to keep busy reading something during those hours. It could be a book related to the place of visit or about the history of the country. It could also be something completely unrelated like a Victorian novel or a non-fiction book about a subject of your interest. It doesn’t matter as long as it compels you to read and keeps your mind busy.

3)	Packing light and a good backpack. When I first arrive in a new location, I don’t want to feel the stress of having to find my accommodation right away because of heavy luggage concerns. For that reason I pack as light as possible with the assumption I must be able to carry the weight throughout the days on my back at all times. It makes my travels a lot more free-spirited. I can wander around the city all day and only go to the hostel/hotel late at night and then leave again early in the morning to maximise sightseeing time.

4)	Leaving flexibility in my plans and being okay with missing MUST-SEE places if they don’t personally interest me. This has greatly freed up my travelling days. My previous approach included listing down let’s say 5 places that the guidebook recommended and then visiting them, this left me feeling like I am doing hard work and sometimes the places themselves felt overrated or not worth seeing. My new approach to mitigate this is to just decide for myself what I want to see – Lonely Planet says a museum on local religious art is number one attraction – great, but I don’t care much for religious art so I will rather spend my 2 hours walking around a neighbourhood and taking photos and trying out local food.

5)	(Advanced-Only) Going in blind without doing any research and not booking any accommodation ahead of time. After being to 30+ countries, travel can start to feel routine. You go to city x, sightsee, sleep at hotel x, then go to city y, sightsee, sleep at hotel y. It’s all a bit predictable. I wanted to feel a sense of chaos and adventure, so I tried out this philosophy on a recent trip to Morocco. I did very little research, the only accommodation I booked was the first night after landing. Then when in Morocco, if I felt like staying an extra day, I could do so, if transport options to go to place x were not available, I simply went to place y, it made the entire trip much more relaxed and spontaneous. There were also more moments of surprise as I had done little research so it felt like exploring the unknown sometimes. The only thing to note here is that this approach can only be done in countries with lower tourist demand (such as South Morocco in early December) as otherwise the price penalty from not booking ahead would be significant.",solotravel,rw1337

Making an informed decision about travel at this time,"Travel and tourism are contentious topics right now. For good reason. I see a lot of people on the fence about their planned travels.

--------------------------------------------------------

**Tourism-reliant places desperately need my money**

This is an unfortunate reality. But it's worth asking yourself one thing. Is this really why you're going on a vacation? If it were your largest motivator, why would a donation not suffice? My favorite clubs are suffering right now too. And yet, it would not make sense for me to go clubbing. Nor would it be a charitable act.

**I am following all the rules**

I think we all agree that just because you can doesn't really mean you should. In many parts of the US, local regulations say you're able to go around without a mask. We know unequivocally that this is wrong. Despite it being allowed within the rules it puts everyone around you in harm's way.

**I'm taking all the necessary safety precautions**

For one, as we all know, a negative result is not a guarantee that you are COVID-free. This puts your flight attendants, pilots, airport/airline staff, taxi drivers, hospitality staff all at needless risk.

Two, the biggest safety precaution that our public health experts have advocated has been ""stay home"". You cannot be abiding by all the recommended safety precautions given that you've violated the biggest one.

**I will be fine even if I get sick**

I'm trying to foster an honest discussion. So honestly, chances are, yes. People on reddit tend to be younger and you'll likely make it out OK. But as people who love to travel, I have to imagine part of the reason why is because you genuinely love the different people and cultures of the world.

Show your compassion and love for these people now with your patience. They are excited for you to come back as much as you are to see them. But there is a time and place. And while it is not now, it will come soon.

--------------------------------------------------------

I know this has been a tremendously difficult experience. But normalcy is so close. A vaccine is within grasp and you will have it soon. Better yet, a vaccine will make your travel experiences exponentially better. And of course, the people and places you love around the world will be much safer too.

I know people can't stay inside their home indefinitely. You need to leave the house once in a while, if just for your sanity. Try local day trips that have minimal exposure to others. I've hiked this year more than I ever have in my life!

And at risk of sounding privileged, consider what a gift time can be. I have never had so much free time in my life before. I've started reading again. I've started playing my cello again after a decade away. I'm taking courses in statistics (for my career) and Spanish (for my future travels). My diet and exercise have never been better! While these luxuries are not something everyone obviously has access to, I imagine if you are considering travel/vacations right now these might be accessible to you too.

Ultimately, I'm a stranger on the Internet and the decision is yours alone. But I think it's important to be honest with oneself about your motivations before making a decision. I hope I've helped in some way to inform an honest assessment when you make your choice.",solotravel,blue_doki

Use up all my hotel points and still meet people for my birthday trip to Central Europe?,"I've done plenty of solo traveling in the past, stayed at hostels, hotels, airbnb's, flown first class and taken obscure local trains. I also have really been into gathering hotel and airline points from credit cards the last 5 years, and using them mostly to fly better airline classes when the flight is over 8 hours long. I've only occasionally used hotel points, preferring to do bnbs and hostels when traveling solo to save money and meet people more.

But my 30th birthday is coming up this summer, so I booked a trip to Central Europe (Budapest, Vienna, and Prague), and I want to treat myself for this one. 
I have tons of points I could use for swanky hotels in these cities, but I feel I would miss out on meeting people, and end up feeling very alone during the trip. On the other hand, if I have the hotel points why not use them before they get devalued into oblivion and save the money for other stuff?

What do I do about this messy situation?,"Hey there,

So I'm sure I'll get shit on more than anything for this because of COVID so I'll preface that I:

* Am vaccinated
* Will wear a mask and face shield and use hand sanitizer 1,000 times
* Will be getting tested multiple times, and will not be ""doing tourist shit"" or interacting with the locals and will quarantine when I get there and when I get back.

**So my question is:**

I have a flight scheduled for January 23rd from Newark to Morocco (actually it's Alaska to Newark to Morocco but they are two separate bookings). My flights from NY&gt;MA and back were wicked cheap, about half the price of the next cheapest flight which should have been my first red flag. I booked with TAP Portugal and didn't really think anything of it.

Well, I mention my flight to someone on Facebook and they say ""oh no, TAP is horrible"". They had apparently canceled her flights **three times**(!) and refuse to issue a refund. Like basically it's a known scam airline that sells crazy cheap flights and then cancels 90% of them last-minute, never issuing any refunds. I looked online and saw dozens and dozens and dozens of extremely angry reviews.

So I called TAP Portugal customer service and... the number doesn't work. Like, the airline's number just doesn't work. I try several other numbers associated with the airline, none of them work. Expedia, which I used to buy the ticket, basically washed their hands of it. ""We can't call them if you can't"" kinda deal. Plus the airline set the cancellation fee at **$400-fucking-dollars**.

So I contact my bank to see if they can chargeback. They can't, because despite the ticket being purchased a week ago it still hasn't posted and they can't touch a charge until it's posted.

**So I'm wondering:**

* Does anyone have experience with international flights with TAP Portugal?
* Should I just go with the hopes that the flight will actually run, and run the risk of having it canceled last minute and being stranded in NYC?
* Buy another fucking ticket and eat the cost of the budget ticket, with the off-chance possibility that they might refund me?

Travel plans for France // Greater western EU trip: Looking for suggestions to and tips to get me started as a first time traveller,"I know this post is perhaps a bit more vague than the other ones here, but I don't have any precise plans for travel quite yet, just that I know after all this pandemic nonsense is said and done I *need* to get out of the country. I was specifically reserving 2020 for my ""fuck it, I'm going to travel the world"" year, and my new company gives me a month of vacation. So, might as well start planning now.

I know French and some German, and France has always been a destination I'd love to tour, but I need suggestions for good cities and sites to visit because it has just been difficult to wade through all the tourist-adevertisement laden stuff, I don't actually have that much interest in Paris, but would love to see and tour some of the lesser known chateaus and countryside towns. If you guys know of any particularly pretty hidden gems. If I have the time and money, I might do a bit of backpacking/touring more of France and western Europe in general, specifically I'd love to visit Berlin and Lisbon, I also have friends from my time volunteering scattered around Europe (London, Rome, Geneva, Solo). So, if there are generally any ""must sees"" or ""If you're going to visit X region, here's everything I would look into"". That'd be awesome!

Again, I know this is kinda vague and a lot, but as a first timer I'm not looking for an encyclopedia or everything to be spoon fed. Just some ""Hey, if you like X, these regions have nice stuff"". Because trying to get the big-picture stuff sifted from all the tourism-laden websites is... Difficult, and I'd like recommendations from other travelers :)",solotravel,Cendruex
"Will Covid-19 or the issue of ""over-tourism"" make you to rethink your plans?","Before Covid hit there were countless articles about over-tourism (too many tourists) in places like Paris, Rome, Prague, Barcelona, Venice, etc. Then Covid-19 hit and they went deserted. Have any of you changed your plans (or thought about changing your plans) to avoid contributing to the  problem in the future or maybe avoid crowds where you could more easily get an air-borne disease as crowds are returning? Does anyone live in a city/region that gets too many tourists?

My own city Sofia was becoming way too touristy in 2019 and many here have complained of it losing its authenticity. I quote a friend ""Hearing foreign speech is cool during the first 100 times, after that it makes you feel like the place has been infiltrated and hijacked"" (must be a subconscious thing from prehistoric tribalism lol). Most places where people have been friendly to me are either those where there aren't that many tourists/foreigners (genuine curiosity and interest) OR those that literally rely on tourist money to survive (not very genuine). Locals in cities that are big enough to survive even without foreign tourism are usually less accommodating/welcoming and couldn't care less. Anyone notice this pattern?

The pandemic showed that tourism is a very volatile sector and societies who rely only on it need to diversify. As for me, I've decided to travel to less popular parts of countries (Southeastern/Eastern Poland, Eastern Hungary, Puglia in Italy) and only stick to a few popular touristy places where I really love the place &amp; local culture, but visit them less often (Madeira, Krakow, Stockholm, etc.). And you?

Edit: 2nd and 3rd tier places in Europe worth checking imo: Bamberg, Erfurt, Eisenach/Wartburg, Visby/Gotland, Przemysl, Tarnow, Morskie Oko, Debrecen, Balaton lake, Ruse, Sliven, Yambol, Stara Zagora, Bari and Lecce.",solotravel,martinotbulgaria
"for my WOMEN solo travelers, what are some feminine hygiene rules &amp; tips other women should know?","ive been reading about the differences of feminine hygiene products in other countries, in the USA there are applicator tampons and a LOT of options! but in countries like germany they don’t use applicator tampons &amp; south korea they have more expensive &amp; limited amount of deodorant because they don’t smell BO wise (im korean and that’s mostly true, still use deodorant/antiperspirant though). i also have another question if you made it up to here, are there ultra sized tampons in your country? during my period i use a menstrual cup for sleep (they last 12 hours) &amp; ultra sized tampons for the day (the ONLY size that doesn’t require a pad underneath &amp; prevents leakage!) i literally would not survive without them ultra sized tampons, so lmk if they’re available in your country!",solotravel,le0naanais
Is there a list of hostels that have permanently closed this year?,"I've seen a little discussion about this on r/solotravel but not as much as I expected to. I’m curious about which hostels have closed permanently due to this year’s lack of travel (and how many have closed in general). I know there are a few threads about certain hostels that have closed, but I’m wondering if it would be possible to make a mega-list of hostels that have closed permanently so that people who have spent time there have a place online to pour one out for the places that meant something to them, or to just know that a place they used to love (or hate) has closed up shop. 

These are the ones I know of off the top of my head that have closed permanently. I can keep the list updated if the mods are cool with it:

\- Retox (Budapest) 

\- HI Hostel (Austin, TX, USA)

&amp;#x200B;

I think the aspect of solo travel I miss the most is staying at the kind of hostel that feels more like home than your actual home – the kind of place that you get stuck at for way too long because you can't bear to check out. I've been donating a bit on [AdoptAHostel](https://www.adoptahostel.com/), but I know that there are a lot of beloved hostels that aren't on there, and I'm not sure how much it helps in the face of such huge hostel income losses. Anyways, let me know if anyone has other confirmations about places that have closed permanently. I'll add them to the list above.",solotravel,akbanx
Difference in behavior traveling solo vs a group,"Since I haven't been able to travel much I was thinking about past trips, looking through old photos, etc.  I noticed that the trips where I traveled  solo I act completely different.  My experiences ended up being completely different even in places that were the same. It was consistent during domestic (US) and overseas trips. 

In groups I'm shy, I never meet any locals, I only spend time with friends, I don't do much site seeing.  It's generally just my girls and I hanging out in a different location.  I don't feel like I get much of a 'trip' out of it but I come back fresh and relaxed abd still look back on those trips as fulfilling.  

Solo I'm almost extroverted, I meet a ton of locals, go site seeing, do excursions, stay in dumpy hostels/airbnb's, turn on a Tinder account that just says ""Here on vacation"", go out more.  I generally look back on these trips as fulfilling as well and definitely more of an adventure, however I come back exhausted and almost needing a couple days to just chill.  

Both are great and I think I would want to continue both but it took a long break from travel to notice the differences.",solotravel,Street_archer_87
Transiting overnight through London on way to US. Can I go to hotel?,"So I'm flying from Finland to the US, transiting through LHR. 

Travel restrictions have messed everything up and I have an overnight layover (5PM to 10AM, so under 24h) in London.

Option 1: Suck it up, stay airside
Option 2: Pass customs, go to hotel, sleep.

No embassy website has super clear instructions for this scenario. Only that I may be required to take a Covid test if I pass customs (OK with me). 

But my Q is, does passing through customs in the UK in the first place affect my entry into US?

Thanks for help, am lost.",solotravel,arthuurian
What can I expect being brown in Bulgaria and Romania?,"I'm going to be traveling to Turkey later this year and am thinking of visiting Sofya and Bucharest too. I'm Pakistani and visibly so. I don't think this will be a huge issue, but I want to know what level of racism I can expect just to prepare myself. Anyone have any insight?",solotravel,raphay
Sad that I won't be able to travel again," I have a feeling the COVID-19 pandemic will last at least two years just like the Spanish Flu (1918-1920), I'm guessing mid 2022. In January 2020, I booked a cheap roundtrip airline ticket from New York, New York to Miami, Florida for the end of March 2020. Then COVID-19 forced me to cancelled my ticket two days before departure. I was really looking forward to my trip. If I knew this was going to happen, I would've never bought a ticket in the first place. I'm kind of worried I won't be able to use my airline credit at all since the ticket was nonrefundable and it expires in December 2021, hopefully the airline will extend it. I would've continued my trip to Florida, but beaches and restaurants were closed at 5pm, city curfew at 10pm and Disney World was closed indefinitely, so there was no point of me going with all those restrictions. I have this feeling that I have to wait five years to start traveling again meaning no mask, no social distancing and no quarantine. I'm sick and tired of staying home all the time, not going anywhere at all while extremely bored. I rather be staring out of an airplane window, instead of my living room window looking at trees. This pandemic is making me waste my 20s away, the age range I'm suppose to enjoy (I turned 24 two days ago). Every time I look at the photos/videos of my first solo trip in May 2019 at the age of 22, I start to smile, wishing I can go back to 2019. Don't take life for granted as they say. I miss traveling so much! How's everybody doing in this pandemic? Were you forced to cancel your trip? Happy New Year! #2021",solotravel,Positive-Aide680
Atlas Obscura trips - any experience?,"While travel still seems like a bit of a pipe dream at the moment, I'm considering signing up for a group trip when it looks more realistic. I'm considering the standards (Contiki, TopDeck, G Adventures), but saw on an old Reddit post that Atlas Obscura actually [hosts group travel](https://www.atlasobscura.com/unusual-trips/all#2021%20trips).

Has anyone ever been on one of these trips? I'm intrigued by their offerings, especially the [space-themed Russia trip](https://atlasobscura.com/unusual-trips/moscow-soviet-space), which seems incredible (I'm really interested in space travel).

Disclaimer (based on other threads I've read where people have asked about organised group travel): I'm aware that these are expensive and it would be cheaper to organise myself; I'm very comfortable organising my own trips, just keen to give some group travel a go later in the year and these seem like very unique trips.",solotravel,eclipse--mints
"Anyone like traveling to places on the basis of ""who else do you know has gone to x""?","Something was pointed out to me by my family over the holidays(via Zoom). My travel plans have shifted in the year before the pandemic to look for stuff that aren't ""regular"" destinations in earnest.

 I have visited my share of more ""popular"" destinations (Paris, London etc.) and certainly enjoy them. I am not a person who degrades anyone for their choice of travel. I have a great aunt who spoke with me about wanting to go to Rome on her first international trip and said ""but that's just too boring for you"" and I reassured her that any place she wants to go is a good trip for her.

 I mention this because I was told that I have begun to look at places on the basis of the question ""do you know anyone who has traveled to x"" or ""who else do you know has gone to x.""  I was told that I am doing this just to shock people and gain credibility with other travelers as well as one-upping others. I had never thought of it like that, but I had mentioned that I would really like to see Iran and Saudi Arabia. These are two places that have intrigued me since I was young, but as a solo woman traveler, I never thought I'd get the chance. I have read more and more about them and it looks like they are potential options, but I have been told that I would only be doing it because it is uncommon(though probably not on this sub).

I was thinking about it and I guess that is part of the appeal of some places. I'd like to visit the Faroe Island and Svalbard. I'd love to do the Trans Siberian railway and Beijing to Lhasa one as well. These are all places that look cool but am I doing it just because it is less common? My family and friends do not believe that these are places that are actually on anyone's bucket list. They intrigued me for what they are but I can't deny that there is a part of me that thinks ""I will be going somewhere that no one I know would venture to."" It feels adventurous. I was the first person in my family to visit Japan(my first solo trip) and everyone had a meltdown(except my deceased father who accurately predicted that it would be the first of many journeys), and now, as much as I love Japan, it feels a little pedestrian. I'd love to go back, but to explore the more out of the way places.

Sorry, this was long and rabmly, but I am just thrown off a bit, feeling like perhaps my motives for travel are wrong?",solotravel,dezayek
How do you decide to drive or fly?,"I had some flight vouchers which were only good for travel within the US.  I decided to book a flight to DC, rent a car and explore various battlefields from the Civil War and revolution.  Now that I'm shopping for rental cars, I realize I've made a terrible mistake.  The flight may be free, but the rental car + parking at my hometown airport will add up to almost $1000!   I think I will end up cancelling the flight and driving down.  If you are going alone, where do you draw the line on driving vs. flying?",solotravel,Excellent-Emu-5710
Travelling in Covid as a SOLO teenage (19M) traveller: Poland – Slovakia - Hungary; August/September 2020,"We can all agree since the lockdown, life has taken an interesting route. Personally, my adventure to Switzerland were cancelled and a holiday to Berlin was put on hold. priorities began to focus on other areas of life and no longer being in and out the airports.

My last solo trip was back in January to Portugal, so I was ready for a trip. fortunately, I booked a cheap flight to Palermo and spent 3 nights there to fuel the spark and getting into the zone. March to July (4months) slowly passed and now its time to travel!

Finally made it to my hostel **Bubble Hostel (£5 a night)** after a budget friendly flight to the airport located 15k outside of the centre. When you first step foot outside any airport, the taxis are the first line of defence, but you got to ignore them and find a bus/metro or a train– in Krakow’s case, a bus was the option. Travelling solo allows you to listen to music so always have the freshest Spotify playlist prepared you’re your adventure.

Arriving from the UK were BoJo was doing his best impersonation of Vicky Pollard (Picture Daily mirror of this). You would expect the clubs and bar crawl to be closed... You are wrong! Whilst I was in Poland, I went on the same bar crawl 5 times! All nightclubs open until 5am and later. It seems to me that Covid must go to sleep at midnight.  Forget the new normal because I am now back in the normal. 1m floor signs and masks still to be worn in indoor spaces, Gyms fully open and no need to book. This was a blessing as gyms only reopened later on in the UK...and of course closed again

During my month in ‘Eastern’ Europe you allocentrics may call it - to me its Central Europe. It seemed very calm and controlled compared to the state in the UK. It continued like this for the whole month.

The flight situation was the there was no blocking of seats, however on all three flights I experienced, there was the luxury of a row to myself. The bus situation is that there are no blocking of seats and it seemed normal. The only thing what was different is that you have to wear a masks in both areas

Headphones in and listening to the varies songs and occasionally podcast – I ventured on the explore the main attractions of Krakow (Pictures). There are positives travelling in Covid, as the sites become quieter and as a tourist, it is an opportunity to appreciate the sites. On the other hand, less people on the bar crawls, but the locals did not disappoint.

When visiting a new country, it is always best to learn a few words to impress the locals whenever you’re in a bar and had too much to drink. I experienced many friendly people and never felt unsafe in Poland as everyone I met was very welcoming. In my first hostel, I met a few German lads who I had a chat to about the city they were from and my limited knowledge on to Bundesliga. Travelling around, I feel like football is a universal language (Especially being from Manchester) as people smile when you just mention a few players from their country or team.

3 days into Krakow, I reluctantly switched hostels to **Willa Retro Hostel (£9 a night)** as I enjoyed the free coffee/tea and breakfast offered by the Bubble Hostel. In the new hostels garden was a very chilled vibe with music and socializing taking place.A complete opposite to what lockdown offered in the months of April and May. At this point, my excitement levels jumped despite I had no plans on the coming month.

A few days later, I agreed on an itinerary exploring the southern areas of Poland. This include the cities of Katowice – Wroclaw – Lodz – Warsaw – Lublin – Zakopane (via Krakow). Spontaneously after a chat to a stranger at 4am in a Krakow nightclub I decided to go to Budapest BUT turns out I had to go before the 1st September as Hungary were closing their borders. I did not know this prior purchasing the Flixbus tickets from Krakow – Kosice (Slovakia) then Kosice – Budapest.

Sad to be leaving Krakow I ventured on to Katowice just for the night. I can’t say much about this city but around this time there were protest against the current government on their views on gay rights so I spectated a fairly peaceful protest in the city centre. **Hostel Sentral (£9 a night)** was seen as a bargain as I was one of two people in my dorm - another common theme

Few hours on the morning bus ride to Wroclaw was relaxing as there was no people around me. This was a regular theme throughout my trip. Travelling in Covid was a dream for exploring. Wroclaw was a lovely surprise due to it reminding me what Krakow was like with the beautiful architecture. Labelled as a university city, I did notice the student scene as the parks on the river were full of life with people drinking and just socializing. This was a completely different approach to the UK due to no more than 6 people meeting up. Still amazed that the gyms still open and the evening atmosphere in the centre still alive. You wouldn’t see a soul enjoying life in the major cities of the UK. I didn’t stay much in **Absynt Hostel (£6 a night)** as there were many areas to check out. (Pictures of stadium, centre and park) It had that big city feel which I wernt expecting but I can see this city picking up a reputation and I would recommend anyone to visit

On to the lesser known cities of Poland – Lodz. Another cheap and safe journey by Flixbus and I was greeted by the presence of nothing. A massive bus station filled with nothing. I don’t know if this is because of Covid or the bus station is too big for the city?

The same greeting, I had from the bus station was the same greeting I had when I entered my dorm at the **Cynamon Hostel (£8 a night)** Nothing. No one entered my room for the next 3 nights I was there, and I’m convinced there was no one else in the entire hostel. An entire hostel for £24 pounds for 3 nights. Royalty. Lodz isn’t too popular with tourist, but I’m surprised to see no domestic tourists. It was the weekend, so it gave me an opportunity to check out the nightlife. Over this weekend I watched the demolition Bayern Munich did to Barcelona.. watched on Bein sport with some guys from the Middle East. No English spoken it seems in these parts of Poland and so just ordering a simple drink was complicated. I laughed with the locals, whilst not understanding a word but the music was good!

Warsaw... second time in Warsaw for me after visiting with friends back in March 2019. One of my favourite buildings is located in this city (Palace of Cultural &amp; Science) but apart from that..eurgh. When travelling, I think when you travel to the capital, it does not represent the country, so travelling to the second cities to countries it gives a fairer review of a country. One of the many few positives Warsaw holds is that there’s an impressive beach where you can chill! **City View Lucka Hostel (£5 a night).** Not the best hostel but I was bound to encounter a negative hostel experience especially when hopping from hostel to hostel. Moving on..

Travelling again with Flixbus to the next city on the eastern side of Poland which is Lublin. Prior to coming to this surprisingly close-knit town, I didn’t do any research as I wanted to be surprised.. and I was! A standard old town filled with the coloured buildings and hosting an impressive castle casting over the town. I would recommend this place and recommend the hostel as well **Folk Hostel (£8 a night).** Finally I weren’t alone in a dorm, as I got talking to a few of the tourist. Just by luck a Hungarian girl was staying in the dorm as I ended up getting her contacts as I planned to visit Budapest. Also, a hostel first for me was that a dog was staying in the room, was a very cute dog and caused no problem aww. The main attraction in this town is the Concentration Camp located on the outskirts of the city. Vast area with a handful of people in the grounds. Highly recommended if your interested in the history of the surroundings.

Flixbus again of course back to where it all started. How much has Krakow changed with Covid restrictions since I was last there a few weeks ago? Turns out, not much as I met up with the bar crawl lads and seshed to 6am with varies nationalities including France, Netherlands and even the UK.  As a solo traveller it is a great way to meet people and connect with as when you’ve had a drink you would make friends with anybody. In and out of hostels It is always good to splash out (not too much) on an apartment for a few days to recharge the batteries. A dumb move by me was the book an apartment by the train station - **JM Rooms Lubicz 10 (£15 a night)** .. wonder why it was so cheap!

Afternoon bus to the hidden beauty of Zakopane. Only 3 hours from Krakow and I highly recommend visiting if you ever get the opportunity. I expect it to be packed because of the many walking routes you can do in summer, in contrast to the skiing in winter. I really did get that Austrian mountains vibe but with such cheap prices. One to visit again in the future, unreal views UNREAL. **Willa Mavi (£13 a night)** topped it for me as I decide to stay in apartment with views of the mountains. BONUS: it had a bathtub! When you visit the bordering regions of Poland/Slovakia, you got to check out the ‘Morskio Oko’. Even in these Covid times, get to the bus station early to beat the crowds because you would like the lake for yourself.

A completely different side of Poland I thought id never encounter with the fresh air and amazing views. I returned to Krakow feeling content knowing it was the weekend, so I had to go on a bar crawl on my last night of Krakow. I sure did that and stayed out until 6… No 10pm pubs shutting here but hey ho, you people in the UK had 50% off food.

Next day was off to a new place in a new country – Kosice, Slovakia. Was a lengthy bus journey and no trouble crossing the border. I thought because of Covid there would be trouble but no there was no problem whatsoever but could I leave Slovakia and enter Hungary... who knows lets risk it.

It’s a shame for Slovakia because it is positioned in between their well-known neighbours of Poland &amp; Hungary. I personally not too interested in the country and yes I have been to the capital - Bratislava last year (not solo).

My mind was just thinking about if I can enter Hungary, but I would have to take a overnight train to Ruzemberok then a bus down to Budapest. Thankfully, no issues on crossing the borders. The date was 31/08/2020 so one day just before the borders close. From the bus station to the hostel was just an easy metro ride to the centre. It really is not hard to direct your way around the major cities of Europe just follow the maps on offer and use google maps. The metro to the centre was a quick ride and I was soon ready to check in…but it was 7am. Most hostels/hostels accept check ins at 2pm so knowing this I booked the night before and with hope I could sleep the morning away in Budapest. Long story short that was not possible. After chatting to an Italian girl about her city Torino, who was working in the **Hostel One Basilica (£5 a night)** I explored the attractions such as the Parliament Building, Chain Bridge and many more.  The busiest attraction would be the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, but we are in a global pandemic.

The nightlife in Budapest did not disappoint despites it was Covid. Luckily my hostel was full of outgoing people who worked in the hostel and knew the best places to party. A tip for any student travelling is to research the citys Erasmus page and check if there are any events. This is because the beer tends to be cheaper!!! I was successful in my search for an Erasmus night. The entry was cheap, and the drinks were cheap but of course they were because Budapest is cheap!! So many people in these Covid times into a strange nightclub with many corridors to apply. Just a few hours ago I was talking to my mates how we miss a normal night out..oops. Further few nights were spent in the capital and I met up with the same girl from Lublin. She showed me around the city, and we talk about many different topics.

Thankfully I could escape Hungary as i could catch my flight to Zakynthos in Greece where my solo adventure would end. Party time!

Do you collect anything uniquely meaningful to you when you travel?,"I have a shoebox full of mementos from the time I lived in Europe - city maps, wristbands, concert tickets, restaurant menus, drink coasters, notes from friends, newspaper clippings, you name it. 

I was a *very* broke university student, so I couldn’t afford many meaningful souvenirs. I had to skip out on a lot of paid museums and restaurants for the same reason. Almost all of my money went toward Flixbus or budget Ryanair flights, spontaneous hostel reservations, and quick stops at grocery stores for beer and whatever cheap groceries I found affordable enough to hold me over for my time there (usually bread, a protein, and my fair share of greasy street food).

I may not have gotten the most in-depth cultural experience in each country, but it was a uniquely humble method of diving in and adapting to each new place. I’m not from a wealthy family whatsoever, so the worldly thinking I developed was life changing. The memories I made were well worth the struggles. I keep telling myself I’ll go back to some of my favorites someday - I think now I can afford a few €15 meals :) 

I’m doing better for myself now, much less vagabond but trying to keep up my share of unique travels. Feeling deprived (thanks COVID), I pulled my box from the back of a shelf for the first time in about 3 years and was understandably hit with a massive wave of nostalgia. Sure, it’s just a box of scraps, but to me it’s tangible proof that this weird, recurring dream I hold so dearly in the back of my mind was once reality. It’s a tiny reminder of the sweet, sweet freedom I once felt as a student, holding these same maps in these same hands as I happily navigated myself through new worlds with pure, bare-boned happiness. I realized I’ll never be able to share these feelings and bits of memories with anyone but myself but that’s what makes the old shoebox so beautiful.

I did it! I quit my job and am going travelling in the midst of craziness.,"Hey, I'm just about to make my dreams come true. I know, I have heard it all, and I even asked for Sabbatical leave at work, but was denied.

"Anyone have experience driving from the US to Monterrey, Mexico?","I have a three-month furlough coming up this summer and I'd like to to something fun. Last time I had a furlough, I went to Peru for a month. This time I'm thinking of an extended stay in Mexico, specifically Monterrey. I live in New Mexico, and would cross with my own car, as I would like to bring my two dogs with me. I'm interested in probably renting an AirBnB for a month or so and just exploring that city/area and improving my Spanish. I'm a solo woman traveler and I'm already fluent in Spanish. I've been to Mexico a number of times including studying in Mazatlan and a two week solo trip to Oaxaca and Puebla in 2018. All the same, I've never drove my own vehicle in a foreign country. Is the road from Laredo to Monterey safe? Is there anything I should know about driving in that part of Mexico? I live in New Mexico but specifically chose the Laredo route, as it would require the least solo driving in Mexico. I know I have to purchase insurance when I cross, but I don't know any specifics of that. I'm honestly also interested in getting all the way down to Mexico City and seeing Guanajato and San Luis Potosi on the way, but that seems quite overwhelming to me. Any thoughts on going that far south by car as well?

Hostel - cheapest option 

Hotel - most expensive option but more privacy and amenities

AirBnB - great local experience option


If you’re coming from a Western country, I noticed hotels are super cheap in Asia and Eastern Europe so you might as well book one of those. I found hotels for like $20 a night in Eastern Europe.

My work requires me to plan my vacations until mid January - but this year?,"I get thirty holidays and I've ""saved"" up five days worth of overtime from last year. Usually I do three weeks in April and three weeks in November. As things are going I won't be able to do a trip in April this time of course. Access to the vaccine is relatively unclear at this point, though it seems likely that here in Germany you will be able to get a vaccine as a healthy person in summer. To be safe I was thinking about putting in three weeks in late November/early December. But what to do with the rest? I'm afraid of planning - let's say three weeks in June and then losing out because of bad luck. That's why I'm then considering to spread it out a bit with shorter trips. Current plan looks like this: 

- July: 2 weeks in Spain (or somewhere else in Europe)

- September: 2 weeks in the US (or someplace else with a large amount of vaccinated people)

- December: 3 weeks in Mexico 

Do you think this is realistic or should I spread it out further with smaller trips? Problem is the more trips you take the more money you spend and only being at work for 3/4 weeks for half of the year sounds like it'd break up my workflow too much.",solotravel,No_Contact_3998

How much money would I realistically need to travel continuously for 3-6 months?,"I am a 21 year old located in Australia. Initially I was very career-driven but now I am starting to realise that COVID aside, I may never be in a better position to travel than I am now.

I am currently on a $63k salary with about $10k in savings. I would like to quit my job this/next year (depending on the COVID situation) and travel for a few months before getting another job. I am single and live pretty cheaply, so I envisage my savings increasing over the next few months.

I have an undergraduate law degree and about 4 years of work experience behind me, so i feel fairly confident that I wouldn’t be rendered unemployable by an extended travel period.

I realise that living costs vary but I am not fussy on travel locations - I just like to see new places. Would I be able to support myself on $20k in a foreign country, or do solo travellers pick up odd jobs along the way?

Australia Working Holiday!... or Not. Having Problems with Anxiety and Solo Travelling.,"Hi all. I’m hoping to go on a 417 Australian Working Holiday in January 2022 (assuming that boarders are open, and things are relatively back to ‘normal’) and so, looking for some advice. 

I’ve really dreamt of this trip for the last 2 - 3 years, researched and planned in depth, and used it as motivation to get to the end of uni (it would be a post-graduate travel gap year). At some points, it’s been all I could think about; the sun on my skin, seeing the Blue Mountains, taking a surf lesson, sailing the Whitsundays... However, now that it’s becoming ‘real’ and I’m getting closer to having to make actual decisions e.g applying for a visa and booking flights, I’m getting a bit nervous. I’m a fairly reserved and introverted person with, to be honest, a fair amount of general and social anxiety. I’ve lived by myself, a few hours from home, for the last year, and have traveled both locally and abroad many times before - with friends and family. Here, on holidays, I usually love every minute, largely the ‘doing’ element; the activities, the sights and experiences etc. but I’ve not travelled by myself before, let alone stayed in a hostel, and now, am questioning whether I can follow through with what I would love to do vs. what I’m capable of doing. A few family members, who I’m sure mean well, have basically told me not to go, due to my quietness and / or because of going by myself (I don’t know any friends or family who are either not in uni or work, or who are financially stable enough etc.), whilst my best friend encourages me to go for it.

So, any tips / experiences / suggestions for:
- Solo travelling for the first time (for females, in particular). 
- Anxiety and travelling. 
- Solo travelling / anxiety whilst on an Australian Working Holiday. 

(Please try to be constructive, not criticising.)

Happy New Year (and Decade!),"Hey folks! 

It’s been an interesting year to say the least haha - and I’m looking forward to being able to (solo) travel again :)

An interesting experience with solo travel - last year I traveled by myself to Quebec City for New Years (and I’ve done solo New Years another time in Montreal) and had a lot of fun with folks I met there!

Today as I’m wishing people a Happy New Year, besides my family, funny enough the group that we formed last year (also on WhatsApp) for New Years feels more like the group of people I’d love to spend another New Year’s Eve with!

There’s something quite fascinating about the relationships you make when you solo travel - neither of you expect much from the people long term - but for the time y’all are together, it does feel like a great community :)

Happy New Year y’all - and I’m optimistic about things getting better down the line :)

Travel Insurance,"Bit of a confession here, some of you will probably think its stupid of me but I havent really bought travel insurance for most of my trips, especially for the two 'multi countries' trips. Thankfully nothing happened to me for them, e.g. ended up in the hospital/lost some valuables etc.

Obviously, this is bad but has anyone else just go ahead and travel without them, and to those who gets travel insurance like normal people, which one do you suggest on getting (UK based if that helps). Reasons I dont get it is because, either I get really excited and forget about it or just see it as another expense I could get away without. But I know if shit hits then fan, it will cost me much more than getting one in the first place.

To those who have claimed, what happened and how does the process go, e.g. losing an item on a trip. I plan to take just one rucksack for my next trip in the near future hopefully and that would mean putting a camera along with my other things - maybe insurance would help just in case I end up losing/forgetting stuff while packing on the go.",solotravel,parttimebackpacker

Getting robbed and losing visa advice/experiences,"I’m trying to understand what people do in the case of getting robbed when moving between locations — ie where you haven’t been able to stow your passport and backup cash and card at a hotel/hostel.

I know you need to make your way to an embassy, but how do you do that with no money or identification?

Question(s) about WHV in Oz/ NZ,"I plan to apply for one of these in early 2022 so I can have a longer-term, sustained travel through Oceania without cutting too deep into my nest egg for further SEA/ steppe solo travel afterwards. 

I know that the visa is predicated on having short-term, non-career based jobs during the stint. My question is, besides seasonal/farmhand, what is actually allowed by this, and how is the legality determined? 

I have a few years of experience as a semi-nomadic engineer in mechanical, structural, and manufacturing environments. Would something like a term-limited contract job in this field be allowed? Either something like a graduate-level apprenticeship, lab/manu technician, or construction job in structures/hvac besides unskilled labor? I understand the availability of them is nigh-unpredictable, I’m more so curious if it’s even legally pursuable. 

Also, it seems like completion of a WHV has no impact on future long-term visa acceptance. Is this correct? I ask because I’m fairly certain to relocate from USA to either NZ or Germany permanently after 10-15 years of a semi nomadic living, and having completed my degree in Germany I have an advantage there. Would a year of life/work in NZ have no impact at all on future consideration?

Australian Visa,"I cant find a proper group for this question, but I need help!

While I was there I met my boyfriend and have since decided to move to Perth to go be with him. I know right now with covid we will be waiting for a bit and trust me I'm well aware of that whole situation. My question is this: Can I apply for the second Working holiday visa, or is there a time frame I missed? I heard that I may not be ablate enter for another 3 years? Or if there is an option to reapply for the first working holiday? When I go next I want to be there for a year and hopefully apply for a partner visa while I'm there, not yet though. I'm just confused as to what visa would work! I've looked everywhere. Thanks!

\*UPDATE\*

Just wanted to add some information after reading some comments. I'm currently 20 years old. I didn't do any of the needed work in order to qualify for a second working holiday. I arrived May 2019 and left August 2019, therefore my visa was good until around May 2020. So it has since then expired. My hope was being able to possibly reapply for the first one and then do the work, but I no longer think this is the case though it would be easier. I'm looking at partner visas but they're very expensive and take a while to process. I'm still waiting to see on if anything changes with their international travel ban, but if not I'm going to start applying for an exemption in February. ",solotravel,mrworldwidesupersize
Getting COVID in a foreign country while traveling,"Question for those still solo traveling during the pandemic.

Has anyone gotten COVID while in a foreign country? I don’t plan to travel until the vaccine, but I’m really curious how people are handling this.

Obviously it would be very unethical to move about  once you have symptoms, so what do you do? 

Cancel all forward (or return) travel until you clear a PCR 2-3 weeks later? Tell the hotel you are sick and can’t leave if you are supposed to check out?

If you are hostel bound, I wonder if they would just kick you out. Where do you go from there?! Seems inappropriate to check in to a new hotel or AirBnb once you are sick. 
And, depending on the country, how do you get food in a safe manner? It all seems quite risky, especially if you don’t speak the language.

"18 y/o, First Time Solo Travel to Latin America, Advice Needed","Hi guys,
Assuming coronavirus is sufficiently contained by 2021 summer*, I was hoping to go solo travelling. I am European and will have finished my final exams. Usually people after these exams go travelling with friends around Europe, however, I wanted to do something different. It's not that I have no friends to travel with, more that the last few years and my childhood in general have been difficult, and I feel like I am starting a new chapter in my life. As cheesy as it sounds, I am dying for some alone time somewhere foreign, where I can engage my love of travel and learning, as well as taking time for introspection and learning more about myself. I would aim to spend about one month or one month and a half travelling - much more than I could in Europe, given that Latin America is cheaper from what I understand.

Latin America has always fascinated me, which is why I really want to visit. Not only the culture, but also its history and its current interesting socio-economic situation, with countries like Mexico and Brazil straddling middle-income status, next to more developed nations like Chile and Uruguay. I am fairly fluent in Spanish (approx. C1 level), and am learning Portuguese.

I should mention right off the bat that I'm a city guy: I like buildings, I like museums, architecture, learning about the history and socio-economic and political situation of different places around the world. That said, I can and do appreciate nature when I get the chance; I'm just not the type to go hiking and trekking, more the type to sit and admire the scenery.
With that all said, I have a few questions:

What is the ideal itinerary? I had a few different ones in mind:
(-&gt; is by bus, =&gt; is by air)

Belo Horizonte -&gt; Sao Paulo -&gt; Curitiba -&gt; Iguazu Falls -&gt; Buenos Aires -&gt; Santiago =&gt; Lima &amp; Cusco OR Bogota

or

Buenos Aires =&gt; Ushuaia =&gt; Buenos Aires -&gt; Mendoza -&gt; Santiago =&gt; Lima, Cusco OR Bogota

or some combination of the two. 

Other cities of interest are Florianopolis, Porto Alegre and Asunción. Nothing is concrete yet, I'm really just playing around with ideas right now. From what I understand, many of the nature parks in South Brazil aren't accessible by public transport, which is why I haven't considered them.

2) As a first time (male) solo-traveler, is visiting Latin America - Brazil in particular - a good idea?
I am well aware that there are crime problems in Brazil. Although most of the dangerous cities appear to be in the North East, where I don't plan on going, I have still heard bad things about Sao Paulo, and even worse things about Rio, which is why I haven't even considered Rio for travel at all, and am cautious about considering Porto Alegre (please do tell me if this is silly or not). I have never had a gun pulled on me, or been the victim of violent crime; the only ""robbery"" I have experienced are street muggings by unarmed people when I was younger.

However, I should also mention that my family is of Indian origin; my family in India, who I regularly visit, live in a fairly poor/deprived part of Delhi, so I'm not unfamiliar with the discomforts of travelling in less developed regions. I have visited Chicago, Washington D.C., and the outskirts of Detroit, if that makes a difference.

I am also fortunate enough to be fairly well travelled with my family; we tend to do budget city breaks when we travel in Europe, which entails using lots of public transit, and sometimes staying in slightly shadier parts of town. Again, I am aware European ""danger"" is nothing relative to Brazil.

With all this mind, am I too ""inexperienced"" to go to Brazil (and/or Colombia)? What about Buenos Aires, Patagonia and Santiago?

Thanks for reading this far and for any help! And I'll repeat this is all very very speculative at the moment and something I am only just considering as a possibility, so if this is a crazy/dumb idea do say so!

*I am aware that this is very hopeful thinking, which is why I am not taking this plan overly seriously: I am not booking anything anytime soon. If it is not safe enough to travel in 2021 summer, I would still like to do this trip the following year, so any advice is still appreciated!",solotravel,adventurer8602

How to financially sustain yourself during long term traveling?,"I went on a date a few months ago with someone who had spent 3 years of his life just freely traveling the entire world. It's something I've always dreamed of doing and I want to get plans underway, but something I didn't get to ask him (and can't now because he ghosted me) was, how does one sustain themselves financially while traveling for 3 years? My best guess would be he must've picked up odd jobs along the way, but I don't even know how one goes about finding odd jobs to pick up. Do you just ask around? How do you distinguish a financial opportunity from a labor trafficking trap? Hopefully this doesn't sound too naïve, I genuinely want to learn how this works and have nobody in my life to ask.

- Is Colombia relatively safe for young solo female? I am not sure how well I will blend in as I am a tall pale redhead. But I know not to go out at night, hide my valuables, same precautions I take in any big city alone.

Travelling from Canada to Barcelona for Medical Reasons,"Hello,

I am planning visit Barcelona to obtain medical imaging this January. I have been in contract with a neurosurgeon's office who informed me that I am able to skip quarantining upon arrival as the trip is for a medical appointment.

However, I was reading into the Government of Canada website that details the travel restrictions that says the following ""Travelers arriving from Canada are not allowed entry to Spain. However, certain travelers may be allowed entry if they can prove the essential nature of their travel or if they meet specific criteria.""

However the link to the specific criteria doesn't details what falls under ""essential nature"". I was wondering if the trip is for medical reasons and I have documentation showing I am going to visit a neurosurgeon would I be allowed entry to Barcelona.

Additionally, as I am 21 and unfamiliar with international travel and Barcelona I was wondering if I would additionally be allowed to bring a friend to accompany me on my trip.

1) What are the procedures before I travel to Spain

2) Would I be allowed entry for medical purposes

3) Can I bring a friend to accompany me, and would he or she also be allowed to skip quarantine

Hello all, I've saved enough to take a 6-8 month break from work and not be worried about it. I was planning to travel in June or whenever the world is safe for travel again (whatever comes later). I don't need to hit up too many places but am content with staying longer in a few locations, focusing on my well being and getting immersed in the local culture.

Three things I did want to do are:

1. Learn Spanish (current proficiency: Basic)
2. Photography (current proficiency: Intermediate)
3. Hiking and trail running (current proficiency: Intermediate +)

I wanted your advice/experience on places where I could be part of some Spanish immersion program and have easy and safe access to some great outdoors. (Safe =  where I could hit the trails almost every day without worrying about having a guide or a group accompany me)

Below are a few places I've been to before and would love to return and stay longer, but unsure of the Spanish programs there. Would love feedback on them or any other similar places you'd recommend:

* Peru: Huaraz or Cusco (loved Huaraz!)
* Argentina: Bariloche (though it'll be winter in June/July)
* Spain: San Sebastian (passed through it on a hike and loved the town) or Mallorca
* Guatemala: Antigua or Lake Atitlan (loved it but was always told not to venture far without company)

I've heard great things about Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador but have not been yet. Not a high roller but pretty open on budget.

Thanks for the help!",solotravel,SenorYak
A travel gift from my mother!,"My mom has always been very proud and excited every time I've went on a trip. She has been travelling a lot recently but always says her biggest regret was not travelling more when she was younger. I'll try to take her advice on this compass to the best of my ability!

Easiest and hardest countries to meet people?,"I’ve traveled solo through both Europe and Southeast Asia and while I had met some great people on the road in Europe (who I still remain in touch with), I found the bigger cities like Paris or Budapest to be places you needed to make a bit of an effort (or find a party hostel) to meet people in. Meanwhile in Asia, Thailand and Laos in particular, it was incredibly social, most every traveler I’d meet on a train, in a hostel, or in between seemed willing and interested in meeting with you, it felt quite wonderful (but after a while it could get a bit tiring).

road trip across america. aug 2021 to the new year,"Hi Everybody!

This is my first road trip/solo trip! I am getting out of the military Aug 2021. I am going to sell a lot of my belongings and travel with what I can fit in my toyota corolla.  I plan on traveling across the USA focusing on national parks. I am starting in Charleston SC and ending in Orange County CA. I have to stop in Pittsburgh, Idaho Falls, Seattle, and Saratoga Springs to visit friends. My current plan is to go north to Pittsburg -&gt; NY -&gt; Maine (Acadia National Park) -&gt; Montreal -&gt; then head back to the States. I definitely want to visit Glacier National Park and Olympic National Park. Afterwards it is either straight to Montana -&gt; Idaho -&gt; Washington -&gt; California or Colorado -&gt; Utah -&gt; Idaho -&gt; Montana -&gt; Washington -&gt; California.

Any tips/tricks on planning this road trip? Is Google Maps the best tool to use? Any recommendation on must see locations? Should I skip acadia/montreal and save that for another vacation to make my trip SC-&gt;NY-&gt;PA -&gt; ...?

Should I check in a luggage for my backpacking trip? Is it possible to travel with a 8 kg backpack for my whole trip?,"I plan on doing a backpacking trip across Turkey and potentially parts of the Soviet Union this May. 

My itinerary is

1. Fly from US to Turkey via Paris on Air France. Free 23 kg check in baggage
2. Travel around Turkey using Turkish Airlines, trains, busses, or Skyexpress airlines. All airlines allow free check in baggage 
3. (If all countries lift Covid rules by then): Public transport or Train from Turkey to Georgia. Then Georgia onto Yerevan, Armenia. I will skip this section if countries still have covid rules.
4. Fly from either Turkey or Armenia to Kyiv, Ukraine. Airline will be either Ukraine International or Skyup. 23kg checked baggage will cost $15-$25
5. If the EU allows US travelers by then. Fly from Kyiv to Warsaw Poland on Skyup. Checking in will cost $13 (which is 50% of the cost of the flight). Then fly from Warsaw to Chicago on Tap Portugal. This will cost me an extra $50 vs purchasing the Tap Discount fare. 

So basically, I will be paying an extra $80 ish to bring in a checked in suitcase on board all my flights. I'm just not sure if I can bring 3-4 weeks worth of stuff in a backpack. 

Also, currently all I have are ""school backpacks"". Any particular bags you recommend?",solotravel,Ukrainepolandborder

\- Quit in 3 yrs (at 33, going on 34) with $150k in the bank

Post-pandemic travel to South/Central Americas - What would you do?,"I'm learning Spanish at the moment, and I think by the time travel becomes possible again, I will have a basic handle on how to get by with everyday things.

I have a totally remote job and a very low-cost living situation right now. I have done some international travel in Europe in the past. Cost is probably not an issue.

The idea I'm kicking around is

* Book 3-5 week trip
* Go to place and work from there one-two weeks, enjoy food and nightlife in the mean time
* Go on adventures in that place for the rest of the time.

And the countries I'm kicking around are

* Argentina (BA, Patagonia)
* Chile
* Costa Rica
* Mexico (CDMX, Yucatan)
* Colombia
* Peru

Things I like:

* Trying food I could never find anywhere else
* Mind-bogglingly beautiful vistas and hiking
* Getting a feel for a city
* Coffee
* Beaches, Volcanoes
* Friendly locals

Crazy hostel experiences,"So, I'm not solo travelling (I'm backpacking with my boyfriend) but I thought this would be the best place to share my crazy experience. 

Moved into a hostel about 2 days ago, due to start working for accommodation on Saturday for hostel, so currently still paying. The room i've moved into is next to a noisy room, where people want to stay up late, have their friends in the room til late playing music, banging door to get in. It's annoying.

So after the second night of this happening, wakes me up at 1:30am (i've got work all day for a client so not good) - I knock the door ask them to turn music down, ignored. Knock again, finally stops. 

The next morning, I realise the noisy person is also the night manager and the cleaner, who angrily barks at people who don't clean up after themselves. So instead of going straight to reception to complain, I decide to speak with my new colleague now she is sober, and it's morning to ask her to go downstairs next time she hosts a party because we're neighbours. She goes crazy. Mental. Before I know it, she's cornering me in the bathroom threatening to punch me in the face. I can't move, she's actually physically blocked me with the steam cleaner. I keep my cool, stand my ground, until a girl brushing her teeth breaks it up. But she's not finished with me, she returns seconds later, telling me how she's going to shove my head in the toilet. At this point - I go to the manager, who is already coming out to see what the racket is all about. But the girls following me down the corridor, telling me about how she can't wait to put my head in shit. 

An hour later, she is removed from the hostel and ever since she has been wandering the street, walking around the block for a good solid 6 hours.

Pre travel anxiety,"I am 20 yo and for the last 5 years I've had crazy pre-travel anxiety and I really need some help because all the posts I have seen it is almost always about things you can write down and get over with. Every time I have to travel, even if I have done the same trip, even if the trip is short like 3-4 hours and not only by plane but by train or ship or car, I get a tremendous amount of anxiety to the point I consider canceling the whole trip. For example I have to travel today by train (4 hour trip) to get to my home city for Christmas and even though I have done this trip many times, I still feel very anxious before the trip. These past years I have been basically living with it and not really caring about it, I just know I am going to get anxiety and I just try to go with it and feel bad for the rest of the trip. I have gotten to the point where I vomit because of my anxiety especially when it is at its peak, minutes before the trip begins, ruining my day both emotionally and physically. Also I have to say that I really like traveling and visiting new or old places and different countries but I have to deal with this anxiety. What I mostly feel is stomach ache, nausea, short breathing, dry mouth. Generally sick. Also I know for a fact that I am not afraid of flights, money problems if I lose a connection or anything like that. It just happens when I have to travel. The rest of the time I am very healthy and energetic. I would really like to know if anyone else has this and if they have found a way to cope with it.",solotravel,TheLuckyKoin

"Trip Report: Russian Federation, September / October 2020","Hey brothers and sisters!

After making a lot of research I took the chance and visited Russia for 30 days in September and October 2020. Russia was always a dream destination for me and I was happy that I could still pull it off this year, despite all the obstacles that Corona put upon us.

**Disclaimer:** I am aware that I visited Russia as a foreign citizen for recreational, touristic purposes during a global pandemic. I hereby declare that everyone willing to travel should do his/her careful research about travelling in this era and what the the possible consequences of such a trip are. I therefore am not endorsing nor discouraging anyone from doing a trip nowadays - I'm just saying that you should do your careful research first.

**Background:** 29M Swiss, mostly have adventurous backpacking experience in Asia. Very interested in Russian / former Soviet culture and history. I can read Cyrillic and have some very basic Duolingo Russian skills, but apart from that I can't understand sh** and are pretty bad at everything. The trip took place between September and October 2020, right before the Corona numbers again went off the roof. 

**Budget:** About USD 50 per day, not including airfare or visa fees etc. Because of the current global situation the highest expenditure was the flight Zurich-Moscow and back, which only operated twice a week. But because my flight options were pretty limited I swallowed this bitter pill and did it.

**Length of Travel:** 30 days

**Destinations (not including daytrips):** Saint Petersburg, Petrozavodsk, Moscow, Volgograd, Simferopol, Sevastopol, Yalta, Vladikavkaz, Grozny, Erzi (Southern Ingushetia)

**Accommodations:** Either cheap hotels (found via HotelsCombined or Agoda) or at friends' or at guides' homes.

**Arrival:** The Corona pandemic makes planning an international trip obviously much more difficult than normally. While getting the 30 days visa was not a problem (only citizens from Switzerland, UK or Turkey could obtain tourist visas at that time), I also had to get a negative PCR test result 72 hours prior to my flight (in English or Russian language). This already set me back quite some money and time. At the airport in Switzerland my test result was checked very carefully by the departure staff and arriving in Moscow Domodedovo the Russian officials again checked the result along with my current body temperature. The procedures at immigration and security didn't take too long though (about 1.5 hours) since there were almost no travelling tourists but only returning Russian citizens. Many people were quite amazed to see a foreigner traveling at that time. Immediately after getting my backpack from the baggage claim I headed to the domestic check-in counters and took a domestic flight to Saint Petersburg, which also worked flawlessly.

**Activities:**

* Visiting the many landmarks in Saint Petersburg, such as Peter &amp; Paul, Artillery Museum, Peterhof or Kronstadt
* Visiting Kizhi Island and renting a car to visit other landmarks in Karelia (such as Ruskeala)
* Visiting Moscow and its many landmarks, such as Red Square, Kremlin, Bunker 42, Federation Tower or Monino Aircraft Museum
* Visiting Suzdal (Golden Ring) and its many churches and monasteries
* Visiting Volgograd and its landmarks such as Rossoshka Cemetary, Square of the Fallen Fighters, the war museums, Mamayev Kurgan
* Visiting the Southern part of Crimea, such as Simferopol, Sevastopol, Yalta and Bakhchysarai. Lots of daytrips such as to Artillery Bay, Crimean War panorama, Chersonesus ruins, Maxim Gorky fortress, Submarine base in Balaclava, Cape Fiolent, Ai Petri or Chufut-Khale
* Vladikavkaz, Karmadon Gorge and the Necropolis in Darvgas
* Grozny and a wonderful trek in Galanchezh region of Chechnya
* Southern Ingushetia including treks to Table Mountain and Erzi National Reserve

**What Went Right:** Pretty much everything major - despite the limitations by Corona everything in general went smooth without any incidents. Most landmarks and transporation options worked flawlessly.

**What Went Wrong:** Some few landmarks like Ostankino Tower in Moscow were closed without a comment due to the Corona measures and sadly couldn't be visited. Also many Western bank cards, credit cards and SIM cards won't work in Crimea due to Western sanctions, meaning you need to have some backup. Also because of annoying Corona measures I lost one day of travel between North Ossetia and Chechnya (which is a long story though).

**Recommendations:** GO TO RUSSIA (especially when the whole Corona circus is over).

**Final Verdict:** While maybe not as super adventurous and wild as South East Asia or the Middle East, Russia is a phenomenal mix of European and Oriental influences with extremely many facettes. Compared with other regions in the world it's also a safe and stable destination for a backpacking trip. Locals are lovely and hospitable people, especially in the countryside and in the south. The country simply has everything to offer for every taste, and even within 30 days you can only explore a fraction of the whole picture. While it was not my absolute favorite solo backpacking experience (that would rather be Iran or Vietnam) Russia is still very high in my personal list and I recommend anyone to visit it when things calm down again.

The bitter sting of failed travel romance,"I met this guy (currently travelling in Latin America)... we spent almost a week together whilst staying in the same hostel, kept in touch almost daily for a week afterwards and then tried to get things back on track when we met again in another city, though within a week it had collapsed. I won’t go into detail other than saying it failed because he was a lot less emotionally mature than I was, and I ignored a lot of red flags because our attraction was so intense.

3 weeks to be connected to someone whilst travelling felt like such long time... we were super into each other and even spoke about having feelings for each other and he even alluded to us having future on several occasions. 

 we ended it 3 weeks in and it hurt both of us. We carried on staying in the same town for 2 weeks afterwards and had some miserable and heated run ins. He finally left yesterday and wouldn’t even say goodbye to me. 

It’s a good thing he’s gone but equally It really hurts and I feel quite empty.

Has anybody else experienced similar? I swear it’s those “almost” situationships that hurt the most, and leave you feeling so stupid for getting so carried away in such a short space of time.

When would you feel confident enough to travel internationally again?,"Sorry if this is a repeat post or anything. Curious how other solo travelers are thinking about this.

Would you do anything differently post-pandemic? This is independent of destination, just when you personally would realistically book a trip internationally. Obviously, there has been news around the vaccine, but I think the unique risks of traveling alone make it something to be wary about and you can't be too safe right now.

"As an American, I'm really nervous about being able to go on a good solo trip again before starting a career.","I know I'm not original in my sentiments here.

I had just discovered how much I love international solo travel earlier this year before the pandemic spread far and wide. I was going to make plans to travel more over the summer before going back to school. It would have been perfect, because I wanted to go backpacking once more before getting immersed in my career. Obviously, we've all had to make some sacrifices.

I am going back to school for computer science, and as much as I love it, I'm concerned that I shouldn't make the commitment yet. In the US as far as I'm concerned, it's standard to only get two weeks of vacation time a year. Seeing as how I am not expecting to travel any time soon, even with the vaccine being deployed, I'm so scared! Especially because if I don't get an internship this next summer, I'll have to get one the next. And then I should be ready to graduate, and a gap on my resume would look bad, I think.

I would love to become a digital nomad, but I don't know how realistic that is, especially since I haven't really honed my CS skills yet. I would also really love to move to another country, but I know how hard that is to do, too. Especially since English is my only language.

Any thoughts, advice, or similar feelings? Sorry if I sound whiney! Traveling and experiencing new places/ cultures is really what makes me feel happier to be alive. These past few months have been hard with nothing to look forward to.

Tips to meet people while solo traveling (even if you're awkward af like me),"I commented on someone's post about this but figured I'd make a whole post. I'm a huge fan of making friends while traveling and still keep in touch with random one-off friends I made in weird places. I think it's a special bond. Here are some ways I break the ice. 

**Note:** I've been on both sides of this as the lone traveler who has met and made friends with other solo travelers and groups, as well as the person in a group who has absorbed an orphan traveler into our group for the day/week. 

**These have worked for me:**

* **Wear or carry something distinctive, something that relates to your hobbies or passions.** I put stickers on literally everything and all my stickers relate to my hobbies/interests/bands/shows/books. So many people will stop and be like ""ahh, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sticker!"" or ""The Office!"" (even though everyone loves The Office, doesn't matter). Talking about *something* leads to talking about anything. More people than you realize want to make friends, they just feel weird as hell like you do. I live in Alaska so if I put something that says Alaska on it, people will inevitably comment on it **but** be wary of geographically identifiable clothing as it can make you a target as a tourist in less safe places.
* **Just ask people why they're traveling and where they're from.** Everyone thinks they're a grand explorer when they leave home and they're dying to talk about it.
* **Be interested in listening, don't feel pressured to talk.** Being interested is way more effective in making connections than being *interesting,* as people are more likely to want to hear your stories if they feel bonded to you and not like you're some weird stranger, vomiting your story all over them. So ask questions and actually listen, listening is super rare and always extremely appreciated.
* **Act open and excited, people are drawn to that shit.** Don't be weird, but don't be jaded. Sometimes anxiety can manifest as someone looking bored/disinterested, but nobody wants to have to pry someone out of their shell to get to know them. Be mindful of your paralanguage (non-verbals) and how closed-off you seem.
* **Practice trying new social techniques.** If you fuck it up and make it weird, you will literally never see them again and nothing matters. I've done some insanely awkward shit in the name of travel and while I didn't always make a lifelong friend, I definitely have some interesting stories.
* **Be open to new things.** Just because something doesn't sound fun, doesn't mean it can't lead to something fun. Sometimes I think we travel to distant lands just to do the same shit we do back home. Challenge yourself. Your routine will always be waiting for you back home. For example, I went motorbiking in Bermuda for the first time, it was scary as hell and my new friend broke her ankle and I accidently drove into a prison complex but did I have fun? Fuck yeah.
* **Don't wait for others to do a cool thing.** Do that cool thing and you will invariably find people there who do cool things. Your friends don't want to go to an Irish pub in motherfucking Ireland? Well guess what that pub is full of? People who want to be in Irish pubs. 
* **Take an active interest in the local culture.** Locals love sharing the regional drama, love being experts in their country, and delight in foreigners who aren't just there to see That One Tourist Destination. Most of them will complain about tourists, and that's half the fun. Like I said, in Alaska we joke about Tourist Hunting Season and complain about how our downtowns are flooded with outsiders every summer, but given the chance we will regale you with our crazy outdoor adventures and brag about how our cousin's ex-boyfriend was a crab fisher on season 3 of That Crab Fishing Show Whose Name I Can't Remember.
* **Don't be sloppy.** Nobody wants to hang out a second time with the dumpster person who got blackout and stuck their group with their tab.
* **Go on dates!** (if you're single, obvs) I've met some cool-ass people while traveling and swiping. As long as you're up front about your boundaries and what you're looking for, lots of locals are down for a one-off date and they probably know the ""cool local spot"" that they're excited to show you. I got roasted by Judah Friedlander at a comedy show on a date in NYC once. Probably wouldn't have known about it if my dated hadn't told me about that comedy show. 
* **Lastly, don't get stuck in your demographic.** Some of the coolest people I've met while traveling were way older. For example, when I was 26 I did shots in Iceland with a 65-year-old travel agent while her husband cheered us on and she still sends me periodic updates about her grandkids. Old people are cool as hell, hang out with them.

why don't people try to fight back muggers in colombia?,"from what i understand, going to medellin or bogota is completely law less. it doesn't really matter how ""careful"" you are. if someone so much as sees that you have an iphone, you're basically guaranteed to encounter a mugger, from what i understand. it's ashame, can't even check your phone or the time because you want to avoid giving away you have ""value"" and instantly being marked as a target by potential on lookers

my question is, why don't people fight back? for example, if you know someone is likely to mug you just for walking down the street, why not prepare for it. i've read people get mugged so easily there. just walking in broad daylight around some people, then 2 guys approach you and pull out a knife, demand your phone, and then run off. and everyone around you just continues on with their day as if nothing happened, cause it's just so normal for that to happen

how about having some mace on hand, so that when you are approached and see the knife, you basically mace the guy in the face, give one swift kick to the balls, then just be on your merry way. it's not like others will stop you from doing this, or you will be caught by cops?",solotravel,itcantbestopped11
Kindness to a Weary Moroccan Traveler,"I love travelling. I've been solo traveling since I was in my twenties and actually prefer it because of the adventures I've had, though I look forward to including my partner one of these days. I'm really bummed right now, though about how unsafe and difficult it is to go anywhere, so I've been thinking about stories from the past. I wanted to share the experience that convinced me to keep solo traveling.

In 2007, I was a university student during a year abroad in Canterbury, England. On the advice of some people who had been in my program the year before, I decided not to go home, back to the states, for Christmas, but instead stay there and use the time for traveling. While most of my friends were going to Amsterdam for the legal pot, I had my heart set on going to Morocco because I wanted to experience Northern Africa, the first time I would be in a country where I was not the dominant race. I figured that it would be perfect to spend Christmas there since, as a predominantly Muslim country, I figured most business would be open through the season.

So, once classes were out for the winter break, I took a Ryanair flight over to Barcelona and spent a week in Spain before hoping on a bus from Madrid to the port city of Algeciras to catch the ferry over to Tangier.

Now about all that went as expected was I found where to purchase the tickets for my ferry and went over to the waiting area. I wasn't sure when the ferry would take off, but I figured it had to be soon. So I waited. And waited, And waited some more. I was there hours before it was time, evening slipped into night, and the waiting area was quickly filling up. I sat there until the wee hours of the morning, unsure when I was finally going to get to go but not terribly worried since I had no firm plans. Finally they started loading the boat, and I found myself on a cramped ferry and could only plop down on the floor in an empty space. I had no idea why so many people seemed to be trying to get to Morocco that night.

It was early the next morning, around 7:00 am by the time we got to Tangier. I was hungry and exhausted and really wanted to find a place to get some rest before continuing on down the coast the next day. As I was disembarking from the ferry, though, I was pulled aside, along with a few other people and had to wait for a rather gruff and unhappy looking customs officer to come talk to me. It turns out that the way customs works on this particular ferry is you get your passport stamped on the boat and then just show your passport as you disembark. There had been announcements but, because they were all in Spanish and Arabic, I didn't understand them. I was horrified and scared he was going to send me back to Spain but, after some questioning, he took out a stamp, stamped my passport, and sent me on my way.

I immediately realized something was up when I saw people literally on the street corners cooking goats. I would come to find out that, yes, I had escaped the Christian holidays in Britain, but my uncultured self forgot to check the Muslim calendar. I had arrived on Eid al-Adha, one of the holiest days on the Muslim calendar, and I was witnessing people out celebrating and preparing their feast. That's why there were so many people on my ferry. I started to panic: I knew I would be lucky that day to find a meal, much less lodging, that day.

I had picked out a pension, a small, cheap hotel, to stay in for the night, and found a taxi driver, who had no idea where it was. After driving around in circles, I asked him to drop me back off at the port, and then I realized the pension was only a block from the port on a pedestrian street. I walked up to the pension and stood at the front desk, exhausted, hungry, and more than a bit weary from the last twenty-four hours.

The owner of the pension walked up to the desk, a little surprised to see a customer at this time of the morning. I asked him if he had any rooms. Yes, he told me he did. I felt elated. For the first time this trip, something was going right.

""But I will not check you in!"" he told me. I looked at him, baffled. What was going on? Had I already offended him? Did I break some taboo without even knowing?

Sensing my confusion, he repeated, ""I will not check you in!"" He paused, looked at my face, and smiled. ""It is a holy day! I will not check you in until you have tea with me!""

It took me a moment to process what he'd just said. This man, who didn't know me, who had just met me, was asking me to have tea with him in honor of the Eid. I'd like to think he saw in my face a weary soul, way out of my element, and wanted to show me some kindness.

I did sit with him and with an Indian man I would find out was a regular at the pension. We talked about life. I told them my story as we had Moroccan mint tea with some bread and honey. I told them my story (the Indian man was briefly confused when I said I was from Indiana) and they told me theirs. We learned about one another that day. I also expressed my fear of not being able to find food on the Eid, and the owner reassured me.

""You are staying in my pension. You will eat tonight!""

I was overwhelmed by his generosity and, just before midday, crawled into a bed on the second floor, sleeping sounder than I had in ages.

That man is why I keep travelling. Travelling keeps reaffirming my belief that most people are basically good and want to be good people. His hospitality to a complete stranger who would have stayed at his pension even without it was so touching. I have since encountered generous, kind people in so many countries on multiple continents. The pension owner taught me that, even in a new country where I don't know the language or customs or traditions, even after a long, stressful day, there were people who could touch you and lift your spirits with a simple act of kindness.

I hope I'm half as good a person as that man.",solotravel,queerly_radical

Does anyone else not meet people when they travel?,"I read a lot of stories and threads in this sub that are detailing the amazing experiences that people have meeting other people, sex, travel romance and to me I can’t relate to any of that because I never meet anyone when I travel. Does anyone else not meet people? 

I still have fun but all my experiences are solo experiences I’ve not had a shared experience before which goes against what this sub usually experiences. 

People say they meet other people on walking tours; I’ve never been on a walking tour that didn’t just end at the finish and when we tip the tour guide people just went off and do their own thing. The last two walking tours I went to the majority of people there clearly knew each other and stuck with each other. 

Saying hello to people never seems to go past an introductory phase or the usual ‘where are you from’

I’ve been on tours and not met anyone. I went on a full day tour that involved boating and everyone there clearly knew each other and had formed their own groups and were talking together in their own languages so I ended up spending the day by myself getting the cuntest sunburn of all time. 

The most awkward tour was when it was me and these two women who knew each other, there was a 4th person but he cracked the shits about something and went off raging in to the sunrise and after trying to strike a conversation with the others and getting nowhere I just left it

In hostels I’ve not met anyone either. I usually go out during the day, come back for a snooze in the afternoon then go out for dinner and drinks in the evening and maybe it’s just bad timing but most of the hostels were either empty in the common area at the time or people were with their friends or doing some undisturbed so I usually do my thing alone. I go to bars alone and don’t meet locals but I usually don’t speak the language well enough. 

There was one hostel where there was a group dinner advertised so I went there, sat down, started saying hello and what not and the entire table was speaking French - I was neither in France nor am I French so I just left. 

On the days where I’ve not wanted to do much I noticed most people did the same thing I did going out during the day and night so the hostels were mostly empty and there wasn’t a “hey we both got nothing to do let’s go do something” person around. 

Maybe it’s just me doing something wrong I don’t know but my experience of travelling seems to be the complete opposite of the stories people post in here. Surely someone else has the same experience when they travel? I don’t find it to be the super social experience people say it is but maybe that’s because I won’t disturb a group if they know each other or speaking other languages to each other which I’d consider rude. 

I’ll usually try and say hello how are ya etc like when I was at hostel and got dinner I sat outside on the table and a group was already there but it didn’t go further than that. For whatever reason people don’t seem receptive to me and timing also doesn’t seem to align when meeting people so I usually just end up going to bars by myself, get hammered and find my way home some how.

It doesn’t really bother me too much since I don’t have any friends where I live so it’s no different and I’m used to isolation but I guess I had that expectation that travelling and doing things like tours and staying hostels gets people together when it doesn’t end that it doesn’t matter where I am in the world I’m still the same loser there as I am here",solotravel,PMmeYOURBOOBSandASS
Best/safest places to visit as a solo female?,"Hello! I am 24 years old (from Illinois, USA) and have traveled various places throughout my life with my family/friends but as soon as the travel restrictions start lifting and COVID is better I would like to do a solo trip somewhere! I have to admit that I’m nervous to travel alone as a female so I was wondering if anyone has any experiences/advice to share with me? Also, are there any places in the world where solo travelers (of all genders) feel safest? Anything helps! Thank you!

Edit: I’m sorry if I offended anyone not from the US! I was not trying to insinuate that America is the safest place I know we have our problems and a lot of troublesome and dangerous places here and I am careful to avoid these places! I was more curious where else in the world I can travel to gain some new experiences that seem to be safer than other places!

Am I the only one who does this?,"I’m female in my late 30’s. Looking back on my years of solo travel adventures, I seem to have constant affairs with hotel/hostel workers.
Here’s a few of them: 

Egypt: 26 year old hotel manager in Cairo. Was upset I was dating another Egyptian guy. Bought me gifts, took me out to restaurants and an amazing day trip to the Red Sea. Had sex in my room twice. (All with protection of course) 

Dubai: half Emirati half Yemeni guy working at the check in desk. We flirted. After 3 days, brought me dinner to my room. Had sex. 

India: 22 year old Rajasthani guy who worked hard to become manager of hostel. Would flirt and bring me chai to my room every morning. He jumped into bed with me. 

Nepal: 28 year old upper class Nepali guy who’s parents owned 3 hotels. Took me on his motor bike to the most amazing restaurants and temples. Had sex twice in my room. When I left he slept in my bed for a week without changing the sheets. 

Kuwait: Syrian guy. Flirted for a while. Came to my room to watch tv. Took of his pants and asked if I like what I saw. I did. 

Tunisia: a guy my age working at the front desk. Took me around Carthage, trendy bars and restaurants. We took a road trip Down to the Sahara desert for the weekend. 

Morocco: Moroccan hotel manager who took me to all the souls in Marrakech and shared my bed for 2 nights

Cancun: head chef at resort from Vera Cruz. Cooked me amazing food and would come to my room after dinner service with a bottle of champagne 

I had a great time with all of them, but surely I’m not the only girl they do this to. I’m sure they hit up every attractive girl that comes through the doors.

Favorite nonwestern countries for solo? (travel scholarship ideas),"Hi! What was your favorite nonwestern location you traveled to? What was your fav experience there?

I'm applying for a travel scholarship that sponsors you to solo travel around the world for half a year, but only to nonwestern areas (no europe or australia, etc). I KNOW I want to go, but the problem is that I've never left america and honestly, I don't know that much about other countries. My itinerary is gonna have 6+ countries from 2 major world regions and I will spend a lot of time in each. I have some places in mind, but I would love to learn about what other solo travelers say. 

My interests: relatively unseen locations, places that have cultural festivals or events that I can catch at a certain time of the year (like carnival or oktoberfest), places with cool nightlife, beautiful natural environments I can explore, places where its easy to meet people. Pretty much any and everything. I'm looking for a diverse array of experiences, the more foreign, the better. I hardly know what type of things are even out there.

When have you splurged way beyond your normal budget and was it worth it?,"I stayed for 80 euros for one night in a hotel in Northern Greece. Might not be huge bucks to some but considering I'm a life long backpacker who is normally slumming it in 5-12 euro dorms. 

It's because I was cycle touring and I ended up stranded in a small place with literally no other options. 

I mean, it was a nice place. Breakfast was amazing. Room was amazing. You can get very very nice hostels too with nice breakfasts but it did make me feel that for at least one day on every extended trip I should enjoy a taste of the (relative!) high life.  
Edit: One nice thing was that, because presumably they aren't used to cycle tourists in nice hotels and the hotel was quiet (low season) I got a bit of the old VIP treatment! A very exuberant Greek chef came out when I was having my breakfast with an extra dish or two saying things like ""this very special Greek pie - will give you lots of energy for your cycling!"" And then gave me a few chocolates to give me more energy for my journey. Especially welcome as that morning turned out to otherwise be a very rainy miserable morning of cycling. 


On the other hand, I paid similar for a premier inn some random ass town in Southern England when I missed my train and again had no options. And it was literally no nicer, if not less nice, than a good hostel.

That's hotels though - there's also tours; attraction fees; transport; meals; whole destinations like Bhutan, the high arctic, North Korea, Turkmenistan or Pacific islands generally (I've been to two from that list: Papua New Guinea and Svalbard and both were worth it). 

I feel this is relevant to solo travel as things like hotels are more expensive to us and we are much more likely to slum it in general, but interested in your takes.",solotravel,pooey_mcpooface
Which country/destination made you truly feel like the adventurers or explorers of the past ?,"Hey everyone how's it going ?


If it wasn't for a certain pandemic I would be eagerly awaiting my solo trip to Peru and Bolivia which isn't going to happen anytime soon so I thought might as well plan my future bucket lists when international travel is allowed again. 


Now I know in this day and age there really isn't any truly 'uncharted' territory left and everything has been discovered and if its worth doing I wont be the first one there nor will I be the last. I mean if you really wanted to you can even book a trip to both the North and South pole or even climb Mt Everest (for a heavy price). 

I've been to Nepal for EBC and Tanzania for Mt Kili and although they are both extremely popular tourist destinations far from being 'uncharted' or 'off the beaten path' they still gave me the feeling of being a 'adventurer' in a 'unknown world' 


So I'm pretty much after locations/destinations that gave you the feeling like you are in the unknown wilderness far from civilisation and completely untouched or forgotten by humanity. Essentially if the destination or journey made you feel like the explorers and adventures of old I definitely want to hear about it ! 


Thank you for your time and have a great day. Take care !",solotravel,Nugget93
Dolomites/swiss alps questions,"Hey y'all, I've been inspired by this subreddit to plan my first solo international trip for next summer and was wondering if anyone with experience in these places could help clarify a few specific things for me or at least point me in the right direction. 

My first question is that I plan to stay in a lot of rifugios/mountain huts in Italy and the swiss alps and I notice some websites say to ""bring your own sleeping bag""... Does that mean like an actual sleeping bag you'd bring camping/backpacking or something else? Because I also notice from pictures that the beds have a folded blanket on top of them. Also for rifugio locatelli's reservation page, it gives me the option of ""beds with bed linen (in 2,3,4 bed rooms) or mattress storage"" for accommodation type and I can't figure out what the difference is between those. It might be a weird English translation thing? 

My other question is regarding parking at tre cime to stay at that rifugio. In my current plan, I would arrive there by car in the afternoon, like around 2 or 3pm, but I've seen the internet say that the parking lot fills up by 10am. I assume people continually leave throughout the day so is it ACTUALLY possible that I could be blocked out from parking up there that day, even with an overnight reservation up there? 

Thanks! I'm from the US and my goal is to go end of august-early Sept if I'm vaccinated by then (probably)",solotravel,derpina321
What is the most unbelievable thing to happen to you while travelling solo?,"One of my favourite things about solo travel is the fact that it forces you to go outside your comfort zone. It's a lot easier to say yes to things you wouldn't usually do and this can result in the most insane/hilarious/scary/incredible things happening which are often some of the best memories of trips away. 

The one annoying thing I've found though, is when I get home and I'm telling people about my trip. I can sometimes tell that some of my friends think I'm bullshitting them with Walter Mitty-esque tales. It doesn't bother me too much but it's sometimes frustrating when I'm being honest but I don't have someone to corroborate my story. 

With that in mind, and with the promise that I'll believe your story no matter how insane it might sound, what is the most unbelievable event (or events) that has actually happened to you on your travels?

Who was the oddest person you ever met at a hostel?,"I don't necessarily mean it in a sinister way. Just like... the most odd/BIZARRE (not OLD 🙃). 

I was in one of the Budapest Party hostels about 5 years ago and one of the other solo travellers there was obsessed with chess. Would only talk about chess. Commandeered the hostel chess set and went from group to group trying to play it with every guest. Absolutely dominated all of them. After the win, he would move on without saying much. 

On my last day there, I was his lucky chosen one. We started playing. I'm shit at chess. He took my queen after 5 or so moves. 

At this point one of the staff announces that anyone coming on the hostel organised day trip has 10 minutes to meet at the reception before they head off. Mr Chess must have reserved a place on this trip because he was getting noticeably nervous and prompting me to hurry up everytime it was my turn. I was getting destroyed so I of course purposefully slowed down. 

The ten minutes passed and he had to leave. Our match was far from over and he was freaking out. He insisted that we took a picture of the board and continued where we left off when he returned. He then quickly shovelled all the chess pieces into the box and brought the chess set with him on the day trip. 

After they left, I packed my stuff and moved on to Croatia. 

I often think about him and wonder if I was the only person he didn't beat on his trip.

* Guides - I feel guide is important as there is so much history related to this place. I am not sure who i can hire them for a day or two. Would like to get a reliable source. 
* Tips - Looks like Egypt has a tipping culture ( atleast on the tourist sites) , I saw on the video's that people would expect tips if they help you take pictures or in transportation. Is it a must to tip ? how much would you tip ? I have no problem tipping in restaurants or for a cab , but for a picture ? Please let me know. 
* Covid - What is covid situation is Egypt ? I do not see much info online. Not that I am going to cancel the trip now  but any information will be helpful 

Places visiting 

* Cairo 
* Luxor / Aswan (may be)
* Dahab

Travel 

I am planning to travel in bus/train in between the cities. Will be taking ferry to Sharm. Does any one know if they are on operation ? One of the video I checked said it only runs/floats , during the peak season. Apparently this is a peak season , but we are all aware of the condition now. 

Interest in Egypt

* Culture 
* History 
* Diving

Anybody else not care about being the stupid American?,"Rn I'm in north Africa and I do a lot of stereotypically American things. I feed the stray animals, I give beggars money, I talk to strangers and I'm very friendly with them. (I'm actually half north African so I'm sensitive to the culture and know it well.)

Sometimes it hurts my feelings when they don't know I understand the language (even if I can't speak it very well) and I hear them make fun of me or intentionally overcharge me but I don't care if they think I'm being stupid. I don't care if this is extremely stereotypically American and I look naive and cringey.

I think that a lot of the advice about doing the norm in that country is often over hyped. As long as you're being respectful of the people and culture it doesn't matter if you look like a stupid American.

Maybe I asked the wrong question... so here's a list of em.,"How has travelling changed you as a person?

What type of people did you meet along the way that had the biggest impact on your growth? 

How can I maximize my growth overseas? (i.e backpacking or living rough, etc.)

Has your perspective on the world or yourself changed?

If you had considered yourself a less empathetic and possibly irritable and angry, or uncertain and lost person, did solo travelling help with this? 

Basically, can I really 'find myself?'

What is the best way to go about this? I want to travel to a cheap country (like Laos), backpack for a minimum of 3 months, have lots of time with myself to self reflect and become more in tune with my thoughts and feelings, while building empathy, compassion, perspective and understanding so I can ensure that when I come back, I can be different and not make the same mistakes.",solotravel,buttpastaa

Going to Greece next November - Aegina vs. Mycenae?,"I'm (hopefully) going to Greece in November if the pandemic allows for it to happen by then. I only have three full days, not including the day I arrive and leave, and I'm going to be spending 2 of them in Athens. For the third day, I'd like to take a day trip, but I'm not sure where.

I love history and culture and those are my two main interests in traveling. Mycenae is obviously a great historical sight, but I'd like to soak in at least one island and explore the natural beauty of Greece, since I know that's a huge attraction that all my friends and family tell me I need to see before I leave the country. The problem with Aegina though is that I'm not sure how lively the islands are during November and whether most stores, restaurants and attractions will still be open during that time of the year. 

Alternatively, I could spend an extra day in Greece and try doing both, but then I'd have to subtract a day from my Istanbul plans (I'm currently planning on four full days in Istanbul after Greece. It would be three if I want to spend another day in Greece.) I just feel pretty overwhelmed because there are so many options at hand, lol.

Turkish E-visa question- Do I have to wait 180 days between each trip to apply for a new e-visa?,"I am a Bangladeshi national planning a trip to Turkey at some point next year when things get better. Because I have a valid US visa I qualify for the e-visa, but this (image) is the only option that I qualify for (30 day single entry valid for the next 180 days, starting from when I apply)

I am wondering if I can stay in Turkey for 30 days, leave and go to Georgia/Egypt/Balkans and come back a month later with a new e-visa? Or will I not be allowed to reapply until the 180 day period for the original one isn't over. If the latter is the case, I would apply for my visa 4-5 months ahead of my trip and time my trip just right, so I can leave for a month, wait out the ending of the 180 day period and re-enter with a new e-visa application. I was hoping someone more familiar with this would be able to correct me if I am misunderstanding the rules here. Thanks in advance

Solo Female trip to Nairobi in September,"  Hi Everyone, 

 Scott's Cheap Flights delivered once again! $650 USD tickets to Nairobi. Now this was pretty was spontaneous so I still have a lot of planning to do but you guys are really great with recommendations so I'll start here. Would love your recommendations, tips, tricks, must sees for Nairobi:

Interest: Mostly outdoor, camping, hiking, whitewater, beach, mountains, wildlife, art, Avant Gard, weird stuff, cooking

Length – Friday to following Saturday (9 days)

Budget – Would like to be as frugal as possible but willing to spend for the big experiences (treks, safari, flights, tours, etc). I anticipate either renting a car or hoping on a regional flight at some point for a few days outside of Nairobi. I can sleep anywhere that is safe and hope to camp at some point as well (either alone or with a tour). I prefer hostels over AirBnB or hotels if possible.

Other Considerations: I only speak English, I can read and understand French at a beginner level. I don’t know how to drive stick shift. I have experience travelling solo in Mexico, Slovenia, Barcelona, and USA. 

Questions on Car Rentals: Are there any surprises? Like in Mexico where the rental is $5 a day but the mandatory insurance is $500. 

Currency?: Should I expect local cash exchanges only or can I use my travel credit card?

Ideally, I imagine a few days in the capital and then the rest of the time travelling around Kenya via car, or possibly getting on a plan and travelling to somewhere else in the region. Flights to the continent of Africa are usually $1200+ in my area so I want to take advantage of the opportunity.

"Want to go see the world on my own, but I'm not sure if I was built too","Hey all, 20M here from the UK. For the longest time I've been fascinated with the countries of the world and the people and cultures in them. I really want to go start seeing them at some point, I have a super strong urge to just travel all over Europe this upcoming Spring (provided lockdown is over by then of course). However, I have some conditions that I think will make this quite hard. The big one is that I have a form of ASD and therefore can be prone to panic and being overwhelmed in unfamiliar environments. To add to this, I can sometimes have extreme difficulties in socialising because of it, although this has become much less of a problem in recent years. But a few years back when I was travelling in the UK on my own, I ended up having something of a total breakdown and have been put off going abroad ever since. Although I am still not sure what incited this breakdown since I was deeply depressed at the time but I'm now on medication which has made me much less prone to these incidents. 

I am not at all experienced with travelling abroad, with the exception of a few days in Paris on a high school trip over five years ago lol. Mainly because of the fear that my anxiety disorders and depression would just get the better of me for when I travel alone, as it has done domestically. I finish uni next Summer, having been locked on my own for nearly half of the three years I had spent there due to Covid and whatnot so I'm really eager to go explore when it is all over but I'm just not sure I have it in me to pull it off successfully. 

Has anyone else had similar experiences before they started solo travelling? I'm twenty now but I've never done anything exciting and I'm so desperate to change that for when I can travel again, make the most of living while I'm young, you know? Because at the moment I just want to live an exciting life but I am just worried that my disabilities and disorders may prevent me from experiencing that.

Cycletouring in the US?,"Hey guys.

So, due COVID cancellations I have a bunch of carrier flight points to use in the US and wanted to spend 1-2 months in the country. Never been to the US before and I am planning to rely on buses and my bike to travel around as much as I can.

Thing is, this would be my first international bike trip, and my first time in the US. I would land in JFK and cycle down Washington and then Virginia. Then rely on buses around Southern US (I plan to go to Texas visit a friend). My trip would end in Grand Canyon, then taking another transportation to get a flight back home from California.

I need to understand the logistics to carry the bike case and panniers, and also how much is feasible to travel around the country using my bike and buses. How much does it cost to carry this stuff in int. flights? Can I put my case in travel buses in the US? Also, is it dangerous to do solo cycletourism in the US?

Recommendations on where I should go! (first major solo travel ~ 3 weeks),"Hello, hope everyone is staying safe during these crazy times....
TL;DR

In my early/mid twenties from USA and will have about 3.5k to spend on a 3 week trip. Trying to decide between: South East Asia, Japan, or Europe 
Or if you have any other recs plz lmk!

Just a little background, I did my first ever backpacking trip with a friend from college in Europe for ~ 1 month. It was fantastic, but honestly my favorite part of the trip was when we split up for about a week (no drama or anything, he just went to see family) and i got to experience staying in a hostel by myself and planning all my own activities. I was so surprised at how easy it was to meet people and felt so free not having to plan around someone else!

That was about 1.5 years ago(summer 2019, I know, we got so lucky we got that trip in before all this happened) and honestly, ever since then I’ve been dreaming about my next trip (solo) and saving for it. So far I have about 2.5k saved for a trip and am planning to save another 1k in the coming year. So ~3.5k in total is my budget

After I get the vaccine and travel is back to normal I’m thinking I’m going to take 3 weeks off work either 4th quarter 2021 or early 2022.

Looking for recommendations on where I should go. I’ve heard South East Asia is really good for first time solo travelers and has an established backpacker infrastructure but the only place I’m really interested in so far would be Thailand. I imagine 3 weeks would be too much time in one country but lmk if you think otherwise or have any other recommendations in SEA.

I’ve also always been fascinated with Japan and really want to visit Tokyo/Osaka. However I know that not much English is spoken and I worry it would be a little too much for a first time solo trip. Also Japan will be there and maybe better for when I am older (in early/mid twenties rn)

And my last thought is to go back to Europe and go to some of the countries I skipped/really liked. Portugal and Spain. Or maybe go with the northern route. I did really like Europe!

I know this is pretty vague and I’m super fortunate to have still been employed and be able to save this amount for a trip. Any recommendations would be helpful on those 3 I talked about or honestly if you have an entirely different place I hadn’t thought about please do tell!!!
And do you think 3.5k is a good budget for 3 weeks? Or if that is that overkill, I could always spend less and save the rest for my next solo trip down the line.

What Are Some Easily Accessible (no car) but Beautiful Hiking Routes Throughout Europe?,"Hello, everyone! 
I'm a solo traveller (19F) intending on catching up on my travels in (mostly) Eastern Europe once us Canadians are all vaccinated and once we are advised that it is safe to travel internationally again. I think you all understand that now is the time to daydream and plan, while we are all stuck at home!
I'll have to go over the summer-time since I'm still a student and have May to August free. I am not old enough to rent a car, so I'll be flying and using trains and buses to get around. I love to day hike and am experienced and spry enough to attempt some fairly tough mountainous adventures. I won't have a tent or anything, since I'll be carrying all my supplies in a single carry-on bag, so overnight hikes are a no-go, especially since I'm a lone lady. 
Do you have any good and solo-safe recommendations for day hikes that I can walk, hike, bus, or train near to its trailhead? I'll be spending most of my time backpacking in Eastern Europe, but will be commencing my journey in the UK and France, and will continually keep my eyes open to cheap flights to Greece and surrounding islands, and also the Nordic countries. If there are any unmissable and easily accessible hiking spots that are safe for solo adventures and that are along common tourist routes, I would love to know! If any of the hikes are special in specific months, like some of the hikes in Norway with its Aurora Borealis season, that would also be great to know.

I finally found personal value in keeping a travel log,"Memories are something that I cherish and travelling brings me some of the most valuable memories I've ever had. However, some of them are lost from my mind and there are personal experiences that I should record because they were perceived from my own eyes, ears, etc. There are also places that I want to return to, and there's always the possibility that various attractions will be added or modified over time. That is mostly why I want to have a travel log now so that I can personally see history play out with my own eyes and take in my environment in the most gleeful, optimistic way I can. Outside of my work-a-day life, I want to tread wherever I can on my own and find the constantly changing beauties of the world and forever embed those moments into my mind. I've already been to Bangkok, but I'd like to compare it to the underacknowledged Chiang Mai, and a travel log will definitely help me with that to the fullest extent possible",solotravel,tennlene
Does anyone else feel like traveling will suck for a couple years after COVID?,"Once most of the world is vaccinated, and assuming things open up enough that we go back to some semblance of normal, millions of people who have been cooped up in their homes are going to want to get out at the same time.

I expect to see demand for hotels and flights surge, with prices skyrocketing, and travel destinations being swarmed with tourists. As someone who doesn't mind the usual tourists, but finds solace in a quiet, less-crowded nook of a city or travel site, I feel like we're not going to get anywhere near that at least for a few years until everyone scratches their travel itch and start to forget about home lockdowns all together. 

Of course, I don't have a crystal ball and could be way off the mark, but I just had this thought recently and was wondering if others feel the same.

Need Help With International Phone Plans,"I'm in the process of planning my first solo international trip, optimistically for late spring/early summer 2021, and I'm at the point where I'm trying to figure out what phone plan I need.  

I am surprisingly technologically inept for being a millennial, so my absolute number one requirement would be convenience and a hassle-free experience.  Essentially, I want to step off the airplane and have my phone work normally as it would at home.

Through my research I am currently leaning towards Google Fi, it seems to be the easiest to use and also works immediately in most countries.  However, I have also seen good things about T-Mobile plans and of course the very popular and common method of buying local sim cards, however, that adds a few more steps to the process of having my phone operate normally in foreign countries.

I would appreciate any advice/suggestions and I'm interested in hearing from Google Fi users as well.  Thanks!",solotravel,Custer_Had_It_Coming

I really like the idea that all of my transportation logistics will be handled by someone else and that the price includes some activities.

Has anyone from the US tried booking a trip overseas recently?,"I have vouchers from Iberia airlines left over from Covid, they have to be used by June 2021. 

I keep getting emails from them reminding me to use them, so yesterday I figured why not… I  found a good trip to Barcelona, went through the whole process of applying the voucher and putting my credit card info in, and after trying multiple times, it wouldn’t accept my payment. 

my thought process was… I know that we’re currently banned from traveling there, but I’m hoping we will be able to by the summer. I figured I could just book the trip and if we were still banned, I would reschedule it again. 

I didn’t think that there would be some sort of gatekeeping mechanism in place on the airline website, but I could be wrong.

Best places in the US for solo women,"I realized I haven't traveled much domestically, so would love any suggestions for destinations and journeys in the US for a solo female traveler. Some considerations:

- I’ve lived in large East Coast cities (NYC/Boston/DC), and in general, would like to avoid spending too much time in very large cities like LA etc. I’m thinking more like smaller cities (e.g. New Orleans or Portland, ME) or non-cities.

- Length: 2-3 weeks.

- I'd love to see as much of the country I can by train, like how people buy an Interrail/Eurail pass to see Europe. I can’t drive, and while flying is an option, I’d ideally want scenic views during the journey.

- Budget: I’m unsure about this, so estimates would be helpful. I’ve saved up and was thinking around $4k, and while obviously the less the better, I’m willing to go up a bit if that seems unrealistic. I’m not seeking luxury, but want to be reasonably comfortable and safe.

- Interests: Food is super important, I don’t care where I get it from as long as it’s delicious; no dietary restrictions, and am very open to trying new foods. I also love to just walk around, surrounded by beautiful scenery or interesting architecture. Not as interested in museums or nightclubs.

- Safety: I’m a woman of color, so yeah, while I wish this were an irrelevant fact, anything that minimizes my risk of sexual assault/racism would be great.

Thanks in advance!

Europe in Three weeks,"So I booked a Contiki for April this year, and low and behold COVID happens and everything gets cancelled 4 weeks before I'm supposed to travel. I've accepted that it was actually a great thing because I realized that the trip included places I didn't particularly want to see (because it was included in the overall trip), and I don't want to waste valuable time in a bus. So I am going at it alone, I'm planning to go to Paris, Italy (Florence, Rome, Venice), Berlin, Amsterdam and London. 

\- PARIS 4 DAYS - FLORENCE 2 DAYS - ROME 3 DAYS - VENICE  2 DAYs - BERLIN  3 DAYS  - AMSTERDAM  3 DAYS.

How reasonable does this sound? The Contiki trip was 1500 euros for 14 days but from my planning its coming to about 1000 euros (my budget in total is 2000 euros but I can go over). 

 The plan is to just book hostels/airbnbs and use flights/trains to travel between cities. Please recommend some trustworthy sights that I can use compare/book on, I've just been using google and going off of that.

Does anyone else go through a week-long phase every year or so where they get insanely excited about solotravel?,"That's what's been happening to me this week! I've been nonstop reading through posts on this subreddit, looking through my old travel blog/photos, researching plane tickets, visa requirements and so on.... I think being all cooped up in quarantine is giving me even more travel-lust

So as a result I decided to plan on my next big trip! In March of 2023, I will have been at my current job for three years and will have certainly saved up more than enough to take a year off for solotravel. I plan on giving my notice and then starting my travels in May of that year. Here is my loose itinerary:

# PART 1: THE MEDITERRANEAN, EASTERN &amp; CENTRAL EUROPE

**May:** Fly to Israel via Birthright. Since I'm Jewish I can go on an all-expenses-paid 10 day trip to Israel. The catch is it's not solotravel because I'll be with a group, and also I'm really not a Zionist, but hey it's a free plane ride to the middle east. After the trip is over I plan on hoping over to Istanbul where I'll spend the rest of the month couchsurfing and exploring the city

**June:** Start moving westward. I'd like to check out Sofia and Athens. Maybe I'll find a workaway/helpx program to join for a few weeks

**July**: Work my way up the Adriatic Sea and check out Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia.

**August:** Head to Budapest and spend 2-3 weeks there. This was my favorite city when I did my very first solotrip in 2012 and I always wish I could have spent more than just a few days there. Towards the end of the month, I'll start working my way north into Slovakia and then Poland where I'd like to pay my respects at a concentration camp.

**September:** Head to Berlin, where I'll spend most of the month couchsurfing or helpxing. I have some friends there from my 2016 SEA trip I'd like to reconnect with!

# PART 2: THE HIMALAYAS &amp; SOUTH ASIA

**October:** With the cold weather approaching in Europe, it'll be time to change things up! I plan on flying from Berlin to Kathmandu to spend a month trekking. I hear this is the best time of year as the monsoon will have just ended

**November:** India! After I'm done trekking I'd like to check out Delhi and Rajasthan. As usual I'll be couchsurfing, helpxing and staying in hostels

**October:** Start working my way further south and spend a good chunk of time in Mumbai

**November:** Continue southward and spend time in Goa

**December:** Explore the southern tip of India I guess? I honestly have no idea what's even there and what to expect but why not!

**January:** Sri Lanka! I think I could spend a month here

**February:** If at this point I've had enough of South Asia, I'd like to check out Japan for a month before heading back home (big bucketlist item is to stay in a capsule hotel). I'm thinking a couple weeks in Tokyo, a couple weeks exploring rural japan.

**March:** Pit stop in Costa Rica to see some family and then head back to the USA to begin job hunting and piecing my life back together!

How's this all sound? Is it crazy to be planning like this 2 1/2 years ahead of time? I feel like my India plan could be more fleshed out, I really don't know much about India, but I guess that's part of the appeal!",solotravel,Retawekaj

Serendipitous solo travel moments,"I remember when I was making my way from Vietnam to Thailand. I was sitting in the Hanoi airport on the way to Bangkok and made eye contact with another traveler taking the same flight. I didn’t really think anything of it until we noticed each other again waiting for a taxi in Chiang Mai. We went our separate ways but were again brought together at a 7-11 a  number of hours later buying the same snacks and water. 

At this point, we spoke and decided the coincidence was too strong to ignore. We shared the rest of the evening at a nearby bar, had a great conversation, drinks, and food, and then parted our separate ways. It was as if we’d known each other for years - such an impactful experience. I tried to get her contact info so we could meet up in the future, but must've taken it down incorrectly so I never saw her again.

"How to go out in ""riskier"" countries?","Hey!

So I've traveled to a few places before and stayed at hostels. However this has been mainly in Western Europe and Japan. Japan is extremely safe and I feel comfortable walking home with someone I met at the hostel completely shit faced at 2 in the morning. The same goes for European countries where I know what I'm doing. Of course there is always a safety risk but I see the risk as quite low. But here comes my problem: in poorer places or just places that are not as safe, how do you go out? I'm asking this because I'm currently in Colombia but I'm too afraid to do anything. I'll go out during the day and explore but avoid the bad areas (again being very cautious) and have an early dinner and stay at the hostel. I'm afraid to go out in to the dark streets of Colombia and go drinking somewhere. If we are in a big group I'll go out but avoid having more than a beer. I constantly read stories here about people going out and drinking,doing drugs etc. This is what I like and what I want but don't dare to. This question is not Colombia specific, I'm asking about all countries that wouldn't be considered ""very safe"", so even countries in SEA like Vietnam or Thailand.   


So, how do you guys do it? Maybe I'm too cautious since I avoid many situations even during daytime while alone exploring. But then again, I don't want to get robbed or worse, injured in any way.

What's the most affordable city you've been to with the best amenities for everyday living?,"For me it would have to be Medellin. You could take the metro and cable car everywhere and Uber is dirt cheap. Airbnb's are plentiful and you can find nice rooms for 200 a month or sometimes even less. Restaurants give great discounts with their ""menu del dia"" options which helps cut costs even more. On top of this it's a beautiful city with great nightlifte, etc. So far it's been difficult for me to find places that compare. 

When things calm down I was thinking of returning to Medellin for a while to work remotely, but at the same time I'd like to explore other areas. I still haven't gotten the chance to venture out to Eastern Europe and SEA, which are next on my list.

Greece May 2021 questions,"Seeking feedback on a planned solo trip to Greece 2021, COVID situation dependent.

I’m primarily interested in hiking/exploring with bars and music at night. Beaches are nice, but swimming not a focus on this one. 

I’m date flexible, but trying to balance good weather (not a fan of overcast) and meeting other travelers with beating the stampede. 

Tentative schedule

May 4/5th: USA -&gt; Athens (get in 10pm)

May 6th or 7th: -&gt; Rhodes

(Possible ferry to Fethiye/Bodrum In here)

May 12th: -&gt; Crete

May 16th: -&gt; Athens

May 17th: Delphi day trip

May 18th: -&gt; USA 

# Date questions 

1. Is this too early weather wise? I’m under the impression that Rhodes especially, but also Crete will likely have sunny weather, and great temp for hikes. But would bumping to mid/end of May be wise? 
2. Likewise, from a seasonal perspective. I know COVID adds uncertainty here, but should stuff mostly be open by early May? Will anyone be around? As a solo, I certainly don’t want to be in a ghost town.

# Crete vs Paros/Naxos 
My first choice is probably Paros/Naxos instead of Crete since it’s so huge and intimidating with the limited time I have. I also like being able to day trip from Paros to Naxos for hiking (and possibly Santorini). However, I’m under the impression Crate should be much more active by early May than Paros/Naxos and much easier to get to from Rhodes. Is this likely the case? Is it worth pushing to mid/end May and switch to Paros?

# Turkey
Is it worth making time to hit Fethiye or Bodrum from Rhodes? Especially if I can extend the trip by a few days? I’d really like to do it, assuming the ferries will be running at that time, and it won’t be a headache. 

I’ve been reading a ton of info online about solo traveling Greece, but I’d love any advice anyone can give about where and when to go. And tips for Solo in the Greece islands.

"I'm lost. I want to live abroad but I don't know if it's possible or where to start. Just kind of poured my thoughts out and would appreciate insight or advice. Not sure where to ask so I just posted here, sorry if it doesn't belong.","*Preface as to where I'm at with school and how I feel about jobs-* 

I’m a junior in high school and coming to terms with the fact that I have an entire life ahead of me independent from my parents. I have to make something of my life. I have to find fulfillment and happiness, and at the same time be self sufficient. There are an inconceivable amount of possibilities yet I have to hone down on a singular path. I have to take a first step and I don’t exactly know what it should be. 

School has been a mess and I have absolutely zero passion or interest in any class I’ve taken. I suppose some aspects of literature and history have been interesting here and there, but the work revolving around anything related to school is so draining. It’s incredibly hard to motivate myself to do homework or to study and I can’t imagine pursuing an actual career related to the subjects I’ve stumbled across. The thought of being rooted in one place pursuing some career in whatever field my college degree happens to be in sounds horrible. 

There’s something about tasks that require lots of thinking where I’m expected to meet a deadline that doesn’t click with me. Writing essays, studying calculus, reading about cellular respiration, and anything in between is incredibly hard. I just can’t focus on it. I have a much easier, relaxing time doing mundane, physical tasks like mowing a lawn or stocking shelves than I do complex tasks that require deeper thought. Maybe it’s like this for everyone, but I guess I don’t have the stamina or willpower for it. It’s too hard and too stressful. If I’m going to have to work to make money I’d rather it be something easy than it be something hard. 

I’m content with the thought of working a low paying, low skill job for the rest of my life. I feel it's wishful thinking to believe there’s a sizable chance I’ll find a job that I enjoy doing, and I’m sure most people end up not liking the job they get stuck with. Might as well cut my losses rather than try to grasp at something that’s not there. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Travel related part-*

This leads me to my issue. There is an abundance of trades that pay relatively well, or even just jobs managing the local walmart or whatever, but anything in the states just sounds boring and depressing. Living in the same town for years on end is boring. The world genuinely interests me and I want to explore it. I want to travel, and not the sight-seeing vacation type, but just experience everything. I wanna be able to settle down in any old European town and live there until I grow bored of it and wish to seek a new culture or landscape. I don’t care for the materialistic side of things like having a nice home or nice cars. As long as I have my basic necessities covered and I’m not homeless I’m sure I’ll be fine. 

The problem is I don’t know if it’s possible to pick up jobs in foreign countries, especially if I’m not fluent in the language. I don’t know if I’ll just be able to show up in a city and find employment relatively quickly. Maybe I will need to settle down someplace in the states and work to save money by living below my means so that I can afford to travel the world X amount of months out of every year. 

It’s so overwhelming and I’m having trouble articulating my thoughts. I really do just want to go out and explore the world, live my life in the moment. I don’t want to be tied down with a family driving my kids to soccer every weekend, working my 9-5 so that I can pay the mortgage on my house in the suburb and put food on the table. I’m just scared I’m gonna graduate and go move to Europe with 10,000 dollars in my bank account, stay for a month unable to find employment and end up on the streets with nowhere to go. Maybe I should get a college degree so I have something to default on. I just want to live this nomadic lifestyle and experience what there is to experience, but I don’t know where to start. I don’t even know if it’s possible. I’m not even sure this entire rant even makes sense, but I’d appreciate any advice or insight.",solotravel,imadrowninmysorrows

For me, I actually enjoy going for a quick trip during those times, its very quiet as you would expect, but to me its actually nice to walk around and see the sights in peace away from large crowds.

Its ironic as well because I feel the 'Christmas spirit' more so when I am away from home, maybe due to the extremely cold winter and the chance to drink gluhwein or whatever haha.

I'm thinking of actually spending the whole period abroad - obviously not this year but maybe for next NYE and beyond. I normally stay in hostels, wonder if they are empty by new years eve?

Any painters on the road? What's in your bag? Tips?,"I've just recently started to pick up watercolor as a stress relief hobby. I used to paint for fun in school, but stopped over a decade ago--losing all my penmanship and dexterity since I only use my hands for typing these days. I'm just starting to relearn everything, but really liking it so far. 



I like the idea of plein air painting. I love the quiet people-watching moments that solo travel allows, when you have all the time in the world to sit and soak in the ambiance. Usually I just absent-mindedly drink some coffee and leave when I'm done, but I figure plein air painting would be a great way to really appreciate my environment and commit it to memory. There's been so many instances solo traveling where I want to soak in my environment and have an excuse to sit around for an hour lol. 


Does anyone else paint on the road? If so, what are your supplies? Do you have any advice or recommendations? I've bought one of those mini tins that can cram 18 watercolour half pans, but I'm looking for small brushes and other mini equipment that won't take up much space. I'm into minimalist travel, and it'd be great if I could find supplies to fit in small spaces for backpack-less day trips (eg with a small fanny pack or crossbody purse).

Does this look as bad as it looks? Awkward solo travel moment...,"I was on a plane from Tangier to Rome seated next to a very sweet old lady wearing a hijab. She spoke no English, and I speak no Arabic nor Spanish, though between us we made a little headway with our equally shaky French and plenty of friendly gesticulating.

At some point in the flight I realised I smelled very much like a smelly backpacker. So, when I had to go to the bathroom, I took my roll-on with me to freshen up a bit out of consideration for my friendly seatmate. I was in the plane’s toilet cubicle and there wasn’t much left in the roll-on bottle (one of those Nivea ones with the thick gel-liquid-stuff) so I shook it to get it the dregs to go onto the ball.

Horrifyingly, the ball popped off the end of the bottle (which has *never ever* happened to me before) and the fucking deodorant flung out in a slash all over the mirror, basin and my jeans. The deodorant gel was white, not clear, so I started panicking and thinking “I have GOT to get this off my pants.” I tried wiping it with toilet paper but that just pilled and made grains of toilet paper stick to my leg and crotch in an incriminating blotchy white line.

It definitely looked as bad as it looked. I’d been in the bathroom for ages at that point and eventually had to head back to my seat with a long white stain down the groin and left leg of my black skinny jeans. There was nothing discrete about my re-entry and my new friend refused to gesticulate with me for the rest of the trip. Shame – a lost opportunity.

Month long solo UK trip - Summer 2021 - Is this feasible?,"Hey solotravel!

With news of the vaccine being great across the board (so far and fingers crossed), I am starting to look to Europe for a long awaited solo trip. I am specifically planning a trip **around the UK in the June for a little over a month** and I am curious of everybody's thoughts around here on the details of my trip, specifically from a solo traveler perspective because I'll be totally alone for basically all of this and I figure folks around here have done similar trips in the past.

I am an American and I have never been to the UK (only been to Europe once as a high schooler in Italy), so I am a noob across the board. But I really want to see a bunch of stuff. 

**Here's my trip outline:**

* **London** - June 2nd-June 7th (**4 full days** in London, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Liverpool** - June 7th-June 10th (**1 full day** in Liverpool, 1 day trip to Manchester, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Edinburgh** - June 10th-June 15th (**4 full days in Edinburgh**, 1 day trip to Loch Lomond, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Glasgow** - June 16th-June 20th (**3 full days in Glasgow**, two travel days in/out)
* **Belfast** - June 20th-June 23rd (**2 full days in Belfast**, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Dublin** - June 23rd-June 25th (**2 full days in Dublin**, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Birmingham** - June 26th-July 2nd (**3 full days in Birmingham**, 1 day trip to Oxford, 1 day trip to Cambridge, 2 travel days in/out)
* **London** - July 2nd-July 6th (**3 full days in London, 2 travel days in/out)**

When I say travel in/out I basically mean half days where traveling is the priority, so for that first London date I'd be flying in on the 2nd and leaving for Liverpool on the morning of the 7th.

Are there any stops on here that are way too long? I don't need to be go-go-go for every part of this trip, I wouldn't mind relaxing here and there. I tried to build that rest into some of the Birmingham time because I figure I'll be a bit worn out by then, and that town is centrally located and low key so I thought it'd be good for day trips and rest. Again I'm alone so I'm really just into museums and nature and wandering around.

I plan on using trains to get around for the most part, though I have become aware that renting a car may be easier for an American than I originally thought. So we'll see on that!

Does anything stick out as red flags on this trip? I'm really just looking for general thoughts and reactions from seasoned travelers. I appreciate any feedback! Obviously, this is all COVID contingent, so here's hoping that the vaccine distribution is successful across the world.

**EDIT:** Thanks so much for all of the advice so far! It sounds like the consensus is for sure that it is too city heavy right now and that I should lean more towards smaller towns and countrysides. I think I am going to take that to heart for sure. The other advice is that Ireland and Northern Ireland are worth doing separately and I think I am starting to agree with that. Also I'm impressed only one person corrected that Dublin is not in the UK haha, I know that but looking at the map it made for an easy loop around. I understand it's a whole different place though.

I'm starting to think that I will reduce the number of nights in the cities and do some research on specific spots across the mainland that would be a bit smaller/more nature focused. I'm also thinking that if this does go on to be the first leg in a greater European trip, maybe I can round out the trip in Ireland at the end and spend more time outside of its cities.

I really appreciate all of the advice! This has been so helpful so far.",solotravel,l0ngstorySHIRT
[Q] Solo Travel to London UK for medical testing procedures?,"Hi there,

How to you keep from getting exhausted?,"Disclaimer: I'm fairly new to solo traveling, so maybe my experience isn't that common.

On my last trip, I traveled to a city that had so much to see and do that I was *constantly* on the move, every minute of the day.  Because of that, I was exhausted by each evening, and having only a few drinks at the hostel just sent me to bed right as everyone was getting ready to go out or the night was starting.  I felt like I missed out on half the experience of traveling, which is making friendships and connections with fellow travelers.

Learning a Language While Traveling,"Have any of you had any luck learning a language by moving to a new country for about a year? I really want to learn Spanish but my accent doesn’t help and it doesn’t help that the country I live in doesn’t speak Spanish. I’m seriously considering moving to South America for about a year in hopes of learning, but moving alone and not knowing the language feels daunting. I’ve solo traveled countless times but English was known enough in the countries I’ve been to that I’ve been able to get by on that alone. This is also something I’m planning for in the future, hopefully once COVID slows down so I can visit other countries/cities while I’m out there. So any tips on preparing before the move would be helpful as well. I know a good amount of vocabulary but struggle with listening/speaking/sentence structure. I’ve considered Argentina and Chile the most, but am afraid that the big cities I have in mind will still speak a fair amount of English and counter my whole reason for the move. I live in Europe and have considered doing a month or two long course in Spain but honestly think South America would be a better adventure. What do you think?",solotravel,MetMeInTheAfterglow
How I can meet people while solo traveling North America?,"Since March, I haven't left my house. The only people I have had any in-person social interaction with are my immediate family members. I am taking a gap year before beginning college next year. 

I can't leave my house because I have to take care of a parent who has a condition whereby getting COVID can be very dangerous. By April or May I can leave because my dad is gonna come back from abroad. 

I can feel that my social abilities are becoming weaker. I feel awkward even when talking to friends on Zoom.

I was planning to backpack South America around May-July, but I realized that most international borders may still be closed to tourists and there would be many restrictions. Now I am planning to take Amtraks to different parts of North America. I am not planning to camp or do any wilderness related traveling. 

How can I meet people while doing so? Where should I go? What should I do specifically? 

I would like to interact with lots of people so that I can practice social skills, lose any awkwardness I feel now, and regain whatever I lost during this period. 

In Europe or certain parts of South America, hostels are popular which is a good way to interact with people. Is there any equivalent in America?",solotravel,Intrepid-Composer730
Any travelers produce music while backpacking?,"**Curious if anyone has produced music while backpacking (e.g. Ableton)?** What gear did you bring? Did you end up producing at all or just having fun?

When should we be planning for post-covid world travel?,"**Sorry if this has been discussed endlessly already, but search yielded little results.**

With many vaccines about to be distributed, when should we realistically expect to be able to travel freely and enjoy the world unfettered by masks and restrictions? Europe, SE Asia, and South America may have different timelines.

I'm hoping for the best, but planning for the worst. The bankers (Goldman Sachs) announced they believe 70% of the developed world will be vaccinated by fall 2021.

Considering realistic expectations, I'd wager that it's really not until 2022 that we have a return to normal, assuming no surprises. Regionally 2021 will be better for everyone, but international travel may still be restricted, or at a minimum you'd still encounter covid-related obstacles around the world.

I'm reconsidering my plan to quit my job in spring 2021 and travel. May need to wait...

Tried to do a local trip by myself,"I feel like it was a fail cause I ended up chickening out. Basically I booked this Airbnb which wasn’t far from where I live to go hiking by myself. When I got there it was like middle of nowhere and tbh I was immediately uncomfortable because there were a bunch of White supremacists signs on a few peoples homes in the area. But since I already paid for everything i decided to stay. The Airbnb was pretty nice and relaxing with a view of the lake. Then I went out to the hiking trail. I kinda got lost and my car was not suitable for the terrain so I had to leave it. I started walking to the trail it was bright and sunny but a little cold. I did see a few older people on the trail. For some reason I felt really uncomfortable being alone. I just couldn’t do it and turned back. 

I went back to the Airbnb. Basically I ordered food got some wine, watched Home Alone and went to sleep. The next morning I left my trip early and went home. I don’t know why but I just was feeling really sad. I’ve always wanted to do this and it just didn’t work out. I’ve always went on trips with people (family, friends, former partners, etc) this was supposed to be my first solo trip and it just sucked. My anxiety, depression and stuff since my breakup really messed with my head 

I’m gonna try again and research better next time. But anyway, i know this wasn’t really traveling since it was only a short road trip away.

Edit: Thank you to everyone for the support. Really makes me feel better about the whole situation. I forgot to mention the dog at the Airbnb! He was super adorable and a really large dog. It also made my day",solotravel,funguy202

Which big trip should I do first? (SEA or Eastern Europe?),"Hello everyone! 

So, as the vaccine news draws in I’m getting really excited about travel &amp; want to do a long, big solo trip as soon as it’s possible. Im hoping next autumn, like September or October of 2021. I’ve been debating between Southeast Asia or Eastern Europe. I’ve planned both out, but I’m not sure which to do first! Doing them back to back would be great, but I don’t think I would have the money to make it work. 

For SEA im hoping to spend 4-6 months there going through Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, Singapore &amp; Malaysia.

For Eastern Europe I would be hoping to spend 4ish months going through Slovenia, Albania. Croatia, Slovakia, Romania, Greece, Ukraine, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro &amp; Hungary.

Another option would be working as an English teacher in France from Oct 2021-May 2022, then going backpacking from there, but I think I would have a lot less money if I did that, so am kind of considering putting it on the back burner.

Travellers on Capitalism,"I'm a 24 year old male from Canada and I feel as though I have no direction in life. This might not be the right subreddit to talk about this but I feel travelers have a great perspective on life. I'm currently working and the job by all accounts is fine, but I'm starting to get into the 9-5 grind and I'm not excited about the prospect of doing this for the next 40 years. I've been thinking about on moving to a larger city maybe doing a program overseas like JET before COVID, but with it has come a delay which has left me a lot of time for contemplation. 

I have a good career trajectory but I feel as though I've been on the rollercoaster of life without much of my own say in the matter and now here I am. I can continue down this path and live a life of comfort and stability, which I can build upon with family and friends and no doubt will I be happy, as I understand these are luxuries are not provided to all who walk this world but there's still a part of me that yearns for something different. I think this comes from my past of traveling doing three separate solo travel trips. These trips have certainly impacted my life and made me less reliant on physical items for happiness and more on experiences which goes against the capitalist system that we as humans are forced to live within, so I guess my questions lies there. I assume most travellers live with the ideology of experiences over materialism, but how are we to cope with life when reality by all accounts forces us down a path of capitalism and conformity?

Solo Travel while Partnered,"Howdy, everyone. 

Does anyone have any advice for not feeling guilty about traveling solo while you’re partnered?

I discovered solo travel after a manipulative and emotionally abusive relationship, and it’s truly become a part of who I am.  My longest trips have been 3 weeks in Southeast Asia and 4 weeks in Portugal and Spain.  I love seeing the world and connecting with my inner-most self.

I’m lucky to be in a secure and loving relationship, now, and my partner embraces, supports, and actually encourages my solo travel.  It feels weird, to be honest!

(As an aside, we also travel together and I enjoy it, but solo travel is still my favorite.)

Does anyone have any suggestions for combating that guilty feeling?  I feel like I “should” want to travel with him more than I want to travel solo (even though I know this is a cognitive distortion and I’m lucky to have a partner that gets it that solo travel is part of my DNA).

Do most people travel carrying their passport on them at all times. The moment I arrive in a place I immediately lock up my passport in either the hostel storage locker or hotel room I’m staying in. Only time I have it on me is in the airport or crossing borders if needed. I usually just carry my US state ID with me in case I need identification for anything.

Is there a reason people carry it with them at all times that I’m missing? Or should I be carrying it with me at all times?

Help me with my first international solo trip! (Tulum),"Hey everybody! I’m going to be as descriptive as I can about this in the hopes of it not being removed and actually being able to help me out. 

I have my first international solo trip coming up on May 8-16 in Tulum. Fingers crossed the virus is in a much better place by then. 

I am trying to come up with a rough itinerary on things to do and places to stay. 

I will have a rental car the entire 8 days. 

My MAIN question that is killing me, has to do with additional excursions that aren’t the easiest to do. 

I’m trying to decide if I want to take a ferry to Cozumel on my arrival day and spend 1 night there before getting to Tulum. And my second question is do I want to drive all the way down to Punta Allen and do I want to stay a night there? 

If the trip to Cozumel is suggested I was thinking of leaving my rental car in Playa del Carmen and renting a Classic Beetle to drive around the island for the day. 

The type of activities I am looking to do are more adventurous and seeing nature than spending a week on the beach. I will probably spend 1 maybe 2 days on the actually beach. 

Certain things I’m specifically looking at doing are the river float in Sian Ka’an. Going to Cenotes. A group dinner experience. Seeing Mayan ruins. Snorkeling with the sea turtles. 

I’m thinking of staying in a mix of hotels and hostels, this would be my first time ever staying at a hostel.

Social versus safety when traveling?,"I've been reading all these posts about people who go solo travel, meet some cool new people, go out drinking and all that stuff. the question that's been nagging at me throughout my solo traveling experiences is- How do you all balance this with safety? 

I know of somebody who went traveling, made some new friends, went out drinking with them - and woke up in a gutter with all their stuff stolen and had to get an emergency passport back to the US.

Personally when I solo travel, I pretty much have eyes in the back of my head. I do not trust random strangers who are inviting me to go check something out, and don't really care to get inebriated, because if I get drunk and in a bad situation, there's no one to come save me.

Domestic travel vs international travel,"Could we have a discussion comparing the two?

International travel is definitely more ""exotic"". And if I want authenticity for something, I should go to to the host country. 

Domestic travel is cheaper (usually).

Starting van or camper travel late in life?,"Ok, so I’ve never done either. Lots of tent camping as a kid. A few summer road trips sleeping in my car.  I’m planning a cross county trip,this winter. Right now the plan is Motel 6 every night. I’m wondering if I could pull it together to get a vehicle I can sleep in.  I plan to be on the road or visiting family for at least a month, so having a portable place to sleep is appealing to me. Weighing the cost of a used van/ camper and its gasoline vs hotels every night. My issue is really not so much the cost so much as Can I do it? I’m middle aged, short, not especially strong. Don’t think I manage a DIY van conversion. I think about struggling to hitch a camper to a tow. I think about a driveable RV, no towing. But that could lead to auto repair issues on the road. Please any experiences with buying and using a van or camper, what to shop,for, pitfalls to avoid.  Thanks.",solotravel,ZestycloseWeekend878
Your dumbest mistake while solotravelling?,"While we shouldn't be out travelling during the pandemic so what's there to do other than sharing our brainbloopers and learning from them perhaps.


I've shared this mistake in another thread with similar theme, but oh what a costly error of thinking. 

I was finally travelling home from Southeast Asia after spending a month in Vietnam. I didn't book a flight home as I had no specific deadline other than a loosely set date. 


Browsed the web on my phone, found a reasonable price - a bit late in the night 00:10, but to save money I'm no stranger to travelling late, can even sleep on the flight so not even a bad choice after all.


So here's the fuck up, I booked the flight home for 25th of June, 00:10. Not optimal with checkout times but I figured I would just travel a day early to get closer to the airport, check into a cheap hostel. So I did, checked out from the hotel and booked a taxi to the hostel. Had a day to rest out and do literally nothing. I arrived at the airport the 25th of June around 21:50, ready for a long flight.


Made my way to the lists of flights and gates that's continously updated. Stood there like a dumb fuck staring, looking for my flight for atleast 5 minutes. Waiting to see if the rolling list was just playing a trick on my mind, making me miss my specific flight.


Eventually when looking down at my phone and checking my flight reservation I realized I had missed my fucking flight. It's about to hit 26th of June 00:10. Not only did I miss it, but I missed it by an entire day.


After sighing internally and declaring myself dumb for another solid 5 minute which felt like an hour I quickly began looking up new flights. Instead of paying 550 euros back home I'm now paying 700 euro, and not until the day after. But I'm a belief of the you live and you learn, plus I'm not by any means rich but I'm not poor either so I always budget for major fucks up like this even if it did sting like a bitch.


**tl:dr** Booked flight for 25th of June 00:10, thought this meant I could go to the airport the 25hth of June close to midnight and make my flight but obviously it's about to be 26th of June.

Taking a pet with you while going abroad,"Hi! I'm a senior in college and I recently found a stray cat and really want to keep him. The only thing stopping me is that I'm hoping to take a gap year abroad next year (specifically I applied to a program in Spain). I'm not planning on traveling to a new country every week or anything, I would have a full time job in Spain, but I would likely take weekend trips or maybe the occasional one week trip somewhere. I would take him abroad with me if possible but I'm not sure how complicated that is. Has anyone done this, and what was your experience like? Was it difficult for you and your pet to travel and adjust to a new country or was it relatively simple? Would you recommend someone taking their pet with them?

I really love this cat and if I was going to grad school or getting a full time job next year I would keep him for sure. I don't want to give him up just because I might go abroad for a year, so hearing other people's experiences would be super helpful. Thanks!",solotravel,WholePhotograph
"Footwear for Central Asia, Caucasus","Hi all,

As the title suggests, I’m planning a trip to Central Asia and the Caucasus for the future.

As I would be in the regions in spring, from March - June, that precipitates the need for good footwear. I have a pair of Eccos for walking and cities, but need a second option. 

Deciding between a hiking shoe, trail runner, and sneaker. Obviously all have their own plaudits, but my main concern is use outside of the mountains and grinding down the logs on asphalt or concrete. That said, if much of the land is going to be gravel, mud, or glass, it would be better to have more stable footwear.

You have no CLUE what to expect, which is exciting! I kind of feel like if I do a lot of research, I'm watching the end of the movie and then when I get there is start the movie from the beginning.

I roll up to the hostel and say tell me what to do, give me some tips, what's your favorite spots, and then from there ask them where I should head to next.

Yes, this does end up being more expensive, a harder learning experience....but that's the fun in it. Those tips on ""10 things I wish I knew before going \_\_\_\_\_\_"" nope I skip out on. I learn the hard way, and those bumps in the road make it more memorable.

"The pandemic is kind of like a travel ""tolerance break"". Anyone else feel they got an interestingly positive perspective reset?","Well here's my rant for the month, not really a question. I fucking hate this pandemic, and I hate being stuck domestic, but there's a tiny silver lining for me anyway. 

About a year ago,  I took my first solo trip and never looked back on whether or not I'd like the idea. I was less than a year into really moving on from domestic travel (been to most cool cities in the US) to primarily going abroad. I did as many countries in 2019 as I had in my life prior. I had a cushy remote job, which meant workations on top of good salary and paid vacations. 

Then 2 days before I am supposed to leave for Colombia, borders shut down. 

Slowly but surely I started forgetting (or becoming a bit numb to) what I loved about travel and why, I got used to not seeing and hopping on flight deals I find just because. The unknowns of solo travel started to be nerve wracking again when I contemplated future trips. 

**But.** 

Distance does make the heart grow fonder. As I look at my potential future journeys, I'm looking upon them less methodically, with a fresh set of eyes, a new sense of adventure, and in a way rediscovering why I want to see the world. 

It's not often that I get to reset that bewilderment and innocence of doing something new that I end up loving; the pandemic hitting right as I started to become semi-nomadic did give me a minute to evaluate and experience that again. It is kind of a cool feeling, to be honest. 

But also, still, fuck this pandemic.",solotravel,jtrom1010

IMDB does this for movies, and Goodreads does this for books. It's very helpful in deciding what to watch or read.

Is it still possible to travel from continent to continent by cargo ship?,"Reading the books of such authors as Jack Kerouac or Gary Snyder (two huge solo-travel heroes of mine) it seems that traveling from, say, Europe to India by cargo ship is an incredibly cool way to do it. You have days and weeks all for yourself, all that ocean around you, time to think and reflect etc. 

So now I am wondering: Is it nowadays still possible to kind of ""hop"" on a cargo ship? Not illegally I mean - and also not through sites like this one [https://www.cargoshipvoyages.com/](https://www.cargoshipvoyages.com/), where you have to pay 3.000 dollars or more.  
I am looking for something very basic and affordable. I don't need a nice cabin, I am happy to sleep in a dorm with the sailors, for example.  
Also I guess that in these days of highly optimized crews, it is not possible anymore to just show up by the docks and offer to peel potatoes in exchange for a trip from Port Said to Hong Kong, like you could do 50 years ago.

Feeling like there are so many places to go and not enough time,"This thread is just to get these feelings off my chest, there's no real question or point.

I love making lists of places I want to go. I love creating rough plans, writing down all the activies I want to do and the cities I want to see. I think about the food I want to eat. Maybe I'll do a workaway on a vineyard. Maybe I'll get scuba certified or do a silent meditation retreat. I love art museums. There are so many hikes around the world I want to do, I would love to go to every national park (I live in the US). Most of the individual trips would be 3 weeks to a month minimum to really immerse myself and do all these things that I want to do.

I get a rush when making these lists but then after I feel kinda sad. I'm turning 27 tomorrow, it's like time slips by so fast. Obviously with COVID I couldn't travel out of the country even if I wanted to, but still. I feel the pressure to constantly work. Will I ever have that amount of time off, what are the chances of it being every year? I wish I had started traveling when I was younger when I had summers off.

Solo U.S.A. Minivan woman traveler - looking for courage / advice,"Hello! I’m new to reddit and enjoying this sub, looking for courage and advice for the next step of my heavy solo traveling life.

I’ve travelled solo since I was 21, when I went 3 weeks early to my London study abroad semester and booked a 2 wk UK tour with strangers...followed by solo trips to Ireland and Scotland, and a partly solo 5 country European tour in 9 days (lots of alone time, traveling w two near-strangers, did all the planning/routes, mainly using Rick Steve’s’ Europe Through The Back Door :). 

(Actually my FIRST time w solo travel was on a plane at 12, to Boston / Lake Winnepesaukee NH, to visit my best friend...wow just remembered that :)

Since then I’ve toured and travelled solo most my life, moved to NYC for 2 years for grad school and would take impulsive trips to Montauk or back to Chicago (near where I’m from originally), etc, joined a touring children’s theatre for 2 years and ran off on solo excursions with the van sometimes, and now, I’m a spontaneous singer-songwriter, taking nature drives and ‘songwriting adventure’ trips every month (mostly in nature since covid), and before covid, was booking frequent 4-6 day solo Midwest tours. Sometimes to based around where family lived, sometimes with strangers to play DIY basement / attic shows, developing new friendships and sleeping there, and sometimes just to get away completely solo and write songs in new places (changes in perspective help me), and in those cases, booking motel rooms or Air BnBs.

But I’m at a huge turning point and could use a pep talk lol...bought a minivan last year for touring (Sienna LE, tinted windows) and I teach piano lessons for income and currently they are all virtual and I might keep it that way permanently going forward...so I realized I could afford to travel solo a LOT more often in the future (post-covid), if I SLEPT in it! 

So far I haven’t done it, I’ve heard you can park overnight in Walmart parking lots...but I’m a little concerned about bathrooms and safety.

I’m 4’11 so comfort isn’t an issue, I’ll fit no problem...and I slept on floors on tour anyway. It’s more that I have a history of some sexual trauma so I’m less adventurous than I was around possibly unsafe things...like I wouldn’t do mixed dorms in hostels now, for instance. I’m also not sure how I’d feel parking in a secluded place...like rest stops in rural areas. BUT I dumped way too much money into cheap motels on my last cross-country trip, and I don’t want that to deter my *hopeful* (covid-wise) late 2021 adventures, sooooo...

Do you have experience sleeping in vans or RVs, parking in unconventional places? Any advice for bathrooms or safety? Any weird or bad experiences to share, with this solitary sleep-in-vehicle approach to adventure and travel?

Puerto Escondido vs Puerto Vallarta For Solo Traveler?,"Hey all,

I planned a trip to Mexico for Mid-December. I have a choice between going to Puerto Escondido or Puerto Vallarta for 7 days.

All I'm looking to do is Wake up &amp; Surf, Work from the Hostel (all I need is wifi), Eat good food (maybe cook since I like to do that) and maybe go to a few bars/restaurants/walk around the city while wearing a mask of course! I'm NOT looking to do any tours, like ziplining or rafting, nothing crazy. I'd also like to go hiking (I love waterfalls) on my day off if possible. But really surfing, food, culture and being in warm weather while I work are the reasons I'm going.

A few more details:

1. I'm a beginner/intermediate surfer, I've done a few group lessons and can stand on my own if the waves aren't too crazy. Still learning to go left/right. I'm not sure if Puerto Escondido or Puerto Vallarta is better for my skill level.
2. I've already booked a hostel at each location (I get a full refund if I cancel). The Puerto Escondido Hostel is right on Playa Zicatela while the Puerto Vallarta Hostel is a 2 min walk to Rosita Beach
3. I don't plan on renting a car, but wouldn't mind renting one for a day to go hiking in Oaxaca or up/down the Pacific coast from puerto Vallarta on my day off.
4. I have a wifi extender that I can plug into an outlet to (hopefully) increase the wifi connection. I don't have a problem working in common areas of the hostel, and I work essentially 9a-5p.

Ukraine 2020,"I wanted to share my experience traveling to Ukraine.  

I choose the country because it was open to international travelers and it was somewhere that I wouldn't normally consider.  There is an obvious language barrier.  At least in most other places in Europe they use a Latin alphabet which makes things easy.  I found that most young people spoke passible English. There is always Google Translate.  

Ukraine had resisted COVID related restrictions and just recently started to require that businesses close down at 10pm.  Some establishments are closed not because of COVID specifically but because of the economic impact of the virus on consumer spending.  

For obvious reasons the summer is the best time to visit the country.  The sunny weather allows for activities on the beach of the river Dnieper/Dnipro.  I arrived for only a couple weeks of mild weather before things got chilly.  

I got by well with a heavy thermal base layer and a sweater.  Then I bought a packable puffer jacket on Amazon.  The combo works well.  The alternative would be to invest in a fancy CanadaGoose style jacket.  Being from a warm climate I did not think that be a wise investment since I wouldn't get much use out of the heavy coat.  

Kyiv and Lviv are amazing cities.  Kyiv is the capital and the nexus of the country's airline network.  Lviv is a quaint city with a very European atmosphere.  A lot of locals think of Lviv as boring since it is such a small area but I found it to be very walkable. You can get to most places in the city center within a 15 walk.  

Uber in Ukraine is cheap.  My most expensive fare was $13 for 50 minute trip from the airport in Kyiv.  Before the advent of Uber I had previously spent $100 to get to the airport in some N. American cities.

There are plenty of excellent restaurant options in both Kyiv and Lviv.  Tinder dates are the best way to experience the dining scene.  Because of logistical complications seafood in Ukraine tends to be subpar.  I think when you freeze a good tuna steak it tends to loose a lot of flavor.  Also there is a peculiar Ukrainian style of putting cream cheese on sushi.  They often call it a Philadelphia roll.  I prefer my sushi with just sashimi and rice, but that is the local take on sushi.  

I prefer to engage with the locals rather than expats you find in the popular tourist places.  I told my dinner date how she spoke English very well.  She smiled and reminded me that ""English is an international language and you do not own it.""  I thought that was a very succinct way of putting it.  The people I meet in Ukraine where pleasant and made for interesting conversation.   

The thing I disliked about Ukraine is that you are unable to drink water from the tap.  Have you ever been stupid hungover from a night of heavy vodka drinking only to find yourself without any water.  It is a real hassle to have to lace up your boots and layer up with many articles of clothing only to stumble to the store and buy a few liters of water.  

I am glad that I travelled to Ukraine.  I would not normally consider it as a tourist destination.  I have heard good things about Georgia from many of the locals.  I am now considering flights to Tiblisi when their borders open.",solotravel,ATX-SD

Now it's that time and covid has made me confused. I still am itching for an adventure, but I my thoughts are all over the place. Some days, I'm thinking I'll stay home and do stuff locally until a vaccine comes around, other days I'm thinking this is lame and I can't just wait around.

Chiapas/Yucatan 9 Day Itinerary - Doing too much?,"I'm planning a 9 day trip to Chiapas and the Yucatan. I'm wondering if there is too little time here to do either one well. Here's what I have planned:

Day 1 - Fly into Tuxtla Gutierrez. Stay the night in San Cristobal

Day 2 - San Cristobal

Day 3 - Yaxchilan/Bonampak

Day 4 - Palenque/Agua Azul

Day 5 - Travel to Valladolid - basically burning a day here

Day 6 - Hit a cenote, Ek Balam

Day 7 - Open/Flexible day

Day 8 - Isla Holbox beach bum

Day 9 - Isla Holbox beach bum

Day 10 - Isla Holbox beach bum

Day 11 - Fly back out of Cancun

Here are my concerns:

1. I'm trying to do too much and it won't be enjoyable
2. Lots of travel time between Chiapas and the Yucatan
3. If I rent a car to get around, it will be extremely expensive to rent in Tuxtla and drop it in Cancun

Here was my thinking:

1. I am very attracted to Chiapas for the jungle atmosphere. Maybe I'm glorifying it, but it sounds a bit more ""adventury""

Is the remote Pacific worthwhile as a travel destination?,"Like countries like Nauru, Palau, Micronesia, Marshall Islands, etc.

I've never been to the Pacific, and I think it would be neat to visit several countries in the region. I've heard some people say that it's an unforgettable and one of a kind experience to visit these nations, and others have said it was just too expensive, boring, and that they would have rather been to Fiji, Bora Bora, Hawaii, etc instead.

These nations are some of the least visited in the world, so this may be a long shot, but does anyone have any experiences/thoughts on these places? Would you visit them again? Or should I stick to a more mainstream destination for my first time in the pacific?",solotravel,UnRenardRouge
Random sad/crazy story,"I met a few people in Mexico and we all explored Tulum, Mexico together in my rental car.  

I left but stayed in contact with everyone through Instagram.  

When I got back to the airport my cars battery was dead, then I finally got home to find my plumbing was backing up into my sinks and shower! 

A friend messaged me seeing if I made it home alright and I explained all the stuff that happened once I arrived home and said “I feel like something really bad is gonna happen now”.  Kind of joking but had a weird feeling my “bad” night wasn’t over.  

Then one of the guys I met messaged me and said “Richie just died” Richie was another person we traveled around with.  

They went onto the roof to stargaze and one section of the roof was only plaster, the section was over the 4 flights of stairs.  Richie stepped on this section and ended up falling through.  

Richie was a very genuine and cool guy to talk to and be around.

I am thinking in take 1-3 years travelling,"Hello guys, i am thinking in travel around the world in may-jun of the next year IF the vaccine and covid are getting better. I don't know for how long my travel will be. This is part of my doubts.

I am an asian male of 25 years born and raised in Brazil.I work as a doctor and everyone says to me that i need to do my residency first ( specialize to be a cardiologist, neuro, intensivist, whatever ...) that will take me another 3 or 5 years of my life. But i am afraid of getting to old and lose part of the magic of travelling. I know that i'm still young, but i remember when i was 18 and every travel, party or food was more magic that its today.  

I am planning to stay the majority of my time in south east asia end eastearn europe because of the cost of living. I don't know much about east europe , do you guys think it's gonna be safe for asians  to travel there after covid ?  But i want to travel to other places to like china, korea, india, israel, morroco, libanon, egypty,  new zealand, australia, USA and Canada . South america i already traveled to some places and i can always go to a quicky travel of 2 weeks because of the proximity with Brazil. 

If i make  that travel this gonna blow my economies, because our money its worthing nothing in dollars right now. . But i think that our life time has no price. Do you guys think its possible to work in places like australia , new zealand , USA or europe ? ( not as a doctor, but in farms, restaurants, hostels ... )

To the others doctor in the community, do you guys think i am crazy to leave everything behind for 1 or 3 years just to travel  ?   I don't think i will have other oportunity like this in a long time. Who know if i gonna be married with kid in 5 years or become sick or another millions of thinks that can stop me from travel for so long.  

But remember when i return i will need to take my exams, study a lot to pass in the exams and if i pass i gonna need to work 60- 90 hours for week receiving 500 dollars per month as resident doctor for more 3-5 years being older and with all my friends in other stages in life . ( Yeah we receive very little in those years).

I'm sitting at the airport alone. Suddenly feeling really self conscious. Help!,"Let me begin by saying I haven't traveled anywhere in over a year. I've been working a lot and getting burnt out and felt like I ""needed to getaway"".

Last week I put in for some time off and booked a flight to Cancun. I told my dad and he was a little disappointed about my decision because of the whole covid situation. 

I told him my itinerary and that he can call me anytime. He told me to enjoy my trip. 

So I'm at the train station and I see this older couple in their late 50s having trouble navigating their way with the signs. 

They asked me which was the train going to the airport. I told them I was going there too. It turns out they're on the same flight as me. 

They said they wanted to follow my lead and we talk on the train for a bit on our way there. We get there and check in. I was still getting my ticket and they said they would go to the gate first. 

I said I'd meet them there. I get my ticket and get past the gates. I decide to get something to eat. I see them at the next table but I didn't want to intrude. I just wave and we say hi. 

Afterward, I go and sit near the gate when all of a sudden it hits me - I'm all by myself. 

Now I've always traveled alone. I've been close to 20 countries all alone. I've never felt so self conscious as I do right now. 

It's like you feel lonely and desperate for some type of companionship. 

I'm sure I'll meet some awesome people at my hostel like I always do but as for right now, holy shit. 

This sucks. Maybe I jumped the gun. Maybe I shouldn't have booked this trip.

"Any advice, suggestion, or tips for a solo female traveler in Europe?","Hello, I’m 24F and I’m planning to tour around Europe when this pandemic is over. I have always dreamed of traveling to Europe alone (because honestly, I want to have a soul-searching/finding-myself experience). The past two years have been very difficult for me as I have experienced big changes in my life: being diagnosed with depression and anxiety, leaving law school, and ending a relationship—all of which led me to believe that I truly need and deserve to travel for myself and by myself.

Hence, I’m asking for advice, suggestions, and tips on how I can make this trip to Europe fun, safe, and worthwhile.

Experiences of Black women traveling solo in Italy,"My first solo trip was a couple years back. I spent three weeks in Europe and travelled mostly in France and Italy. I loved Paris. Now, I'm a black woman and my friends had told me Italy was amazing, specifically the larger cities. I actually expected more racism in Paris by reputation, but I never had one bad experience there. I travelled by train from Paris to Milan and that was the start of the longest ten days of my life. It was a NIGHTMARE. Seeing as this was my first solo trip and I knew nothing, I had two huge suitcases. I get off the Metro at Duomo, knowing I could get a taxi to my nearby Air BNB. Massive mistake. It was July, the sun was beating down full force and empty taxi after empty taxi passed me by as I was flagging them down. At first, I chalked it up to the size of my bags, my youth, anything and everything. After close to an hour,  I even left my bags in an alcove so I could just jump in front of the next empty taxi I saw and make them take me. (I was standing in front of a traffic light, so they had to stop). I was ignored and batted away.  Finally, a kind trans person came out of a local business and called me a private taxi. That's the service I used the rest of my time in Milan, I never could get a cab just by hailing there. And I didn't have phone service so I couldn't use Uber or Lyft. I've never been so aware of my color in all my life. I'm a 450 in Fenty, cocoa girl and I had long faux locs for traveling convenience. I was staying in a residential area of Milan and people would literally stare at me when I walked down the street. 

A lot of it was racism but some of it was xenophobia against the African immigrants there. When I wore any kind of American paraphernalia I was treated WAYYYYYYY better. I moved onto Rome quickly. It was better but still awful. I'll just never know what percentage was racial. One night, I went to a ballet at La Scala and bumped into some white American tourists. And they told me about how badly they were treated as tourists! Some of what they said sounded very familiar. That leg of trip wasn't all bad. I did some great shopping, had the best gelato ever, saw the Vatican, enjoyed the Eternal City. But I don't know if I'll ever go back, not even for Venice or Naples. I felt so isolated and unsafe. Has anyone experienced this? Any suggestions?

UPDATE: Wow! I did not expect such a response. I really appreciate everyone’s feedback. Everyone who explained Milan’s taxi situation, you helped me see the whole experience from a different angle. I was in Paris for two weeks before I went to Milan, and I hailed cabs all the time-but I was also right down the street from the Luxembourg Gardens, so I’m sure there were an abundance to be had. I stayed in Trastevere in Rome, so I could walk a lot or take trams and buses. And when I would come home from attractions, I would automatically use the taxi stands, so I never really put any of that together before about the taxis in Milan. I’d always wanted to go to Italy so badly and I was disappointed when I did. So I’m grateful to everyone who suggested ways I could take back the experience or navigate similar situations more safely. I’m glad I posted here. The experience was always such a weight on me. I never talked about it with my family because they hadn’t wanted me traveling solo anyway and I didn’t want to give them any ammunition. I feel like I could give Italy a second chance now, but even if I never do, I feel cleansed of the original experience. Now that I’ve talked out the negative, I can just remember the positive, those beautiful sunsets, those lovely narrow streets, and the best gelato I’ve ever had.

Experience as a white guy in Colombia,"So for background: I’m a tall (6’4) German/Nordic looking white dude (If you want, you can see photos in my post history lol)    

Currently in Colombia for a month-long vacation. My experience in Bogotá has been completely awesome, cheap excellent food, interesting culture, so much to see and do..  

That being said, the amount of staring I get is crazy!   
I’m talking almost everybody I pass. At the very least, I get a curious glance, but more often than not it’s a full on, stop what they’re doing and stare situation. I should add it’s not unpleasant or hostile staring. More like very curious looks.    

I get it, I’m white, blondish and tall in a country of darker skin tones, black hair and (for the most part) shorter folks.

On the difficulty of crossing busy roads without cross-walks,"I have been pondering, as I have been watching travel videos and planning lovely future-tense vacations, where the hardest places to simply cross the road are?

**Nothing brings me more stress than a difficult-to-cross road.** It was a deal-breaker for me in much of Vietnam, as I stood, my entire body hairs upright, bracing to cross several times a day for three weeks, and I would find my nervous system so aggravated by just trying to cross the road that I would spend my nights inside in defeat. I was in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Hue, Hoi An, and Can Tho, and other than Hoi An, every city was terrifying to cross at many intersections. Fastforward to Phnom Penh, and I loved it, in retrospect I think because I walked the corniche so often, although I once found myself again unable to cross a sea of motorcycles again at rush hour and wound up finally biding time in a store for an hour because I could not figure out how to cross the street -- even with locals -- without having a sort of sense of nervous collapse.

I have been to Istanbul, a city of 20 million or so, and walked across a freeway once when lost, and did not feel at all anxious. So it's not only the number of people out, but also, how they drive.

Since we can reflect now, and it has come to mind as I watch videos of Cairo, where it looks like Ho Chi Minh City all over again but cars, I find myself thinking, ""I don't want to ever go there"" or ""I'd go straight to Luxor, which could not be that bad! Nothing could be THAT bad, right?"" I'd probably stay in Giza and ask if I could ride a camel to the pyramids and sphinx, from the hotel, lol!

**I'm curious about three things now:**

* 1.) does anyone else just sometimes avoid traveling to places where they feel anxious about being run-over while crossing the street, not because they have unreasonable anxiety issues but because it's just hard? Do you find it kind of wrecks your whole day and you wind up trying to take cabs (that's what I did in Vietnam, and I am not a big fan of cabs for short distances -- I love walking the city streets!)
* 2.) Where does the good people of this subreddit think the world's hardest cities to just cross the streets are, based on personal experience, and why?
* 3.) (Optional) -- for anyone who has been to either Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi (or similar) --AND--  Cairo, or any other Egyptian cities, how did they compare? That's a kind of passing curiosity now.

Thanks for your replies! Seeking future-chill travel which doesn't make my hair stand on end and leave me curled up in a ball in my guesthouse for the rest of the day after a one-hour excursion. But moreso, I just have not seen it discussed before, and I can't be the only person who thinks of the world in terms of ""streets that seem legit"" and ""streets that scare me completely.""",solotravel,the_latest_greatest

"Trying to figure out transportation in Egypt (ferries, trains). Also, please help with itinerary.","Public transportation in Egypt seems to be quite complicated. I have read that certain trains (or compartments) are accessible only for Egyptian nationals and that as a foreigner, you have to book a more expensive luxury compartment (for example for going from Cairo to Luxor).

The same for ferries. I looked into the one from Hurghada to Sharm, and the price is way more expensive for tourists. 

Is there any way to avoid these restrictions and get normal train (and maybe ferry) tickets in Egypt? Is just buying the ticket once you are already on the train a viable option?

I wan to see the following places: 

- Cairo
- Luxor
- Aswan
- Dahab
- Mt. Sinai
- Maybe Alexandria 
- Maybe Abu Simpel

I am flying either into Hurghada or Sharm. If it is the latter, I guess it would be a good idea to start my trip in Dahab and spend one or two weeks there. But actually, I wanted to save Dahab for last, because otherwise I fear I might get ""stuck"" there and spend my whole month there lol.

So my question is this: How can I get from Hurghada to Cairo the cheapest way possible? I have looked into it, but couldn't find any options.

&gt; I know about Go-Bus. But is it possible to catch so-called local buses in Egypt, where you just show up at the bus station and get on the next bus to anywhere? Like it works in India, for example...

I don't want to take any flights.

Also, can you recommend any other places worth seeing in Egypt? I want to avoid resort towns like Sharm. I am interested in Ancient Egyptian History, Islamic history, laid-back places like Dahab...

29M from Canada here looking for a bit of advice or perspective. At the beginning of 2020 I got my 2 year tier 5 yms visa for the UK (valid until January 2022) with the plan to spend the next year or 2 traveling around the uk, working odd jobs and whatnot to support myself. Pretty standard I think. I flew over at the beginning of February and spent about a month there before COVID shut everything down and I decided to play it safe and come back home. Covid completely shut down my industry (live entertainment) so I've been here for the past few months working customer service jobs and whatnot to try and get some savings back but I feel like I'm kind of just wasting time at the moment, waiting for things to open back up (who isn't though). I'm also having a hard time letting the visa go to waste so I've been thinking of heading back in January/February and trying to make a go of it again for a few months at least or until things start to hopefully open up back home. 

So despite Covid I'm curious if anyone here has any suggestions about things to do or places to see in a Covid uk, considering I imagine most things will remain closed for the majority of this year or until a vaccine becomes more widespread. Big fan of the outdoors and just looking to explore and take in as much culture as I can given the situation. I'll likely start around London but from there who knows, I'm open to going wherever.

I understand this may come off as a bit tone-deaf/privileged given everything going on in the world at the moment but I'm just trying to make the best sense out of my situation and options.

Are there direct routes to Budapest from Belgrade or Belgrade to Zagreb? Where do I find them? Why doesn’t FlixBus work in the Balkans? Serbian Railways offers Budapest to Novi Sad but not Budapest to Belgrade - is Novi Sad worth visiting?

Are there still tourists currently in south east Asia?,"I’m playing out a year long solo backpacking trip and plan to leave in a few months. Since I am going for an extended period of time and my trip is mostly going to be by myself I’m asking if countries like Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, etc. currently have other tourists there right now.

USEFUL TIP WHILE PLANNING A SAFARI TO TANZANIA,"Just thought I could share with youse this information.

One the things you need to know while planning your safari to Tanzania, East Africa is ""Time to travel""

Here is the months breakdown which I thought could be helpful for someone to decide when to travel.

Tanzania Seasons: 

January to February: It is normally dry and hot. It is the calving season for the wildebeests so the  wildebeests will be at Southern part of Serengeti,  Ndutu area. Though February is the only time of the year which is guranteed to see the big herds all together move to South of Serengeti for calving. 
Easier to spot wildlife. 
Good time for birds watching since migratory birds are present.

March, April &amp; May, this is peak of wet season. Grasses becomes green and beautiful. Rains may interfere your trip,  parks are less crowded, low rates applies. Animals including the wildebeests which are famous for migration are more dispersed.

June: It is a transitional period from rain season to dry season. Grassess become green. The wildebeets start moving from Central to North Serengeti. Migration can be seen in the Western corridor of Serengeti until July.

July to October: It is dry season in Tanzania, Mostly sunny. Morning and nights get cold. From August to Sept the great heards of wildebeests and Zebras move from Northern Serengeti to Maasai Mara by crossing Mara River,  Easy to spot animals because grasses will be grazed by hebivores and also most of animals concentrates around waterholes. It is quite crowded around Seronera area in Serengeti. High season rates applies.

November to December: It is short rain season though it is still not bad to come. The grasses becomes green and beautiful.

All in all, there is no bad time to visit Tanzania, Africa beacause each month has it's own uniqueness.",solotravel,glory1812
Being Realistic,"Alright, hear me out, this might be a strange one.

Ever since I've (20f) been 16 and watched Karl Watson's HK2NY, a bit of a desire to start travelling has morphed into a true, full-blown obsession. I've done a mass interrailing trip when I finished school, went around Italy for 3 weeks last year and had planned for Greece this summer but obviously, that didn't go ahead. Anyways this obsession has been completely tempted by fate due to me being a planner so last Christmas I had started planning a trip for 2022 - commencing 20th July to hit the Banana Pancake Trail, Oceania and finishing off in the US with Hawaii, San Fran and LA.

When I tell you I've planned it - I have planned it to an inch of its life (yes, I understand the appeal to not booking things for after a month of the travel you have planned but I mean to go to quite a few events before I hit Bondi Beach on Christmas Day so I have to keep to a schedule in order to do the things I want to do) so I know where I'm going, the dates I'll be there, how I'm getting there, how much it would be to get there, the hostel I'm staying at, how much the hostel would be per night and per stay with a few activities thrown in and what visa sort documents I need to enter every country.

When girls say all they wanna do is marry and have babies, this trip for around 10-11 months is all I want to do - and it's all I need to do as well. However, in this context of COVID-19, I'm trying to remain optimistic but how hopeful would a trip like this be?

Leaving July 2022 and hitting Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and the US.

Would this trip be viable to happen then (we're talking about with all the events going full blast as well, Full Moon Party, Christmas and NYE on Bondi etc.) or will I have to postpone it by a year?

TL;DR: Have planned the entirety of an 11 month trip to SE Asia, Oceania, and US. Would it be responsible/viable/able to go ahead?",solotravel,Ketamine_Crazywhoop
Recommendations for a 4 day trip within the United States,"My dad died earlier this year and I need a getaway.  My one vacation to Austin, TX for a friend's wedding was canceled due to Covid, so I have some flight credits I'd like to use; I would also be cool with a 6 hour max drive to my destination. Looking for recommendations for a 4 day solo trip within the United States (I'm located in NYC). I would like to keep COVID risk down, so I'm thinking maybe somewhere with stuff to do outdoors. Although I'm not very athletic, I'm not afraid of a hike or a lot of walking.

Will hostel/hotel prices be inflated once tourism opens up?,"I understand that returning to normality will be a gradual process. There's not going to be a random magical day sometime next year where every country opens it's borders.

I want to know what people's thoughts are on the hostel prices, once tourism is normal?

I don't really understand economics and business too well, but from what I guess is that if there are more tourists, then the prices will be higher, simply because the hostels will be able to get away with and still have full bookings.

Also, what about flights?",solotravel,treeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
"First Backpacking Trip, Balkans recommendations","Hello! I'm an American college student and I recently signed up to spend the Fall semester of 2021 in Athens (Assuming COVID is somewhat under control by then).

My starting point vaguely is to fly into Prague and travel from there to Vienna and on to Belgrade. I would like to spend the bulk of my time in the Balkans and was looking for suggestions mostly for Serbia and Bulgaria, before traveling from Sofia for Athens. Any suggestions for locations/hostels would be greatly appreciated, I'm primarily interested in seeing some mountains and historical sites, and accessibility by bus or train is a huge plus.

Should I quit my job and travel for a bit after COVID?,"Hi everyone, a bit about me, I am a 26F from the US. I am currently working as an accountant in the federal government level, which means my job is BORINGGGGG and I am craving some excitement out of my life. I just bought my own home and own my car(no car payments). I recently had a whole change of personal life, where I had my heart broken by my ex fiancé and now kind of want to do what I’ve always wanted to do without having someone hold me back and that’s travel for more than just a few weeks. I would like to do it for 3+ months, even a year if I could. I do make decent money, 60k a year and have a really great job. However, I feel like because I don’t have any kids, and am young still, this is the time to do it. I’ve always wanted to but growing up in poverty I’ve always wanted to be stable as well and I’m scared that if I do this, I’ll regress. However, this has always been a dream of mine and I kind of want to bite the bullet. Especially right now with covid, I’ll be able to save up for it and plan it well. I was just wondering if anyone else has done this and had success or the opposite? For my house I’m thinking of just renting it out for a year through property management (I’ve done this before with an investment property). Any advice would be appreciated!

Spent a month traveling the western US with my dog Kingston- Itinerary,"Back in September I asked about secret spots and great backcountry camping sites west of the Mississippi. I’ve got a post trip update of what happened and where I went! [Photos!](https://imgur.com/gallery/xCmmNRF)

Days 1-3 Holly Springs NF, Mississippi

I left home in Indiana to drive straight south to Mississippi, after stopping off at bass pro in Nashville for last minute things. Muggy, buggy, beautiful. Couldn’t light a fire for the life of me with how wet and wild the wood was. Surprised we didn’t end up with ticks after 3 days there, but we spent time hiking along cotton fields and plenty of small lakes. 

Day 4 Driving across Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas

Spent the night along a truck pull off just east of the NM border

Days 5-10 Carson National Forest NM

I only planned for 3 days in Carson, but the landscape kept me there for 5. I stayed in the Valle Vidal region the entire time, hiking to a new spot every night. I was drastically unprepared for how cold the mountains could get but we survived with a few extra layers at night (I forgot to take a pic of Kingston in a sweatshirt but rest assured he was warm and goofy looking). We were surrounded by cattle and elk most of the time, great bear prevention I’m sure. Trout streams popped here and there, and with my trusty fishing license and collapsible pole we had trout for dinner once which was messy and a pain but so delicious. 

Day 11 Driving to Painted Desert, AZ

Spent the night in my car at the Painted Desert after watching the sun go down across the canyon. Dinner was couscous on the gas stove followed by a treacherous walk along the rim taking photos and warning Kingston to not jump into the void for a stick.

Day 12 Driving to the Chaco Canyon

We (I) needed a shower so we stayed in the local Motel 6. 

Day 13 Chaco Canyon and driving to the Grand Canyon
 
Chaco Canyon was mostly closed trail wise but we were able to walk to the archaeological site to see the Petroglyphs and remains of civilization. Continued on to the Grand Canyon where I didn’t have the foresight to request a back country camping permit 6 months in advance so yet another motel 6 in my favorite city so far, Flagstaff!

Night 13 Flagstaff

I am in love with this city. Nestled between two national forests with a bustling night life, it is everything I have dreamed of in terms of settling down. Stopped by 3 different dog friendly breweries, Wanderlust Brewing Co, Hops on Birch, and Mother Load Brewing Co. All three were dog friendly and had incredible brews.

Day 14-15 The Grand Canyon

We spent two days hiking the trails in the Grand Canyon, day one we hiked the south rim and Bright Angel Point. Day two we hiked the Hermit trail to both Santa Maria Spring and Dripping Springs. Beautiful hikes, very steep, and little water. Kingston was a rockstar and carried his own water in his backpack, he deserved the second bed at the motel after both nights. 

Day 16-19 San Juan NF CO (Durango)

San Juan NF was lush and green. We camped for 3 days between Madden Peak, Baldy Peak, and Silver Mountain. The campgrounds were packed tight but we were able to find a secluded point with only a few neighbors. 

Day 20-22 Bonneville Salt Flats and Antelope Island SP, UT

We spent two nights on the salt flats watching motocross and dune buggies in the Knolls recreation area. Before leaving the next day we drove across the GSL to Antelope Island to check out the “water” and saw a few Buffalo and a lot of brine shrimp/salt flies. 

Day 23-25 Teton NF Wyoming

We saw a few key spots in Teton, hiking around Jenny Lake was the precipice. 

Days 26-30 Yellowstone NP, Wyoming

I needed to check this off my bucket list, walked along the Upper Geyser Basin, saw the Mammoth Hot Springs, Fountain Paint Pot, the Grand Prismatic Spring, Old Faithful, and the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. We hiked the Mud Volcano Trail, Waipiti Lake Trailhead, and Seven Mile Hole Trailhead. We were lucky to find a spot to camp within Yellowstone and reserved it for the 3 nights it took to see as much as possible.

After Yellowstone, we drove back home to Indiana through South Dakota, seeing Mount Rushmore, Minnesota and Wisconsin, stopping at a few creameries for cheese and ice cream, and drove straight through Illinois to home. It was an adventure I’d love to do again, and it’s spurred my interest in Van Life and Tiny Home living.",solotravel,georampage

Dealing with loneliness while traveling,"So I have been in Costa Rica solo traveling for about a month now, and the feeling of loneliness is really starting to creep in. I am enjoying the trip and there is nowhere else I would rather be for the next 6 months, but i am finding making friends to be really difficult. I have lived in Costa Rica before when I was little, and I had plenty of friends. But when you are a kid making friends is as easy as just having toys and being a similar age. Now I am 18 and I am finding it very difficult to connect with anyone. The local girls (ticas) are not a fond of white girls, so I am having a hard time meeting girls my age. The boys here (ticos) are very pushy and pretty much are only looking for romance because the stereotype is white girls are rich and easy. I am going to be living predominately in the same town for the 6 months, so I am hoping to make a little bit of a community. But the community is very tight and very cliquey. There are the resort owners, surfers, hippies, expats and the Costa Rican locals, but I don't fit into any of them. So I am just wondering how you guys have dealt with loneliness while traveling before? And if you have any tips on how to speed up the friend making process?",solotravel,emily_adams123

Need advice about touring the West Coast/South West in US,"Hi,

To give some background about myself: I am a brown guy in his late 20s that has been living in the United States for more than 5 years now. Using a throwaway account because my some people irl know what my primary reddit account is and I do not want them reading this post.

Due to the culture and the very abusive environment that I was brought up in, I have never been able to have a lot of meaningful relationships, not in my native country and not since I have moved to the United States, which means that I like to travel alone and I mostly keep to myself. You maybe wondering what that has to do with my post on this sub, but I'm getting to it.

One of the very few people that I can say that truly always had my best interests at their heart and have always supported me to the best of their abilities (and financially supported me when I had to move to the US) lives back in my native country. That person is going through some pretty serious health issues right now and they need someone to support them. I couldn't just leave them to their devices in these tough times, so I have made the very hard decision to move back home to support them. I have already put in my notice at my current job (which ends in 3 weeks), and since I am here on an employment based Visa right now, I have 2 months to leave the US and would ideally like to leave around the New year's day.

I have spent most of my time in the United States working and traveling in the South and the East Coast and I feel that I have explored as many places as I could in these parts of the US, so there are no regrets there. But one significant regret I have is that I've never really had the chance to  explore much of the west coast or the South West (besides a trip to Vegas where I unfortunately spent most of my time on the strip in the Casinos), so I would really like to visit these places before the end of this year. My budget is up to $7000 (for motels and rental cars) but I am not entirely sure on what places I should visit and where I should start and end my trip and where I would stay if I were to make this trip (and how suitable the weather conditions are). I've always found the pics with nothing but the desert on both sides of the road in Nevada and Arizona highly fascinating and have always wanted to drive around on those roads. I also have a motorcycle license and would love to ride on those roads but I am not sure if it is as easy to get a motorcycle rental as it is to get a car rental (and how safe/expensive it would be).

Assuming that I have 4 days off for the Thanksgiving weekend and 3 weeks between the 11th of December - 1st of January, what places would you recommend if I want to travel the West coast and the South West alone? I have heard that the drive from Oregon - California is very beautiful and is adjacent to a beach, so I would like to cover too that if possible. I would also like to make a trip to the Grand Canyon but I don't know if this is the right season for that. I am feeling even more clueless than I would have in normal times due to the pandemic and the potential lockdown in California. So any advice you would have for me that would help me in doing one or more of the following things would be highly appreciated.

1. Ride a Motorcycle/Drive a Car around in Nevada/Arizona desert area
2. Make the beautiful drive from Oregon - California
3. Visit the Grand Canyon
4. Stops at any other national parks/places with amazing views

I apologize for any incorrect assumptions I made in this post. I have mostly relied upon what people have told me and what I found on some blogs to form my opinion about the places I mentioned above, so I could be wrong in some cases. I am not sure if I will get the chance to visit the United States again, so I would like to make the most of what little time I have left here and visit as much of the western part of this country as I can before I leave. Thank you for taking the time to read this far into the post :)

Advice &amp; information for Camino de Santiago pilgrimage,"Hello everyone,

In this post I'm asking your help preparing for my first long term solo travel, as the title says, on the pilgrimage called Camino de Santiago.

"If you were a betting redditor, based off of everything we know with the incoming vaccines, how long it could take for global immunity (enough for travel to be safe again anyway), when would you guess that we'll be able to safely and freely solo travel again?","*tl;dr The title, essentially*

I wanted to discuss with fellow solo travelers who I feel must've had this thought come up. 

Last year I graduated and got a job in January that comes with 2 weeks (80 hours) PTO. As a result I immediately started to plan my next trip for March-April 2021 so I could revisit Japan (and a few other countries) during cherry blossom season. Then Covid hit and destroyed that dream, however I still want to travel the moment Covid is a thing in the past. I'm so starved for traveling that I started willingly started working extra hours during certain holidays (Like Indigenous Peoples' Day) when we would otherwise have off to acquire comp time so I could have 3-3.5 weeks of vacation when Covid ends and really make up for lost time.

Now here's where the question comes from. My job doesn't let me rollover PTO, so as a result I need to take some soon. I made an excel sheet where I put in a planned date to determine how many PTO hours I can use prior to that date to avoid not accumulating PTO but still reach max PTO by the time it's travel time. Example, if I take off 2 days in December, I will max back out around April, and 4 days means I'll max back out in June. Give or take.

As a result I've been doing some kind of pre-planning and guessing on when travel will be back to normal. As wishful thinking as it would be, I don't think March-April would be back to normal (which saddens me as I really want to see the cherry blossoms, but I'm also a hypochondriac so it wouldn't even be a fun trip for that reason), so I currently have put June as my more somewhat realistic date. Of course if that doesn't appear to be the case, I'll just adjust accordingly in regards to my PTO and such.

With that in mind, if you were to make a guess, what month (god forbid year) would you think the world would be ready for risk-free travel again? I'm just curious on what other solo travelers specifically think, because I feel like y'all may better understand the reasons why I'm so starved to travel again. Doing whatever I want, getting away from it all, making new friends, with no responsibility for anyone else but yourself. You could say I'm having withdrawals. My friends generally travel with family and other friends so they don't really understand the sense of pure freedom that I miss so much. 

Thanks in advance!",solotravel,LethalCS
First Solo Trip - Across the US,"Hey guys! I’m (22 F) sure a question along this vein has been asked before, but I wanted to get other people’s opinions. I’m graduating this December and I am planning on moving to Berlin next August for my masters. This gives me a pretty large amount of free time. I’ve saved up quite a bit of money, and wanted to do a road trip across the US before I leave.

My dad is very against it, is saying that a lot of things could go wrong. I’ve traveled a lot around the world but usually with said dad, and I’ve never done a trip by myself.

Solo Travelled Brazil (Oct-Nov 2020),"I went on a 2 Week Trip to Brazil from the US from late October and early November. I plan on describing my experience, tips, how I did concerning security, COVID, my hostel experience, and any other relevant information.

Background information on myself so you can get an idea of who I am:

\- Male, 28 years old, average build but with a NY-resting bitch face and walking speed/gait so I can at times dissuade randoms from talking to me. I have solo travelled previously. FIRST TIME to Brazil and South America

\- English: Native / Spanish: Native / Portuguese: Intermediate-High (obvious accent)

\- Brazil Solo Travel Requirement: I'd say Intermediate-Easy. If you've solo'd to Mexico, Turkey or Egypt, you're more than ready. 

Quick Notes for the TL;DR crew:

\- Would I recommend: Yes. Very much so. Highly recommend. 

\- Currency Conversion: Very good, USD is strong.

\- Places visited: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro

\- COVID: Everywhere I went people were very cautious of their surroundings, nearly everyone used a mask, social distancing was hard in some locations but for the most part noticeable measures were taken. Unfortunately, much like most of Latin America, COVID and its outbreaks is highly correlated with one's socioeconomic status.

\- Safety: I personally believe everything I read previously on reddit and other places were exaggerated. This is not to say that you shouldn’t take the smart skills and tips provided to make the informed and preventative measures. I always placed my iPhone 11 Max Pro (whatever it's called) in my front pocket, or my small should fanny pack thing, always had my money clip in front pocket too. (Regardless of travelling or not, you should always keep your wallet in your front pocket). 

I personally never saw anyone get mugged, or felt threatened; I did see some sketchy teens near the historical areas in São Paulo, but you can spot them from afar and they just give off a vibe that they're up to no good. They're not violent though, they're just skulking around, some are clearly high.  Just keep your eyes peeled for anything sus and always look far ahead to prevent anything, and look like you know where you're going and doing. They know when people aren't from there, but if you look unbothered and stern they won't even approach you. It's a bit easier to keep your distance from people due to COVID. If someone does come up and tries to pitch you a sale or something just politely extend your arm and say ""não obrigado"" (no thanks). 

In Rio I took my phone to the beach despite everyone's caution. I never took it out around the bike lanes, however you can see other Brazilians and locals jog up and down the bike lanes with their lastest phones, airpods and other gadgets. I didn't want to tempt that. I would only take my phone out on the shoreline, always after checking my surroundings. If you get a beach seat and beach umbrella from those beach vendors then you can near-worry-free use your phone and take all the selfies you want. I went to the beach with random hostel people (all Brazilians) and we had no issue whatsoever. We would take turns keeping watch on our stuff. We did ask a large group next to us if they could keep an eye on our stuff, they were very willing and even suggested we move our things into the middle of their friend circle so they could properly watch it. 

&amp;#x200B;

São Paulo: I did all the major touristy things from wikitravel, youtube videos, and random blogs.

\- Hostel: Brazilodge Hostel and Hotel in Vila Mariana. Clean hostel, nice staff. Due to COVID many young Brazilian professionals come and go through there, met many recently graduated professionals. Brazilians are very kind and intrigued to meet new people and especially foreigners. This is an upper middle class neighborhood, very clean, very safe. You can see young ladies walk and talk on their phones without worry, teens biking around with their iWatches, and people at night without a worry. 

\- Metro: Extremely efficient, clean, and very safe. The moment people pass the turnstiles people use their phones without a care in the world, on the platform and on the train itself. If you've been to NY, London or Paris than mastering this metro system will take about a whole 10 minutes. I never used the bus, mostly because I hate busses and also because of COVID. 

\- Tinder: Safe, never met anyone sus or trying to scam you. Love motels in Brazil are amazing. $50 for 12 hours gets you a pool, jacuzzi, waterfall shower and a free meal.

\- Uber: Safe, everyone I met was 4.85+ rating. They recently implemented new measures to stamp out any creeps and to make solo women feel safer and have easier means to report any scumbags. 

\- Restaurants: HIGHLY RECOMMEND: Rodizio de Sushi, omfg best thing ever. Never had a bad food experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Rio: I did take a bit more security measures as most people kept saying it was more dangerous. Honestly the Ipanema area is very safe, much safer than Copacabana in my opinion, but even then I didn't feel like people were being robbed and kidnapped at every corner. Walked around with my phone in my pocket and used it freely inside stores, restaurants and cautiously on the street. 

\- Hostel: Mango Tree Hostel. Toilets and showers could be cleaner, but it's worth the money. Great place to meet other travellers, friendly people, lots of locals, good amount of foreigners despite COVID. The very few other foreigners were also versed travellers. 

\- Beach: Ipanema beach is much better than Copacabana, fewer people, less beach vendors, less randos and sus people. All the beach vendors that do approach are polite and aren't harassing, they just quickly pitch their sale and if you politely say 'no thanks' or look but say you're no interested in the moment they'll be on their way. Don't be dick, they're people just trying to make a living. Be nice to them, they're nice to you so it's the least you can do. Some actually have good stuff. The beach seats and umbrella are about R$30 for both for unlimited amount of time. Settle on price prior to sitting. 

Public Transport: I didn't ride any, the uber's were cheap enough, I did walk around with another American aimlessly throughout the southern part of Rio, no problem whatsoever, pretty chill. 

Safety: I felt as though it was ever so slightly more dodgy than São Paulo but nothing like the fear-mongering that many other places would describe it as. I took my phone everywhere, to the beach, the streets, on the ubers, to the tourist attractions, etc. 

I dislike Copacabana, 100% preferred Ipanema beach, the vibe is different more welcoming less commercial, less tourist trap, more authentic. Also on Ipanema the vendors are more laid back and slightly cheaper. All of Rio is gay friendly, but Ipanema has a ""spot"" for LBGT+ people, they may ask you to watch their stuff, it's kind of rule of thumb to watch other people's stuff as they'll watch your stuff too if you ask, scratch my back I'll scratch yours type of thing. I also felt safer taking my phone our and taking photos on Ipanema. It's more of a gut feeling, and never ignore your gut.

Tinder: A bit more shallow people, but just as safe. Good food, people are always nice too.

Summary: I would definitely go again, thoroughly enjoyed my time, didn't have a single issue, met tons of people, great sushi.",solotravel,Marco_Tarik92

Help with SEA Itinerary,"Hello everyone! 

The only thing keeping me sane lately is diving into planning trips and one that I've really, really been looking forward to is Southeast Asia. I know this is a great place for solo backpackers to embark on first-time longer trips, so want to travel there first! I've done solo trips but my longest is only three months, with a friend joining me for the last month, and I'm hoping to spend 4 to 5 months in SEA. Below is my rough itinerary, in the order that I would be doing the travelling. 

Thailand: Bangkok - Sukhothai - Chang Mai (&amp; Mae Hong Loop)

Myanmar: Bagan, Inle Lake, Shwedagon Pagoda, Golden Rock

Back into Thailand: Pai &amp; Chiang Rai

Laos: Luang Prabang - Nong Khiaw - Muang Ngoi - Vang Vieng - Vientiane

Vietnam: Hanoi - Sapa - Ha Long Bay - Optional Adventure: The Ha Giang Loop – 3 Days - Phong Nha National Park - Hue - Hoi An - Dalat - Mui Ne - Ho Chi Minh City

Cambodia: Phnom Penh - Kep - Kampot - Koh Rong - Siem Reap 

Southern Thailand: Bangkok - Surat Thani -  Kho Phangan - Koh Tao - Khao Sok National Park - Krabi- Phi Phi Islands - Railay and Ton Sai - Koh Lipe

Malaysia: Langkawi - Penang - Taman Negara - Cameron highlands - Kuala Lumpur 

Singapore (only 2-3 days here)

Indonesia: Bali, Mount Bromo, Borneo, Komodo Islands, Sumatra, Lombok 

**My main questions are:** Would you add or leave out anything from this itinerary? How long do you think it'll take to do this realistically? (I'm a medium-paced traveler, I can stay in some places for 3 days and others for a week if I really like them, so it usually balances out). How much would you budget for this kind of trip?

Was there anything you did / saw / place you stayed at in SEA that you would say is a must do? 

Thanks so much in advance for the help!",solotravel,nug-princess
"cancelled ticket, so dreaming of where to go with my mass amount of flight points!","With hopes of the vaccine being accessible by spring-summer next year, I've started thinking about places to go once life starts to go back to normal.

Any suggestions for a 3 month long trip? Can I do Europe and SEA in that time?,"Hi guys. Assuming the pandemic is a thing of the past by May 2021 (I know it's not a given but let's assume it is for the purposes of this), I'm looking to do a big trip since I'm graduating college and don't start my job until August or September (my choice). 

I want to do an epic adventure, but I'm not sure where to begin. I really want to explore all of Europe (especially eastern europe) as well as southeast Asia. I want to live in hostels, party, eat good food, and meet cool people, but I'm also really interested in hiking at some unique places. For a trip this long, I can see myself getting lonely so making some friends is a must. I've never traveled solo, but I've been  to Australia and NZ with my friend, and to a bunch of places with family when I was younger.

If I have about 3 months to do this, what would you recommend? I just need a solid starting point for beginning my planning.

I have saved a lot throughout the years for something like this and my budget is &gt;$15,000 (although I want to get value for my money and I don't care for fancy hotels or restaurants).",solotravel,bsrbsrbrs

Off to Colombia on a solo trip next week - any last-minute tips?,"I'm flying to Cartagena, Colombia next Saturday. Will be spending 7(ish) weeks in Colombia. First time in South America so I'm very excited. I have a rough itinerary below...

* Cartagena (3 nights)
* Santa Marta (4 nights)
* Lost City trek (4 nights)
* Palomino (3 nights)
* Minca (4 nights)
* Bogota (3 nights)
* Salento (3 nights)
* Medellin (6 nights) (With some time spent in Guatape)
* Pereira (3 nights)
* Cali (4 nights)

After that, I either plan on staying in Colombia for the final two weeks of the trip or potentially heading to Dominican Republic. See what happens! I've not booked anything yet (bar 2 nights in Cartagena) so this is an extremely rough plan. I've also looked at going to San Andres y Providencia but the horrendous events of the past week there (Hurricane Iota) make that increasingly unlikely...

Do you think it is unethical/irresponsible to travel in the covid era?,"My vacation is coming up on November 21st and normally I go to Greece for a month to escape the cold of New Jersey(USA) around this time of the year, but Americans can't travel to Europe. Covid looks like it will last over a year and we have to return to normal life sometime, but by traveling I will likely feel a little guilt. I am thinking of maybe traveling within the USA to warmer areas down South, since I really haven't been around most of the country. 

I travel alone all the time, so it would be easy for me to avoid other people and I am wondering if traveling alone in a hotel room by myself would be less harmful than staying at home with my family?

Backpack Essentials?,"Hi everyone,

My girlfriend is going to China for a year and a half for work, and she had asked for a few things (backpack, travel blanket, etc.).

I want to put this all together as a big Christmas gift. Are there any essentials that are small/lightweight?

I have the backpack, and then inside I have a compact travel blanket, extra iPhone charging cables, a water bottle, a waist strap for the bag, small carry-on-sized bottles, and some organizer bags for her suitcase.

I thought something like a travel quick-drying towel would be useful, and I also thought about water shoes for the beaches,  but I also don't want to fill up her bag with stuff she hasn't specifically asked for and/or won't use. I'm probably going to go with the towel because it's light and can really pack light.

She already has a good size portable charger and two power cubes.

Extended Solo Stay in Mexico,"I was recently told by my company that we won't be going back to the office until at least April 2021.

Currently, I'm targeting Mexico (probably Playa del Carmen) for a January/February stay.

How responsible is it to travel to Southern CA right now?,"My brother wanted me to visit for Thanksgiving, so over the Summer he bought me a flights from NYC to southern CA. He bought me tickets that leave a week before Thanksgiving. Now as things approach I and things are locking down I am getting hesitant. Actually earlier today I decided not to go, but when I did that I realized how much I needed this trip. I cant drive, I live in the city and I LITERALLY have not traveled more than 20 blocks since March. I feel like I am emotionally about to break, and I get a sense that everything is locking down again, and I am genuinely concerned about my mental health over the Winter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the plan I have: I plan to fly on a mostly empty night flight, and NOT stay with my brother, self quarantine at an airbnb for the 14 days (take a Covid test before I leave and a molecular CoVID  test 7 days after my flight for peek accuracy) After that second test is confirmed negative I would do a socially distanced Thanksgiving with him and his wife outside.  After the two weeks are up I would stay with him for another week and then drive up to Northern CA with him (as he needs to drive up to SF) where I then would fly out of SFO.

Some people are like ""DONT LEAVE YOUR HOUSE!!"" and other people like ""don't worry about it I was on a flight last week, its fine!""

However... I also see that this is only available to those individuals that had previously been granted permits prior to the borders closing earlier in the year.  Does anyone have experience with entering Nepal since these new policies were put in place?  Can I be granted a permit now and go?",solotravel,G---son
Month Long Workation Accommodations: Any feedback?,"As usual, all of this is relative to pandemic status next year. But.

I'm lucky enough to make good money working from home with a flexible enough schedule to do workations. I'm very attracted to the idea of month long jaunts (basically turns 3-5 weeks yearly of travel into several months), and I'm looking to crowd source a few opinions on this.

I know there are serviced apartments you can rent, especially in places like Bangkok (a target of mine) but I really don't think I'd have as much fun holed up in an apartment, whereas I can still meet people in a hostel. Do some of the long-term deals tend to carry over into private rooms in hostels, in anyone's experience? Alternative suggestions that meet in the middle?

This is less of a concern for other itineraries I'm thinking about (something like a week each in Barceona, Madrid, Valencia, and Morocco) because I know hopping around will be involved. On this note, does anyone have experience with 1-2 week hops between cities while doing it vs. choosing a ""home base"", and what were some things that might be worth considering between the two?",solotravel,jtrom1010
"With 14 days (excl travel), do you do Prague + another nearby country or stay in the CR?","Just doing some tentative research for next summer (COVID willing), and strongly considering making Prague the next place I hit for solo travel. I've done years of research and couldn't be more thrilled with the choice.

I'm not the type to hit as many countries as possible just to do it, but 5-7 days in a city (maybe less depending where) is usually enough for me. I have done a big time dive into what to do in the CR and I can't say anything excites me so far. If I'm already out there, I'm leaning towards making it a Prague +Vienna/Budapest/Munich/something like that combo rather than taking my time to explore the rest of the Czech Republic.

I love natural beauty and the small town charm, but I'm always more thrilled by a bit of culture shock, food, nightlife, and interesting architecture/history.

Am I missing out on some big time hidden gems in the Czech Republic? I'm less concerned about the logistics of country hopping than I am potentially robbing myself by writing off the rest of a sizeable nation while I'm there.

**Edit:** Wow guys, thanks so much for all the feedback! Few things:

I've settled on Prague, Budapest, and a 3 day stretch between Vienna and Bratislava in between. How I split that up is TBD, but with that, I can pick and choose how to spend that time and I can do it midweek so I get weekend days in Prague and Budapest both. 

Also, apparently my wording was ambiguous. Prague was never in play for 2 full weeks, my original question was mostly ""should I do this apparently popular country hop"" or really dig into all the CR has to offer? However, nonetheless, all my questions have been answered and I'm more excited now than when I posted. :) ",solotravel,jtrom1010

Solo trip to Canary Islands,"Hi guys! Just wanted to share with you my latest experience in the Canary Islands (Spain).

* **Trip Length**

The trip lasted 14 days broken down in this way: 4 days Tenerife, 4 days Gran Canaria, 5 days Fuerteventura and 1 day Lanzarote. I was hoping to visit the remaining 3 smaller islands but unfortunately I ran our of time. That's a good excuse to come back soon!

* **Covid-19 situation**

I  flew from the UK and there was no quarantine required upon arrival nor negative test certification (I went there in Mid-October so the situation might have changed in the meantime). However, you are required to download and fill an health control form and obtain your QR Code, to show it at the control points upon arrival in Spain. Also, a temperature check is performed at the airport.

All shops/restaurants/bars were open until late in the evening and masks are mandatory both inside and outside. Very few tourists everywhere and hotels/resorts/beaches mostly empty.

* **Logistics**

There are plenty of daily flights from London and I paid £30 only (one-way to Tenerife) with 2 luggages. The price carrying one luggage only was £12! I also flew from Gran Canaria to Fuerteventura, the flight takes approx. 30mins and I paid £20. From Tenerife to Gran Canaria I decided to catch a ferry, the problem is that I booked it only few days in advance and I ended up paying £70 for a 1,40h journey. Lesson learnt for the next time!

Once you arrive, the best way to go around is renting a car.   

You should rent a car at the airport. It’s better reserving the car on [www.rentalcars.com](http://www.rentalcars.com/) where you can find very good deals. Be aware that on top of the price you see on the website, you will need to pay the insurance, which is normally around 50/70£ for 4 days of renting. You could also choose not to pay for the insurance, but then you will have to pay upfront for a deposit of £1,100 (I chose this option in Tenerife and I got my deposit back after one week). Generally,, the roads in Tenerife and Gran Canaria are very good, especially in Tenerife where there is a main highway surrounding the Teide volcano and the traffic is not crazy at all. Fuerteventura is wilder, many roads are not paved so having an insurance is highly recommended. Renting a car is absolutely the best way to explore the island on your own and I would strongly recommend it. Also, fuel is super cheap at approx. 0,8EUR/liter so a full tank for a small car would not cost more than 50 EUR. 

* **Tenerife (Accommodation- What to see)**

I stayed in Playa de las Americas, in the South part of the island. In normal conditions, this would be the party place of the island, with loads of hotels, resorts, bars and restaurants. It’s a very clean and beautiful town, however due to covid, it was literally a ghost town (which I totally didn’t mind as I was somewhere else exploring every single day). Be aware that there are no beaches here (as in the whole island basically), but you could stay in a luxurious 5 star mega-pool resort for 60/70£ a night, like I did. To be honest this was not the best option for me as I've never used the pool or the other facilities of the resort and I could have stayed in a much cheaper place. Another lesson learnt for the next time.

 If you want to experience a more vibrant town, probably you should opt staying in Santa Cruz, the capital, especially if you land in Tenerife North Airport.

1. Teide Volcano and the surrounding National Park- what else?? Absolutely amazing. Plan to stay there a whole day. You can reach 2,500 mt with your own car, then if you want to proceed further, there is a cable car which takes you to 3,500mt. Bring a jacket/jumper with you as the temperature when I climbed was about 5/7 degrees. Tickets to the cable car can be bought online (it costs around 25 EUR). Normally there are long lines but due to the corona I was barely the only person there.

2. Santa Cruz de Tenerife- nice to wander around for few hours, especially if you fancy nice local restaurants. 

3. National Park of Anaga- in the North of the island. You can spend here easily the entire day hiking the spectacular mountains. It’s rather a green area so the landscape is totally different from the Teide National Park. Be aware that the roads are good but being on the slopes of high mountains….it might be a bit overwhelming driving through.

4. Punta de Teno- the most western part of the island, quite difficult to get there. To avoid crowds getting there, the road is closed every day from 10 to 19 and only buses go there in between. There is an amazing lighthouse at the very end of the road which you should reach at sunset to remain astonished by the view. I went there at sunset after 19 with my own car. Absolutely worth it.

5. Vineyards/wine tasting close to Pueblo de la Cruz- Actually didn’t go there but I heard it’s worth a visit- keep this as a back-up plan in case you end up having some spare time.

* **Gran Canaria (Accommodation- What to see)**

I opted for an hotel in Maspalomas, in the South of the island. Paid £50 a night with breakfast included. I could have spent lot less also here, but I wanted to be comfortable.

Gran Canaria in my opinion is the less interesting island I've visited. It's very commercial and apart from the Maspalomas dunes (which are stunning) and some hikes, the other parts of the island are not impressive at all. I spent there 4 days but I suggest cutting to 3 days max.

1. Maspalomas dunes. 

2. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. The capital city. The city center is buzzling- full of cute bars/restaurants 

* **Fuerteventura (Accommodation- What to see)**

In my opinion, the best island in terms of landscapes.   

I stayed in the North, Corralejo. It’s a very cute town with lot of restaurants and bars. The North side of the island is well known for its surfing activities, so you will find a lot of surf houses and a “hippy vibe”.  Highly recommended. You could also opt to stay in the South in Costa Calma, which has amazing beaches but when I went there most of the places/resorts were closed and it lacked some vibe. Not recommended, at least nowadays.

1. Corralejo dunes- it’s a Natural park where you will find real desert dunes and a long beach to relax.

2. El Castillo beaches (especially Playa de los Lagos and Playa de la Concha where you can use your sun cream a lot…)- not far from Corralejo, go there for the best sunset of the whole island. There is a lighthouse and the scenery is very cool, especially because I brought a drone and I got very cool shots.

3. Caldern Horno- it’s a small volcano, you can climb it and get very cool photos

4. Cofete Beach- the most difficult beach to reach- you have to drive a long dirty road but…it was probably the best place I have seen in the whole trip. There is a small cemetery on the sand…if you get there at sunset it’s stunning. Be aware that you cannot swim there (the whole Western coast of Fuerte is not recommended to swim because of the strong sea and winds).

5. Sotavento beach - this is probably the best beach if you want to practice kitesurf/windsurf- it’s like 5km long, yellow fine sand and turquoise water. Amazing.

6. Playa de Esquinzo- the most famous for surfers- it’s on the West side so again not the best to swim, but the scenery is stunning especially at sunset.

7. All the windmills around the island, there are many and you can make cool shots of them.

8. Costa Calma- this is a resort place, so quite empty, but the best beaches are there- strongly recommended if your goals is just to lay under the sun

I spent only few hours in Lanzarote on a day trip from Fuerteventura catching a ferry (price 60£ with the car) so really cannot comment much. However, I managed to drive through the Timanfaya National Park and it looks like a Martian landscape, absolutely unreal.

Recommendations for Southern New Mexico and Arizona,"I have an unexpected 7 or 8 days off coming up in about a week and I'm thinking I'd like to take the time to explore more of Southern New Mexico and possibly some of Southern Arizona. My focus is to almost exclusively spend time in nature with maybe a pitstop for good cuisine here and there. I'll be driving from Northern Colorado in a capable 4x4 vehicle and plan to camp on Federal land every night.


I haven't spent much time in the Southern portions of those states. For New Mexico, I've been to Carlsbad Cavern and White Sanda (newly designated!) National Park. For Arizona, I've been to Tuscon briefly and Tombstone (regrettable lol). 


So far my only plans are to explore around Lincoln National Forest and Gila National Forest. I still need to do more research but it would be awesome if anyone has any recommendations for beautiful and interesting places to check out in that region of the Southwest.",solotravel,ChickenLickinDiddler
I am in search of interesting countries for a trip next year.,"


Hello fellow travelers.
I want to on interesting trip next year. Since my plans for this year got screwed thanks to Covid. I want it to be something that i remember a long time and i don’t have regret in the aftermath. You will find more informations below.

I am from Germany.  I already did a bicycle tour from Switzerland to Berlin. Most of my other trips were basically sightseeing holidays. My only adventure trip until now was in norway for two weeks.

I already visited following countries:

-Austria
-Switzerland 
-France
-Italy (5-times)
-Spain (2-times)
-England
-Norway
-Belgium
-Netherlands

Countries which would interest me:

-Ireland
-Singapore
-South Korea
-Sri Lanka
-Australia 
-New Zealand

Length: Between 3 -6 weeks (June to august)

Budget: Enough to afford six weeks sightseeing, accommodation, flights and so on

Interests:

-Culture and food 
-Great and memorable views 
-Meeting interesting people 

Kind of trip I want:
I honestly enjoy both adventure trips and sightseeing trips. 


I am open to suggestions regarding other countries as well. My preference lies outside of Europe. As mentioned above i want it to be a trip which memories I can share with friends and family. Leaving my own comfort zone and journey through other countries before i start my own family is one of my biggest aims. I don’t want to regret my decision in a few years from now.

Thanks for all your suggestions in advance. Stay safe.",solotravel,Black-Maria-one-piec
"Adjusting to ""Normal Life""","Hey y'all, I'm hoping to hear back from some long term travelers, who no longer travel so much. 

I'm sure most solo travelers, especially long term travelers, understand me when I talk about how easy it is to make connections with people while on the road. You go to a hostel, there's a person sitting at a table, you can basically walk up to them, strike a conversation about deep personal things, and within 30 minutes, you and this person feel like you've known each other your whole lives, and are now planning to hitchhike together to the nearest rainbow gathering sleeping under trees in the same tent because there is a sense of trust. 

Countless times this happens in different variations, it is CRAZY how many people I found myself thinking ""holy shit, we could actually be best friends wtf"" because of how personal the conversations were, how loving and accepting and trusting people are while on the road. Same with couchsurfing, and hitchhiking, and volunteering, etc etc etc. 

Now to present day. I'm starting a seasonal job in the US, it's my first official, legal job where I will have roots for the next 6 months. And I am trying to make friends here. 

But damn. It has not been easy for me. I'm so used to this instant vulnerability with people, and I'm so used to just opening up basically immediately to people because of how common place it always has been while moving around, but I don't think that non-traveling people respond very well to this sort of instant interaction. I think I might actually frighten them away? 

My feeling is that it's seen as suspicious. So, I guess what I'm asking is, how the hell do I make friends with people in a stable or regular sort of life? The travel way isn't working, so I'm not entirely sure. 

Tips for readjusting are appreciated!",solotravel,kittenklyn

"How to travel with others when solo travel is much preferred, finding balance","How does one plan a hybrid trip with others when the plans change completely, and go in a different direction than even alternative preferences due to schedule or budget limitations that are not shared?

I have been speaking with some friends about a trip for some time now but the plan has changed from the original idea due to a combination of Covid fears, budget and schedule. I feel bad bailing as we've been talking about this for a while, but our first choice and my alternative preference have both been decided against for a third place which I don't really care for ATM as the main draw is not in active season and there is not much culinary excitement which is my primary interest. 

The others want to travel just to go ""anywhere but here"" but I am a little more deliberate with my travel. That being said, I find myself at times wanting to be flexible and go on group trips just to go on a group trip but I am finding it difficult to commit, also because of fear of being the odd guy out and go against the flow since I prefer solo travel or travel with specific friends that I know we can align well.

There is still opportunity for me to go solo to my alternative beforehand and meet up with the group at their choice not too far away but the itinerary they are planning is fitting a lot into a short period of time. If I were to arrive after to shorten my participation, it could be difficult to join up with the others physically, and/or align energy-wise.

I am having a hard time finding the flexibility within me to join. But I feel bad bailing despite having fair reasons. 

Fellow solo travelers, how do you make hybrid trips like this work? Should I be more flexible, visit my alternate choice and meet up after and go along for the ride or do I call that it has gone too far in a different direction and just politely decline? If I were to go all that way to my alternate and not join with the others at their nearby choice, it probably would not be well perceived. So it seems to be coming down to an all-or-nothing.

I have only traveled international twice. Both times to Japan. I went solo to japan last year. I want to go again but have mixed feelings about my experience going alone,"I have been to japan twice. 

- Once with a group of 5 friends for two weeks, We went all around japan (Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fuji, Kyoto)
- Once solo for two weeks (I just stayed in Tokyo and didnt do any day trips for two weeks)

The first time I went was interesting. I enjoyed being with my friends but most nights we all wanted to do different things, all had different budgets and regardless of what we did one person wasn't satisfied with what we did. Overall I did enjoy it though as it was much better with friends

The 2nd time I went, Was solo. I liked this a lot more as I got to see and do whatever I wanted without having to worry what my friends did, This was okay for the first week however towards the end of my trip I did feel rather lonely as I hadn't really made any friends and the majority of things I did was all solo.

Im fairly introverted. I tried using meetup/air bnb events to make things interesting but ultimately I got bored very quickly. It also probably didnt help that I chose to stay in Tokyo for the whole two weeks and I ended up just going to arcades everyday for the last 3 or 4 days of my trip. This trip was incredibly low budget, I stayed in hostels and ate cheap food as I thought it would be more wise to spend money on activities and experiences rather than food.

Anyhow. I want to go back again next year for the 3rd time. It most likely will be solo again as my close friend circle are relatively poor with money and spending and they wont be willing to spend a few thousand dollars traveling.

What were some of the things you do when solo traveling to enjoy yourself more?

How do you manage work vs. travel?,"I’m a 22 year old dude and have been working full-time for about the last 2+ years. I’ve been overseas twice, but both times with my family and siblings when I was younger - New Zealand when I was like 14 and the US when I was 17. 

Now that I’m working full time, I guess I’m wondering how most of you manage work and travelling? I really don’t want to live with regrets, I already am worried about wasting my youth and getting stuck, and I’m really interested in travelling so I really want to solo travel/travel with friends while I’m young. (Not that you can’t do it when you’re older, but I guess it would be a little different)

Do most of you just travel in your annual leave/vacation time? Do you get a new job and travel when you’re between jobs? Do you take unpaid leave? Do you quit without something else lined up and just worry about it when you get back?

I’m fortunate that I still live at home currently, with very low expenses so it would be easier for me to just quit, but I’m still wondering about what all of you amazing people do. I may move out over the next year or two. And want to travel once we get through this whole pandemic thing 

I don’t know what it’s called, but I’ve heard of people who try to work a couple of years and save, then travel for a bit and repeat, which sounds cool.

Not sure if that's b/c of COVID or if that's regular prices in the Winter but it beats paying $1200 a month in the winter here. 

Anyways, my top priorities are (in no specific order): 1) need decent internet 2) would like warm beaches 3) safe 4) decent dating prospects. 

I'm thinking Santiago, Chile; Rio, Brazil, and Sao Paulo, Brazil are worth visiting for a month each, but I'm open to other places as well like Colombia but Bogota, Medellin, &amp; Cartagena are in the Northern Hemisphere so maybe I can do Colombia in April?",solotravel,AndreNowzick
Anyone else hates a guitarist at the hostel?,"I'm probably in the minority here, but I can't stand people who play guitar in the hostel - especially those who bring their own. People don't play their music playlist on a Bluetooth speaker out in the common area, because that'd be rude and inconsiderate, but why is acceptable for people to play the guitar? Sometimes they can also sing, so they do, or someone who sings would join in. The solo travellers who bring their own guitar is so baffling to me, it's such a cumbersome instrument to carry across the world, backpacking - and if they're travelling by themselves, staying at hostels, did they bring it for my benefit? I certainly didn't request it. Or is it to get a bit of an ego boost?",solotravel,joereadsstuff

Thinking about solo traveling,"So I’m new to the whole solo travel thing. I’m 18 years old, and working a part time job at a place I hate. I hate my boss, and he hired 2 family members and gave them full time switching us to part time. So now I only make around $300 - $450 a paycheck. 

Unfortunately there’s no way I can work remotely working at a Grocery Outlet (If I’m not allowed to put the name I will edit and fix this) unless  someone else knows something I don’t about remote work for them, I’ve looked around but haven’t found anything.

I’ve looked into online jobs, I’ve applied for Rev.com but didn’t get accepted. 

My “plan” was to buy a laptop, get an online job, buy a van or something, build a nice interior to sleep, cool, etc. and get solar panels for charging. But, there’s multiple ways I can go about this, just don’t know the best one.

1. Go to college.
If needed, I could go to college for some kind of e-commerce, or computer science. (I know Python, and I absolutely love computers. I’ve been in love with programming, building them, etc for years.)

2. Get a contract for an at sea processor.
I could go out to sea and process seafood and make $16 - $27/hr with 16 hour days, 7 days a week, and for 65 - 90+ days. I could go out to sea, come back with like $19k and then leave to travel. 

3. Become a Digital Nomad.
I could use a combo of a college degree and score a nice online job, buy a laptop (I have a pc at my parents home to work on atm) and then fly to Chiang Mai, or somewhere, I don’t know.

My dream is to travel, I’m willing to do what it takes to make my dream come true, if you have any suggestions that would be appreciated!",solotravel,BlueColdBellPeppers

Weirdest people you've met while travelling?,"I'll start. Sorry in advanced for the long post. It's a doozy, but I'll try to keep it as concise as possible.

tl;dr: I (25M) met and spent an evening with a drunk, creepy middle aged dude from Dubai who borderline tried to be my sugar daddy and set me up with his 13 year old daughter back at home, and got upset when I got the fuck outta there.

I was in Phnom Penh by myself at a night market and I met a middle aged man from Dubai at an ice cream stall, also alone. He seemed friendly, his english was okay, so we talked for a bit and I kindly said goodbye.

I bumped into him again on the street. He insisted he buy me a beer. Sure why not, and I buy him a round to return the favour. He continues trying to buy me beer throughout the night, but I know my limit and won't get pressured to go past it. I get up to a buzz (3 or 4 beers in) and say no more, which he gets slightly upset about.

Throughout the night he would point to young local women around us and give me a creepy smile and laugh. He talked about how the prostitute he hired in Thailand stole his money, and how he has to pay for sex but it's free for me because I'm young. He says if I ever came to Dubai he'd pay for everything and he has more than $150k USD in his bank account. He insisted we go to a bar and I be a wingman for him. I say NOPE to all of this and he said something like ""come oooon, what's wrong with you? You're young!"" which he said every time I said no to anything.

Things got really weird when he started talking about his ""very beautiful"" 13 year old daughter and how he would show me more pics of her if I have time to stop by his hotel room. Now, I've never been to Dubai and am unfamiliar with the culture, but maybe this is part of it (please correct me if I'm wrong), but that's fucked up in most parts of the world. 

I'm not stupid and wasn't going to spend any more time with him past my own amusement, so throughout the evening I had stated many times that I will leave at 10pm. At this point it was 9:30 and I wanted to bounce. He insisted we get food before I leave. Fine, last thing with this guy.

Finally after we eat, I say ""alright, I gotta go now!"" He starts acting appalled and gets extremely upset (like I hadn't been saying I needed to leave at 10 all throughout the night), saying things like ""you don't want to hang out with me, fine. I buy you food, I do this and that and you still want to leave early!"" I say ""I never asked you to buy me anything, you've insisted! I've told you numerous times that I will leave at 10, and I will."" He starts guilting me, saying ""fine, go then. No don't worry about this meal, I said I'd pay for it and I will, and you still want to go. Fine."" I say ""nope I'll pay for my own meal. Nice meeting you, see you later!"" and I got the fuck outta there.

Maybe it was just a typical encounter with a lonely, drunk, creepy middle aged man from Dubai, but boy was an encounter with this type of person weird to me.

SO, who have been the weirdest people you've met/hung out with while solo?",solotravel,CrustyLipschitz

Israel- seems very spiritual and I’ve actually heard it’s really safe and peaceful. It would be amazingly intimate to visit places the Bible has mentioned. 

Greece- I’ve wanted to do this one for a long time but only two or three mentioned this. 

Taiwan- why not? 

Alaska- I wouldn’t mind living in the freezing cold for a little- as long as I’m alone and free thinking. 

Hawaii- still on my list and it is in the U.S. which might be more feasible if I do travel in February.

Maldives- sounds relaxing 

Ireland- I got a lot of people saying this one and I sure wouldn’t mind. 

Most of these are open to travel with a negative

First Solo Trip - How to Cope with Massive Change in Perspective?,"Before I decided to take this trip, I was very comfortable in life. I had a great job, a good gf, and a routine in life where I branched out of my comfort zone once in a while. However, after talking with a couple of close friends and taking LSD, I decided I didn't want a life of constant comfort/familiarity. I aggressively interviewed for a better job, broke up with my gf, and booked a solo trip to Mexico - I jumped in the deep end.

I just got back from my trip and it was possibly the best experience in my life. Where I'm from in the US, the culture is heavily based around money/status/material objects. However, when I was in Mexico, I didn't see many luxury cars and mansions, but rather met amazing individuals with strong personalities/character. There were quite a few people who pursued creative careers where they got to express themselves, people who I had just met being extremely welcoming, offering me drinks, suggestions on where to go, and access to anything I wanted. If we partied too hard one night, they offered to look after me, made sure I was having a good time and ultimately being safe. Even though the trip was only 2 weeks, by the end of it I felt closer to them than some of my best friends. 

I'm feeling very confused and sad now, because it feels like my worldview and values changed. I felt like I was my authentic self when I was alone in Mexico - so much more extroverted, meeting new people everyday, going on dates, and loving life. I felt like I truly had a passion for life and not just chasing the same things people around me are/going through motions. Now that I'm back home in the same place, with the same people, doing the same things, my mindset is reverting back to the old me. It feels like a lot of what I previously valued went out the window and I have more appreciation for exploring new places, meeting likeminded and kindhearted people, and living life to the fullest.

Is this a phase that will eventually pass? While I don't want to be sad anymore, I definitely don't want to crawl back into a life of extreme comfort.",solotravel,1stTimeTravels

New name while traveling,"Does anybody else go by (a) different name(s) while they’re traveling? 

I never really liked my full first name or the default shortened version of it. I’m from the northeast US and the first vowel is an “a” followed by a double consonant so its already overly nasal, but also since English has like 8 different ways “a” can be pronounced, accents have a HUGE effect on the way it comes out. Half the time i feel like I’M saying it wrong! 

I recently left to solo travel around the US doing workaways and seasonal jobs and have been going by a different nickname; one that’s still contained in the original, just an isolation of the middle syllable. It’s short, sweet, and easy to pronounce and remember. It’s taken a minute to adjust To it but honestly it fits well! I feel like a new person, like I’m really getting a fresh start.

No one back home knows I’m doing this and I feel like they would laugh. Maybe because it seems arbitrary, maybe because the new name is cooler and they think I’m trying too hard, maybe because it sounds like it’s short for something else entirely. I don’t care, I like it.

If I finish in my first city and decide I don’t like how it feels, I still have two or three other nicknames I can extract from my birth name (thanks dad!). When I move onto my next place I can always switch it up again and try something new! Maybe I’ll adopt a slightly different persona based on the nickname and region, who knows! The possibilities are endless! 

If you guys have ever done something like this, let me know how it turned out for you. Is it confusing to keep it all straight? Does it always feel like lying? Do you find that your personality shifts with the name? I feel like at the very least, this could be a cool social experiment.",solotravel,cjwellz13
"Met someone special, things could be great, 2020 thought otherwise, a lesson is learned","So, a little less than a year ago, I’ve traveled solo to Buenos Aires where I stayed for a month. Everything was great and became even better during my last week there, when I’ve met this cute and quite unconventional girl. She was also a foreigner, a (much more experienced) solo traveler, and she was staying there for a couple of months or so. From the moment I laid my eyes on her I knew she was special. Our first encounter confirmed that. I like to believe that she saw something in me as well. We’ve spent some relaxing time together (sightseeing, sitting in parks and just talk, taking lunch, etc.), but nothing more. 

Knowing that there was only a few days left for me there, and given the fact that I was in a near to end longtime relationship (which I also told her about), any thought of taking things further seemed pointless and inappropriate. Also, I wasn't so sure about my actual feelings for her, since I didn't knew her that well yet. Saying goodbye was tough, but I remained positive knowing that being in touch, it would give us the opportunity to know each other better and maybe meet again somehow down the road... I thought.

Long story short, came back home, ended my longtime relationship (not the easiest period for me), while messaging with her at an almost daily basis. At the beginning she was very responsive, playful and always so thoughtful, which made me think about her a lot during the days. It was obvious though that she was expecting something more from my part. I let her down. I didn’t respond as I should. Instead I was trying to be rational and keep things friendly and casual. I also needed to clear my head from my recent, difficult, brake up. There will be a better moment for this… I was thinking.

That’s when I started noticing her initial warm reactions to gradually cool down. This shook me up a little, and made me realize how much I liked her. Right before I enter the friend zone (or maybe a little bit after), I decided that, even if it’s late and despite knowing that I was risking our still fragile friendship, I had to be more direct with her. 

And then… covid-19 happened, quarantine imposed, her flight back home canceled and everything else became secondary. I naturally shifted my focus on her safety and tried to be helpful, supportive and a little advisory. When she is back home, safe and relaxed, then we can discuss about anything. The last thing she needs right now, is me writing about pink purple skies and smooth fiery lips… I thought.

Meanwhile, she had previously met and made friends with a local guy, and since she was trying to find a better (to her current miserable) place to stay and reduce costs as well, she apparently accepted his offer to go and stay with him, until her departure. To be fair though, I don't really know if that's the way it happened. Only my assumption.

But again, a couple of days before she was about to fly back home, Argentina (only country in the world) banned all inbound and outbound flights for the next 4-5 months! She now was a foreign girl in a foreign country, jobless, and with no other option than to stay there and try to weather this pandemic storm and the upcoming threatening winter. That’s when you realize that, not being able to help someone you care about so much, it’s probably the worst feeling ever! I should also mention that I offered some financial help, but her being such a proud (and stubborn) person, didn’t want to hear any of that.

Soon, the frequency of her messaging started to drop and after a relatively long period of silence, she came back with a lengthy message stating, among other, that she is ok and that “there’s been some… developments”, and her up to then roommate is now her boyfriend.

To be honest, I thought I was prepared for this eventuality (for which I blame none but myself), but it struck me much harder than I could possibly imagine. I’ve sent back a relatively ~~charged~~ emotional message along with a poem I had written before, where I made clear my feelings for her. I also stated that I understand, and although it might take some time, I will eventually write back since my caring and interest for her was real and above anything else.

It took more than a month, when I finally sent a long and relatively friendly letter, hoping to at least re-establish some basic communication. A few days later, instead of an answer I discovered that I got blocked (for the first time in my life, yeah!). Such a weird feeling. A big “why”, zero answers, and a few uncertain and contradictory assumptions, is all you left with. For the rest of your existence!

But it’s been more than two months now, and during this period the situation in Argentina went downhill in multiple ways, so it’s difficult for me to stop thinking and worrying about her. They say that time cures everything, and that the best antidote is to just meet new people. I did that, moved on, but to be honest, I still have this bad taste in mouth from how things ended up. More importantly though, I simply miss my once friend and I can only hope that she’s ok.

Anyway, this is a lesson learned and at the same time my advice to anyone (especially travelers): if you unexpectedly meet someone truly special for you, make her/him your overall priority, change schedules, forget about others, and let her/him know exactly how you feel. Don’t wait for the “proper” moment. And as we all know very well by now, tomorrow should never be taken for granted. Neither the feelings of another person.

Safe travels to all

EDIT: 

Ok I admit that my reaction was probably a mistake and I can see this more clearly now. But again, it's better to show your annoyance verbally (or written) than not say anything at all. Especially when there's the distance factor which leads to many misinterpretations, no matter how cool and smart the other person is.",solotravel,leo_4m
"I feel that I'm getting too comfortable with the 9-5 life, and that it's going to be difficult to long term travel again.","So bit of backstory, I made [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/g85w4p/ive_come_to_a_decision_on_what_to_do_once_this/) about 6 months ago. From that point, I've found a very well paying job, as well as an incredibly affordable living situation. With the current state of affairs of the world, I am still shooting to leave in late 2021 for a 12-18 month trip around the world.

What makes me nervous is I'm getting too comfortable with my 9-5 job life, I am making quite a bit more than I thought I would be, so I'm saving 3x more for my trip then I need. I like my job, and really like my relaxing life right now. With the rate I'm saving, I could literally pay off all of my student loans within 12 months.  Given quarantine, I am spending quite a bit more time and money on my home space, and frankly on the year leading up to my initial trip, I was minimalizing my possessions so it would be easier to leave everything behind. I feel comfortable hanging out at home all day now, I love to travel but right now my home office feels relaxing.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go on this grand adventure around the world, I want to do something that most people in American society will never have the opportunity to do. I want to see how much a 12+ month trip will change me as a person, but I'm getting nervous that when the time comes to send in my resignation, I won't be able to do it. I had so much energy and excitement to leave in May 2020, but since that didn't happen and I don't know how long it's going to be until I can leave now, I don't know how to target my energy?

Anyone else feeling these vibes?

Edit: As many people are questioning the topic of finances. This is my issue, I literally set up my entire life up until the point where I want to leave to save money.  I could have afforded a really nice apartment, instead I'm living with 3 room mates, I could afford to treat myself and eat out more, instead I meal prep and shop with coupons, etc. I planned to sell my truck, my motorcycle, about $5000 worth of mechanic tools, etc.So money is the last worry in my mind, It's all about personal feelings at this point.

Financial Plan at the moment, which will be fully funded by August of 2021:

\- 6 months of living expenses in case of unemployment.

\- 12 months of everyday travel costs - this factors in not working on the road, day to day expenses. When volunteering/working along the way, I can bump this to 14-18 months.

\- 18 months of student loan payments for the entire time I'm gone.

\- a few thousand in my 401k and roth IRA up until the point where I leave, as I want to contribute to that as much as I can in my youth.

\- Around 10,000 dollars left over for savings once I get home, as I don't want to be completely broke savings wise. Rolling back into the USA being like ""I only have $4"" while boarding my plane home is not the way I want to end things.

So Don't worry, I'm being financially responsible :)

EDIT 2: Once again, Finances are not the problem, Student loans are not the problem, paying off student loans are not a problem or even a concerning thought. With this plan I will have all of my student loans payed off in 4 years or less. Please stop saying I'm dumb for not paying off student loans immediately and pushing my already delayed trip that was the only thing keeping me sane throughout my graduate program back another 12 months. If I was smart I would drop the $20,000 I have saved for this trip into the stock market instead of blowing it traveling around the world for an entire year. This isn't about the money.  


  
EDIT 3: Decided the best way to get out of this slump is to travel more, Currently looking at flights for late November for safer locations, Possibly camping somewhere or a more distanced holiday. ",solotravel,mordor958

1 Week in Peru: May 2021,"Hey friends! 

First and foremost, in case you didn't see it, Budget Air is pushing an AeroMexico deal that got me roundtrip from SLC&gt;LIM for **$267.** No idea about other departure hubs, but I'd imagine it's not JUST for SLC, so yeah. Don't say you weren't told. 

Anywho, I've got essentially a full week in Peru (something like 9 days to pad travel and have an actual, full week) for May of 2021. 

I have done some decent research and basically came to the idea that I should do a 60/40 or 70/30 ish time split between Cusco and Lima, with Cusco getting more time. 

Of COURSE, I want to see Machu Picchu, and I do love the outdoors in my own right (I currently live in Salt Lake) but that will probably be a 1-2 day thing for me, rather than the full 4-5 day Inca Trail. 

I am a big fan of hostel life, nightlife (although I like local dives more than clubs), and just generally interesting places to wander. Do you think my split is appropriate? I've heard Lima can be underwhelming, and was considering not bothering for more than a full day or so and just heading right over to Cusco and surrounding. Basically, making it a trip to Cusco with a layover in Lima.  

Any hostel recommendations, general thoughts on the itinerary, etc.?

**Tl;dr possible itinerary:**

Travel days excluded\*  
Day 1: Lima exploration and lots of food, night out

Day 2: Basically the same

Day 3: Leave for Cusco and explore area around my hostel

Day 4: Machu Picchu 

Day 5: Maybe MP again or more Cusco hangs

Day 6: One of the day trips around Cusco 

Day 7: Back to Lima, hang out until flight the next day.

Doing it again later on...,"Hey,

When I was 25 I went travelling with my girlfriend of the time to Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, India, Sri Lanka and Nepal for a yearlong trip. I cycled through most of SE Asia and hitchiked through Malaysia. 

6 years on and I got married and had a baby as I always planned to do. That trip has changed me forever though and I still think of something from it every day. Never has there been another year in my life which I can remember so well.

Anyway I plan to retire at 55 and I have told my wife from the start that I plan to go away to do some proper travelling again. We often take city breaks in Europe together and we visit her home country of Japan once a year or so. 

Her idea of a great holiday is the perfect hotel room and complete comfort. I want to see more chaos and dirt.

I am considering cycling through South America or maybe getting a motorbike and doing more or perhsps just travelling to all those far flung places with a backpack.

I guess my question is do you think this is a morally OK thing to do? My daughter will be in her twenties and my wife is very independent, I was also thinking she could meet me for breaks in some countries.

My other question is, what is it like travelling at that age? I am very into keeping fit and if luck is on my side hopefully I will still have my health at that age. What is it really like being the old guy at the hostel?

"Nagging Thought - Making it work with moving out, working etc...","Currently planning a year long trip (hopefully) as soon as everything gets back to normal. I'm 25, currently earning £18,000 a year, and living at home with my family. Doing a lot of travelling is a big goal of mine but I also don't want to stay at home any longer; I want to be independent.

However, I'm grappling with the idea of having to choose - I feel like moving out is a commitment (even though I've been to uni before) that will impede my ability to travel to the extent that I want to. I want this long trip then to have the ability to travel frequently as well but I've got nagging thoughts about it like   
\- What about paying rent I'm away, urely I won't be able to afford both?  
\- I could just move back with family briefly around travelling but if I move out i can't keep just going back and forth,  
\- If I just fuck it, move out and go travelling for a while, then come back, will I just be able to move back with friends again or will I need to move back with family?  
\- What about all my stuff?  


I know these arent HUGE problems; I'm gonna go travelling and that's that, and to an extent I feel a bit stupid as these just seem like, first world problems, but it is a weird time this age I feel. i feel like I'm being pulled in different directions while also running out of time and freedom before 'real life' kicks in.

Which was the laxest and strictest border crossing?,"**Laxest border crossing** (discounting the places without formal border control eg Schengen): 

For me it's the La Linea crossing into Spain. Inside the border post there were a set of automated gates, and a manual counter. I instinctively went to the automated gates, thinking that like a normal border post these would be faster, only to find they are not turned on. Only then did I notice everyone was going to the manual counter. I went up and tried to hand over my passport. The official glanced at the cover, didn't even take it, and waved me through. :o

**Strictest border crossing:**

Macau by far. I got a pat-down search by officials before I boarded the ferry, this was even stricter than flying, so I had a feeling things wouldn't be easy.

And I was right, as soon as I stepped off the ferry, I got taken into a holding room. Three or four officials started questioning me: what are you doing here, where did you go before, how much cash I had on me (and can they photograph the cash?), what are the names and occupation of my parents, where will I be staying etc etc. They asked to see my travel photos and my social media apps.

After a round of questioning they took me into a second holding room, with a dozen other people awaiting processing.  Some of these people were deported while I waited so I was nervous I would be too. After a very nerve wracking hour they finally took me to the immigration counter to have my passport processed.

Debating 3 Mexican cities,"I’m traveling to CDMX for 5 days. I just love CDMX just so much to do but I’ve always wanted to visit a “Pueblo Mágico” I have narrowed it down to 3 cities driving distance away from CDMX. 

Cholula, Puebla

Taxco Guerrero 

There’s so much hype on San Miguel De Allende but the videos and seen the only thing that people seem to talk about is about the Parroquia that’s prominent building there. 

Cholula has the pyramid and all the churches.

Then I want to cross the border to Belize and be there like 4 days, then Guatemala for 3 days, Honduras for 4 days and finally Nicaragua for 3 days. From Nicaragua I would fly again to my country.

Mexico - Dia de Muertos 2021,"Usually this time of year I try to flee my cold and dark home here in Europe to somewhere sunny and warm. Since this years plans got canceled by the pandemic I thought I'd get a head start on next year - in the hope that we've got everything under control by then.

Mexico has been on top of my to-go list for some time now, so I started to plan the following trip for the end of October/beginning of November:

* Mexico City: 5 Days, including a day trip to Teotihuacán
* Puebla: 2 Days
* Oaxaca: 4 Days, during the festivities

 

I'm planning on traveling domestically by bus, are there any other stops along my route you would suggest? Are two days in Puebla too little time? Also, if you have recommendations on where to stay in those places I'd be glad to hear them!

As for Dia de Muertos in Oaxaca, I found a trip on G-Adventures which covers that part of my trip and would also add a few days in Puerto Escondido. Since it's very reasonably priced and I've also read some positive reviews on G-Adventures on here I'm thinking about booking that. If anyone here traveled with them in Mexico I'd be happy about some reviews.

Finally a somewhat cultural question. Where I'm from All Saints Day is a rather private holiday. You visit the graves of family and friends, which have been decorated the days before, but it would be rather strange to have tourists there. From what I've read online that's quite different for Dia de Muertos - as long as you behave and dress accordingly it's fine to visit the graveyards. Any locals or people that have been in Mexico for Dia de Muertos here that wanna chime in? I just want to make sure I don't offend anyone while I'm there.

"8,000 miles in 2 weeks","In April of next year, I have to drive to Tucson for some work/business purposes. So assuming a baseline, I will have to drive to Arizona and back at the bare minimum for this trip. I have wanted to do a long solo road trip across the US landscapes for some time. I have enough vacation days to take approximately 10-11 days off on top of 3-4 days for my work in Tucson. So assuming that, I will have about 2 weeks to do this trip give or take a few days. My estimates say that just the driving part of this trip will take 120-150 hrs. So I will budget a week for just driving. That leaves me with the other week for my work in Tucson and any stops I make, so it will probably be a split of 3-4 days in Tucson and 3-4 days of sightseeing in various cities/parks across the US for a combined total of 7 days of non-driving. This trip from end to end will be roughly 8,000 miles. I will be driving to Arizona no matter what due to work, but I would like to see more of the western US by road as it is meant to be seen. The longest drive I have done before is Tampa-El Paso-Tampa so this will be quite a bit longer than that. I am fully aware that this trip will be very tolling on the body, but it should also be the adventure of a lifetime. This will be a solo trip by car with just me and my Toyota.

Tucson-Phoenix

Phoenix-Grand Canyon

Grand Canyon-Los Angeles

Los Angeles-San Francisco

San Francisco-Sacramento

Sacramento-Lake Tahoe

The routes for example like Liverpool-Chester-Birmingham or some small routes like Birmingham-Bridgnorth. Travelling by rail seem to be quite a good pn shorter routes (Return on the same day ticket what a great idea!) But they start be quite expensive on longer routes at least for my home country standards. If You have any tips for travelling by rail I would really appreciate them. As for other ways like Buses I have no idea at all but heard they are cheaper and of course can get You where there's no railway. There are of course car rent companies which I consider as well (of course that's not public transport) but Haven't found any which will allow me to use their cars (I'm 21 with driving license for 3 years). Of course for in case of places worth visit in earlier mentioned area I will be happy to hear Your Suggestions both linked with my mentioned interests and not. For now I wish You and  to Your Loved ones to stay strong and healthy through this hard times.",solotravel,Kirjokerttu

Visiting India,"I saw some negative experiences from people visiting India. As an Indian now living in the US, here are my two cents that I believe will make a trip to India much much better.

1. I do not recommend visiting the big metropolitan cities (Delhi, Mumbai) unless you are a foodie. They are unsafe and chaotic and hard to navigate. If you have an Indian friend then spend a couple days in ONE city with them and eat lots of food. If you like clubbing then hit up some clubs, because the Indian clubbing experience is unique and lots of fun. But make sure to go with a native friend who has experience. I am from Delhi. 

2. Visit the mountains in the north. Go trekking. If any of you want recommendations on hiking companies then feel free to DM me.

3. Visit the south, I highly recommend the backwaters in Kerala.

4. Visit Rajasthan, a state with incredibly unique culture with everything from architecture, food, music and clothing. But do NOT visit the big cities like Jaipur. They aren’t worth it. 

5. Hit up some national parks. I recommend Kaziranga, Gir national park etc. 

6. The northeast is beautiful and you will never find culture like you find in certain places there, like Shillong and Nagaland. 

7. Continue on to Nepal or Bhutan.

Edit: I love the big cities in India. I love the chaos, the architecture, the food, everything. However it can be overwhelming and even dangerous for a solo traveler who doesn’t have an Indian companion. I’d like to add that as a woman I never go out alone even though I grew up in Delhi.

Edit 2: I didn’t expect so many people to read this! I’d I’d known I’d have gone into more detail. Thank you to all the folks in the comments who did that! Apologies if some of what I said came off as negative- I was really just trying to respond to people on this sub who described why they didn’t like the big cities in earlier threads.",solotravel,ivyraveneve

Study Abroad Solo (Budapest),"Hello, I am going to be studying abroad next year and was wondering if anyone has experience with an extended solo trip like that. I am planning on going to Budapest and will probably be living in student housing or apartments but will not know anyone on the trip beforehand. 

I have some experience traveling solo in Western Europe, but only a week or so at a time. I have plans on using Budapest as a home base and use this opportunity to see Eastern Europe. Any recommendations on having fun in Budapest are welcomed. I'm a little worried about going so long away from my friends. Are the people you meet solo enough human interaction for this long (4-5 months)? Is it easy to meet people as an American college student in Eastern Europe?

5000 km (25 day) road trip through TURKEY in 2021 [ITINERARY REVIEW],"Not sure about the exact timeline of this trip for obvious reasons, but in 2021 I intend to go all around Turkey and visit a lot of major historical sites on the way

I used Rome2Rio to get a rough idea of how I will make this trip around Turkey starting at Istanbul and ending at Istanbul. My planned trip will be around 25 days (my visa will only be valid for 30 days max due to my nationality), but if you count up the days in my itinerary, you'll notice they  add up to 20-23 days. Transportation doesn't seem to be the most reliable in Eastern Turkey, and based on previous experiences in the Balkans, I am expecting to miss a few connections and spend a few extra nights at someplaces. I am trying to avoid flights but will take one if absolutely necessary (I am not near Istanbul the end of the trip). This probably looks like a LOT for a month, but I have traveled at this pace before and I sleep like a baby in overnight transportation, so I don't usually get tired from fast-paced trips

# Where I need help/suggestions

1. If you see my route going past a cool spot that I haven't listed, please let me know, and I will see if I can squeeze it into the itinerary
2. If you see any of my plans based on false assumptions about transport/places that are not open, please correct me
3. If you have any experience traveling between cities in **Eastern Turkey**, suggestions/pointers on transport and accommodation will be highly appreciated
4. If anyone knows about the visa-process of taking a ferry to Northern Cyprus, would appreciate input on that. I will have a single entry Turkish visa so wouldn't wanna visit Northern Cyprus if I can't get back into Turkey. I haven't included it in the itinerary because it looks too confusing
5. If there are things I am not sure about, I have highlighted questions in **bold**

In need of some encouragement,"I have been working for many years to make one of my childhood dreams, to solo travel the world, a possibility. As I get closer to achieving that I am starting to feel insurmountably discouraged, and hoping the community here can remind me why this is a worthwhile effort in the first place.

I started school at 20 having worked in retail through the worst of the ‘08 recession and wanting a better life. I graduated at 25 with $80k in student loan debt, and started working my ass off to have some hope of paying that off so I could travel before I get too old. Now at 30, I am actually six months away from being debt free!

However these 10 years have taken much more of an emotional and physical toll than I wanted. I paid my loans by working my ASS off at a very corporate Fortune 500 company, moving every year or two to live at our construction sites. My hair is falling out and I am becoming increasingly sad every year that I make a group of friends only to leave them behind when I move to the next project. All of my coworkers are very conservative people who have hardly left the USA, let alone as free-wheeling solo travelers, so whenever I bring up my dreams I just sound like a crazy child. Everybody around me just asks why don’t I buy a house, worry about my credit score and 401k, etc.

I just can’t ignore how positive my travel experiences have been. I find myself an infinitely more compassionate, thoughtful, and patient person when I am free on the road. My ‘fantasy’ is to solo travel indefinitely, without any sort of schedule or agenda and understand the world outside of the constructs imposed on us. I would like to redefine my life outside of the confines of the corporate world and the ‘American dream’.

Also I am really not confident I want to live or raise children in the USA. This has been an incredibly difficult place to be a middle class person and I don’t want my children to be preyed on by moneyed interests the way I have been. I believe that many places in the world are actually much more ‘free’ and I want to open my eyes to that.",solotravel,oaklicious

Me. My dog. And my Honda Civic. Feb-May 2021,"I work for Amazon (totally remote, flexible hours). I relocated to Seattle in March 2020 just as everything started to shut down. I’ve never stepped foot in the office, I haven’t made many friends, and yet I’m paying $2000+ in rent just to be near a workplace that is still locked down.

So here is my idea. My lease is up in February 2021. I have plenty of income. Why not pick a few of these ~$1500/month all inclusive AirBNB places around the country while working remote and solo travel from place to place? It would still be cheaper than the rent in Seattle.

"Trip report: Three trips in New South Wales, Australia","I usually take an overseas holiday each year, but that's legally prohibited for Australians for the foreseeable future due to the pandemic. Instead, I made three road trips around the state of New South Wales from my home town of Canberra over August and September. I'm posting a trip report to share my experiences for the interest of other Australians.

**Trip 1: Canberra to Dubbo**

I took two weeks off in August, with plans to spend most of this time in Sydney. However, due to a COVID outbreak in Sydney at the time, the Australian Capital Territory Government strongly advised Canberrans to avoid the city and holiday in areas of NSW with no COVID cases. As a result, I booked a two day trip to the regional city of Dubbo, which is best known for being home to the vast Western Plains Zoo (the sister zoo to the famous Taronga Zoo in Sydney), and left the next day.

This was my first solo road trip anywhere, and I really enjoyed the experience. The drive to Dubbo was lengthy, but very scenic. I stopped in at Cowra, where I had my first cafe lunch since March and visited the remnants of the World War II prisoner of war camp (not very interesting) and the Japanese cemetery (fascinating).

I spent almost all of the next day at Western Plains Zoo, which was fantastic. Unfortunately due to COVID restrictions the keeper talks and animal feeding sessions had been cancelled, but there were good video versions of the keeper talks for about half of the displays. I drove home the next day via Parkes, where I visited the famous radio telescope (aka 'The Dish') and had the largest hamburger I've ever eaten for lunch.

Overall, this was a fantastic trip. I really wished that I'd allocated at least another couple of days to it to visit more of the towns in this region as there was a lot to see.

**Trip 2: Canberra to Wollongong**

With COVID advisories still in place for Sydney, I decided to spend some of the next week of my leave in the largest city in the world Canberrans were able to freely visit at the time: the coastal city of Wollongong! (population 300,000).

I drove up via the pretty coastal town of Kiama, where it's blowhole was in fine form due to heavy seas. I spent the afternoon walking around Wollongong's spectacular beach and charmless business district.

I spent the next morning at the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society's facilities at an airport to the south of Wollongong. This was much better than I was expecting, as all visitors are given a guided tour (largely for OH&amp;S reasons) and it had a huge collection of well maintained planes. Some of the aircraft visitors are usually able to enter were unavailable due to social distancing restrictions, but I was able to tour their ex-Qantas Boeing 747. After lunch I visited the Nan Tien Temple, which is one of the largest Buddhist temples in Australia - it was huge, but not terribly interesting.

This was also a fun trip. Two days was about enough though.

**Trip 3: Canberra to Sydney**

In September the advisory against visiting Sydney was eased when case numbers dropped to very low levels, so I took half a week off and headed up there. As Canberra hadn't had any COVID cases for months and there is almost no use of face masks (with the local government not requiring this in any circumstances), visiting Sydney was a novelty in that the NSW Government was strongly encouraging people to wear face marks on public transport and other places where maintaining social distancing was difficult.

I spent much of my time visiting family, but also rattled around the city. Take-up of face masks seemed to be at around 50% on public transport and lower levels in most other places. Several art galleries I visited were very strongly encouraging visitors to wear marks. I wore mine whenever I was in public transport, cramped shops and at other locations where doing so was requested or seemed sensible. The absence of foreign tourists was very noticeable, and depressing, with Circular Quay and the Opera House area being almost deserted in the middle of the day.

I also enjoyed this trip. The COVID restrictions were sensible, and were working well.

**Conclusions**

These three trips really helped me to get my confidence back regarding travelling outside of Canberra and eating in cafes and restaurants following our lockdown period. It was possible to enjoy the trips while still following COVID safe practices. Contingent on COVID case numbers remaining very low, I'm looking forward to further travel around Australia now that most of the internal border restrictions have been eased or removed.",solotravel,Appropriate_Volume
My first solo travel experience!!!,"First solo travel experience!!

Hey guys I just wanted to chime in and talk about the trip I went on this past weekend! 

With Covid going on it’s been a pretty dull year so far but I wanted to try and do something safely. I live in NJ and decided to drive to Virginia to go camping in the Shenandoah valley. While down there I visited the Luray caverns which I must say were absolutely beautiful and I fell in love with Shenandoah National park. 

This was the first solo trip I ever went on! On top of that this is the first time I’ve ever gone camping too! I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t anxious and nervous approaching it. I was a little scared that I would end up not liking it and just sucking it up telling people it was great. 

My experience truly was incredible! I finally understand all the love and hype for solo travel that I’ve been looking into for months. I felt so at peace the entire time. It was such a good feeling knowing everything I was doing, was literally what I wanted to do. There were no arguments about what to do or any of the other typical situations with group trips. 

I’m so excited for things to improve in the world so I can travel a little more openly and start this solo travel journey! 

I love all of your posts in this sub, they truly make me excited for what is out there. 

Also before the negativity comes in with traveling during Covid. I actually took a Rapid test today which came back negative and I am quarantining until my PCR test results come back!

How do you deal with your family back home?,"I’m sure majority of people here are around the ages of 18-35, some probably even older. I’m in my 20s, and come from a family where we are all really close. All my brothers and parents live in the same city and see each other frequently.  I solo travelled once, it was for a 2 voluntary day work conference in London, and I decided to stay instead for a week so I can have fun afterwards. I was always interested in being to a new country alone and thought this was the perfect opportunity to start. My parents were very uneasy with me going alone, they wanted my brothers to come with me. My brothers never solo travelled either, only trips they taken were family trips. It was a battlefield trying to convince them that I needed this for work (even though it was voluntary but I made it seem like it was a must) and since my brothers weren’t able to just get up and come with me, my parents finally accepted. While I was in London my mom was practically texting me throughout the day and we talked on the phone every night. When I came back my dad told me in secret that that week was the most he’s ever seen my mom stressed out, but that he was proud that I got a new city experience lol

"3ish Month Trip, Need Suggestions Given The Following Situation","I appreciate any thoughts. The post is long, but I wanted to give context.

Background: Late 20s Male. Mech eng, former US service member(lived and traveled overseas). 1800/month passive income. No expenses. No debt. At or above US averages for my age in cash and in 401k. 

The Situation: In the next few weeks I'll be negotiating a raise that I believe I deserve and discussing my future at the company long term. I don't want to get bogged down too much on these details, but the important part is I live in NJ and if significant raises or promotions don't seem likely in the next 5 years then I'm bailing on NJ due to the cost of living. 

The Question Preface: If this scenario plays out(seems likely) and covid has died down a bit by Spring/Summer 2021 I would like to take my time in finding a new job. My criteria for a new location leaves the vast majority of the US open. My thinking is whether I am in NJ or any other place with internet I can work on finding a job and applying, plus after my lease is up I'll have nowhere to live(I'm getting rid of pretty much everything I own"")

The Actual Question: Where can I live(outside US) for 1800 usd/month? I'd dip into savings if I wanted to do day trips etc. 

Requirements: Costal. Reliable internet. Not completely off grid, but not in the heart of a major city"". Need a private room. Hostel is fine, but private room required. Car not required. 

Research thus far: I've found a lot of the ""10 cheapest places to retire"" lists have been a good start. 

Cascais, Portugal- Has anyone been here? It seems nearly too good to be true. I like the fact that I'm in easy train shot to Lisbon and could walk from my room to the beach, supermarket, downtown. 

Cartagena, Colombia- I'm struggling to research if there is a suburb with easy access to the city. I don't really want to be ""in-in"" the city or any major city. Any experience anyone?

Mancora, Peru- The articles surrounding here either talk about it being a big party town or sleepy town, I'm assuming it is seasonal, any thoughts?

Typical day- I wake up and grab a local coffee/espresso with a light walk. Go back to my room, research jobs, areas, and tailor resumes for 2-4 hours. Eat lunch then go for a rigorous workout. Explore local area, read at the beach maybe get involved in some sort of group activity or learning(language, yoga, painting).

Typical Friday/Saturday- Enjoy the local bar playing music, maybe there are vacationers or expats or locals I can chat with over a beer. I'm fine with partying, but I'm not looking for a Cancun/Ibiza spring break deal.

Sunday- Take public transport to check out whatever.

The purpose of this trip is to unwind, plan, enjoy, and help me decide what I want.

TL;DR Budget of \~$5,000 trying to stretch across three months seeing as much as possible while hitting some spots to paintball along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Solo Travelers, 

OK so I am starting to get a little overwhelmed while planning this trip. That's why I've come to this great community for help!

So I may be planning this a little early but I'm trying to get my ducks in a row for this upcoming summer. I have roughly $5000 maybe $7000 to spend on this trip and I'm trying to make it last for as close to 3 months as possible. 

This will be my first trip outside the U.S. so I hope to see as many places without being extremely rushed. That's why I'm shooting for a 3 month time frame. I also hope to hit a few of the paintball places on the map above. I think it would be really cool to paintball in a few different countries along the way.

I hope to pack as light as possible and hit hostels/couch surf almost the whole way. Along with the paintball stops I hope to stop in Istanbul and Slovakia to meet up with some friends. 

So I guess my question is how to I proceed to make a coherent plan where I'm able to paintball, meet my buddies, hit a few major ""attractions"", and explore local villages while staying on budget and staying as long as possible?

Thanks for all the help!

Do you keep tidy or go caveman mode when traveling ?,"I am balding and have a small beard. So I bring along a head shaver and a beard trimmer.  Takes up a bit of space but I feel better that way.

Same can be said of women. I have met girls on the road who stopped shaving their legs and armpits while others stayed real neat and well kept. I especially remember meeting a girl Iceland who was  hitchking around the island. Apparently she didn't shower for days and you could really smell her. She was perfectly fine with that. Other girls brought along tons of personnal hygiene stuff in their backpacks and looked like they just came out of a beauty parlor.",solotravel,BlueBuff1968

First Time Travel - Mexico City,"I'm about to take a 8-10 day solo trip to Mexico City (I'm from the US) and I'm looking for suggestions on things to do. I'm feeling a little anxious, but I'm very excited. Some more information below.

**Places I've Travelled To:**

Domestic around the US to big cities and rural areas. I love everything from rural PA to downtown Chicago.

**Length:**

8-10 days

**Budget:**

I've been saving for a while, all in I wouldn't mind spending $3k (including flights/hotels)

**Interests:**

Sightseeing, nature, museums, tourist attractions, eating local Mexican food, walking/boat tours, partying. Someone recommended teotihuacan, and that looks right up my alley. My loose plan is to sight see/try new places to eat during the day and go out at night.

**Accommodation:**

I was originally considering staying in a hostel (Hostal Regina Centro Historico), but that's not the smartest idea so I'll most likely do AirBnB or hotel. Will tinder be good for meeting people? **Are there any must see places if you're in Mexico City?**

Thanks everyone!

EDIT: The trip was a blast and I'm so glad I went. A lot of places were closed, but enough spots were open to still have an amazing trip. There's touristy things to do during the day and nightlife at night if you know/meet the right people.",solotravel,1stTimeTravels

instant oats, granola bars, bread, peanut butter, jelly, fruit and precut veggies.

Any tips on what to expect at the airport for a transatlantic flight right now?,"Hi everyone! I haven’t travelled at all since, well, you know what, but I’m going on a seven hour transatlantic flight on Tuesday and wondering what should I expect.

What do y’all think the chances are that the flight will be fully booked? Are airplanes doing anything to socially distance or is that over on flights? My ticket says there is still a meal, does that mean everyone’s going to be taking their masks off during the meal? If it helps, I’m flighting out of Toronto Pearson.

How to plan travel around meeting locals and other travelers?,"So I see lots of posts here with folks mentioning things like visiting a new country for, say, a month, and making local friends with whom they still stay in contact. Or getting invited into a local's home for tea and dinner. Or spending the day with a local, or exploring with other travelers, etc.

I'm wondering how people find themselves in these situations? One of my favorite things when traveling is meeting locals and just hearing about their perspective; I feel like I come away from it with a deeper understanding of the place I just visited.

I also enjoy meeting fellow travelers for similar reasons, just to learn about their experiences and, I suppose, expose myself to a more diverse array of people than I would meet here in the US.

The problem with me is I'm fairly introverted. I'm not shy per se, and will try to strike up others in a hostel, for example, but if I sense a cold reception on their part then I get discouraged and withdraw, not wanting to bother them.

On top of this, I usually plan my day around visiting cool landmarks, sites, restaurants, etc. but this activity isn't super conductive to meeting others, because it feels weird to be at a temple, for example, and cold approach a stranger to just start conversing with no context. 

So far, this has been my experience, where the people I reach out to seem to not care to have anything to do with me, whether that be a group of travelers fine on being amongst themselves, or locals who don't want to interact with a foreigner.

I try and respect their space in these cases, but I can't help but wonder how people on this sub end up having such rich experiences with those they meet traveling? How do you plan your trips, and orient your daily activities, lodging, etc. to facilitate the process of meeting new people as much as possible?",solotravel,TheAbLord
I have six months to travel,"If all goes well, I'm starting university in September 2021. In January I'm quitting my job and I want to travel. I've got six months. I've got a European passport and I plan to use it.

I don't know whether to 

1 travel to a country e.g. Sweden and try to get a job for those six months. This would be ideal if any of the swedish universities I've applied to accepts me. The other plus is that I get to make more money than I spend. However it's probably shitty of me to get a job and quit six months in right?

2 going backpacking through europe. I'd choose maybe six countries and do workaways for a month at a time. I'm very worried I'll spend too much money though. Plus if I get accepted into one of the most expensive universities Ive applied to Ill probably have to skip this adventure and use all my money to cover tuition and living costs.

What was your most memorable trip in pre-COVID 2019-2020 and what specifically would you recommend to your friends or solo travellers?,"Hey everyone,

Since not a lot of us are current travelling at the moment, thought it might be nice to reminisce about a recent travel experience while also helping to share some recommendations for people planning to travel there in the future.

**What was a memorable trip that you recently took? Are there any specific places or activities that stood out that you'd highlight to other travellers?**

I'll start! One of my favourite trips was to **Kauai, Hawaii**. I love being in the outdoors and so the activities here were perfectly suited for that. I haven't been to the other islands, but had such a great experience here I might just want to come back.

* **Transportation**: The entire island is extremely small; however, in order to make the most of it, it is highly recommended that you rent a car. This will allow you to drive to parts of the island in 1-2h. Although I would have loved to get a Jeep - you really don't need one (unless you're going to some off-road terrain) and can save money by renting a regular car.
* **Food**: Really enjoyed lots of food trucks and snacks! Recommend:
   * **The Fish Express**: This was the best poke I had (tried several locations, and only found this on the last day).
   * **Trucking Delicious**: Delicious coconut shrimp
   * **Wailua Shave Ice**: Shave ice was great here (and its different than the regular shaved ice you think of at carnivals /snowcones).
   * **Java Kai**: Think smoothie bowls and avo toast.
* **Activities:**
   * **Hiking:** Tons of great trails with all different types of scenery and lengths. Check out AllTrails app.
   * **Surfing:** I'm an absolute beginner and went to the south area (since I was advised against going to the north during the Winter season). There was a nice area next to the Sheraton which was beginner friendly. Didn't want to take a lesson since I'd taken one before and just wanted to mess around with a board. **Kauai Surf School** (I think) rented boards for $10/h. :) Am sure there were other areas where you could also rent a board but I liked that this was on the water and you could easily see where other people were trying to catch waves.",solotravel,TravoShare
"After two months of recuperation from a TBI, I am finally resuming my travels again","My flight departs tomorrow at 7AM, bound for the other side of the continent. I cannot contain my elation.

Time is short and you never know what is going to happen with your life. The accident that caused my TBI came out of nowhere. If had happened a second later, I probably would've died.

West Highland Way in Spring of 2021?,"Hey everyone! I (20F) am currently in school, but will have a break between this current school and my next during May-June of 2021. My mom has mentioned the West Highland Way in Scotland before to me, and I’d LOVE to be able to go and walk it.

"I'm considering taking a year off to travel, how can I best prepare myself financially","I (24m) really really want to take 12-18 months off - probably starting in 2022 but thats all dependant on a number of factors right now including covid.

I have around 15k in RRSP, 2k in TFSA, and another 40K in savings. I have no debts, no mortgage and no car. I earn roughly 80k per year currently.

I know what I want to do is a terrible financial decision especially considering the lost earrings, but I want to do it regardless. 

Basically my question is: I've got atleast 1 year to prepare myself and to minimise the impact to my financial health due to not earning an income for such a long time. I don't intend to end up broke after all of this - infact im hoping to only spend 15-20k during my travels but i haven't sat down and done the maths, i just pulled that number out of my ass...What should I be doing in preparation for this trip and what should i be doing while im travelling.",solotravel,skinnybg
"After COVID, I want to quit my job and solo travel long-term. Am I crazy?","I graduated college last year in May. I’ve been working full time since and have saved up about $45k. By the time COVID is over and travel is fully opened and welcomed again, I estimate I can grow that to around $60-75k depending on how long it takes. 
 
I’m 25 M. I have a decent job making around $50k/yr. Can double my salary if I stay with the company for another 5 years. But I hate it. I don’t hate the company, I don’t hate the people, I don’t hate the job. I hate feeling like I’m wasting my life sitting in an office doing things that I don’t want to be doing.

All I have ever been told in life is go to school, get a good job, buy a house, get married, and have kids.

I have a college education, I have a good job, I rent my own house, I have a beautiful girlfriend. And yet, I’m certainly not satisfied. The only thing I’m missing is the kids, and I don’t want any, but I’m pretty confident a child won’t make me happy either. 

I want to explore the world beyond the suburbs that my great grandparents, grandparents, parents and now myself have lived and worked in our entire lives. I want to experience different cultures and see new perspectives. I want to explore something bigger than myself. I want to overcome my fears and anxiety. I want to develop and grow into a stronger individual. I want to learn to love myself fully and be comfortable alone. Solo travel seems to satisfy all of these. Right? 

It’s so easy to get comfortable. Then before you know it, 15 years go by, you are 40 years old with kids, a wife, a mortgage. You are no longer living for yourself. You live to support others. There’s nothing wrong with this lifestyle if it makes you happy. 

I am at a very crucial point in my life where I need to decide which road I am going to take. 

I’m still young, I have no kids, the only debt I have is 20k in student loans ($250/monthly), I rent, my car is paid for, I have a good amount of savings. One or many of these things may change in the next 5 years. 

So I ask from anyone who has taken the jump, can you please share your wisdom and experience? How much money did you have saved up when you left? What is/was your long-term game plan after cash reserves dry up? How long are you going to live the lifestyle and what is the plan after? Where did you go? Can you give me any advice specific to my situation? 

Would you do it all over again?

EDIT: This post turned into great discussion and I truly appreciate everyone’s kind words and motivation. I really needed it. I want to thank everyone for their input. It has been invaluable to me. 

After reading a majority of the comments, I want to address a few of the most asked questions: 

1. Why haven’t you paid off your student loan debt? 

I’ve heavily considered it. I decided not to because the interest rates are low (3.5%). All federal loans. Meaning, I could invest the same amount of money that I would use to pay it off, earn 7% interest in the market, and profit the 3.5% spread. BUT if I’m going to be traveling long-term, I really don’t want to deal with it or have to worry about it at all. So I will more than likely pay it off before I leave. 

2. Is my girlfriend coming with me?

No. My girlfriend is awesome, don’t get me wrong. But this is something I need to do alone. Our relationship is still new. We aren’t on the cusp of getting married or anything. And she knows this is something I am considering. I’ve been transparent from the start. 

3. How did I save so much in that amount of time? 

Zero expenses. Well not zero, but pretty damn close. I was living with my dad for 17 of the past 18 months after I graduated. I just started renting at the beginning of this month. I paid nothing in rent, nothing in utilities, student loans have been deferred due to COVID, I own my car. The only expenses I had were my phone bill, car insurance, and whatever food/activities I wanted to spend money on. This allowed me to save almost all of my income. I also worked for my dad occasionally to earn some extra cash whenever I could. I realize not everyone has this opportunity. I am forever grateful that I did.

4. Can you work remotely? Is your industry easy to get back into? 

Yes and yes. My job can be done 100% remotely and there are plenty of companies in this industry that I could seek employment from with my experience. Unfortunately, my boss is old fashioned and conservative in his ways and wants everyone in the office 5 days a week. 

That being said, and with all of the helpful advice and wise words people have given me, I have laid out a new game plan:

Continue working and saving for at least the next year. This will allow me to build up more experience, put away some more cash into my reserve fund, and pay off my loans. I’ll be able to stick it out for another year. Hopefully by then COVID will have passed and people will be welcoming of foreign travelers again. 

I will then propose to my boss that I continue working for the company on a part time basis 100% remotely so I can travel and have some of my time back. If he declines, I quit and travel on my reserve cash for awhile keeping expenses low and living frugally. 

Once I need to start making an income again, I will look for a 100% remote position in my current industry. It shouldn’t be hard to find. If that doesn’t work, I will use some of the other great tips in this thread for making an income while traveling like online tutoring or teaching english.

I’m sorry I was not able to respond to many of you. I have been busy with work (ironic lol). Hopefully this update will be sufficient. Thank you again to everyone who commented and for your kind words! You truly have made this decision so much easier. The leap does not seem nearly as intimidating after hearing all of the great stories about how it worked out for people and how they did not regret it for a second. 

Much love everyone! May we all satisfy our deepest desires and live a life of fulfillment and meaning!",solotravel,LifeQuestionsMe
I need a break in the UK,"I'm a PhD student just entering my second year. I'm doing some teaching but it's conducted 100% online, and my area is basically philosophy, so as long as I have my laptop and Kindle I can basically work from anywhere.

The last few months have been... shit, to say the least. My dad suffered a spinal injury affecting his mobility, was sent a cancer screening test, my mum was diagnosed with a heart condition, my partner of 4.5 years' father had a stroke, my brother lost his job, I had to move out of my flat near the university because I couldn't find affordable nearby accommodation, and I'm now meant to be doing teaching and research at the same time. All the while, I can't travel to Vienna and live there for a few months as I hoped to - so the alternative is probably somewhere here in the UK.

I need a break. I need to get away somewhere quiet and beautiful, with some nice cafes I can just read or write on my laptop, some pubs to get a pint in the evening, and nature so I can get some fresh air and just get away from all my worries. The thing is, I don't know where to go. I've always wanted to spend some time in Edinburgh, but Airbnb doesn't show anything remotely affordable for me. I was hoping to spend maybe 3 weeks away somewhere new and different, maybe spend about £500 on accommodation. But I'm not sure where to go. I'd love to spend some more time in the lovely Yorkshire villages, but I just don't know where to go.

Does anyone have any recommendations? I'm not sure whether I should be looking on Airbnb or [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) or hostelworld or something else.

Might be worth mentioning that I don't drive but I'm very happy to get a train. And I'll probably be based in York by the time I can realistically do this.

I'd really appreciate anyone's help or advice on this one.",solotravel,unevenclimate
To be Solo Travellers - ever worry if you've completely romanticised the idea of solo travel and maybe you'll find one day its not for you?,"This is a worry I have a lot. I haven't had the means and opportunity yet to just take the leap with solo travel and see if its everything I've ever wanted. And dont get me wrong, despite my fears, I still definitely wish to do it as soon as I can. 

But I've been into the idea of solo travel for a really long time now; subscribed to here, read solo travel literature, watched vlogs etc and the whole idea is something thats always excited me. I've even influenced friends and coworkers who've had the means to go and do it and they've always been thankful. 

In general I enjoy solo activities like eating at nice restaurants alone, going to the cinema alone etc -- and yet I cant shake this feeling theres a chance I wouldn't enjoy solo travelling. The only travelling I'm use to is with friends and family. And now I'm just worried I've built up the idea of it so much, its not that it wont live up to my expectation, but that I wont enjoy it as much as if I had company. 

Not to be cheesy but this problem at some point reminded me of that one quote from Tangled: 

&gt; Rapunzel: I’ve been looking out of a window for eighteen years, dreaming about what I might feel like when those lights rise in the sky. What if it’s not everything I dreamed it would be?

&gt; Flynn Rider: It will be.

&gt; Rapunzel: And what if it is? What do I do then?

&gt; Flynn Rider: Well,that’s the good part I guess. You get to go find a new dream.

Which has provided me some hope that, as soon as I do take that first leap into solo travel, I'll find it intoxicating and will jump into another adventure. 

But I guess my question for the community is two:

1) are there any other 'to be solo travellers' who also lurk here and feel similarly?

2) and for people who have solo travelled and felt like this before, what were your first time solo travel experiences like?

Edit: thank you all so much! The responses have been overwhelming and you guys have been a massive help and comfort. So much practical advice and helpful antidotes &lt;3",solotravel,gkbbb
Trip planning for June 2021,"Hi everyone,

I  am considering going on a solo-backpacking trip in either June or July  2021 (assuming COVID blows over). So far I am looking at two regions:  Southeast Asia or South America. If I go to Southeast Asia I would like  to try and buy a motorcycle and take a month to month and a half long  trip through Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. If I go to South America, I was  thinking Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil. Any advice on  what to do, suggested routes, etc?

So far I have traveled to twenty countries and territories spanning North America, Europe, Far East, Central America, West Africa and the Caribbean. I am pretty experienced with travel in a variety of places from developed to undeveloped countries so I think I would do well in either region. I also speak decent Spanish but I do not know any Portuguese. Will that be a problem for South America? I have a month to a month and a half to work with (early June 2021 to mid July 2021) so I have enough time to get around either area I think. I should have a budget of a few thousand USD for this trip.

Any and all help or advice is appreciated.

Thank you for your time.",solotravel,JosephPMannion

"Tokyo, Japan advice?","Hi!

Next April, given corona virus is a bit less mad, I have to go to Tokyo for business.  
I'll be there for 3 days of work, where my flights/hotel will be sorted for me. But I've decided to take 5 days off and just stay for leisure. I'll have to pay for my hotel at this point so I think I'll change hotels if anyone has any decently priced suggestions! 

these aren't the actual dates but I find it easier to think like this :) 

Here is my plan:

1st - Get into Tokyo at 11:30 local time, travel to my hotel then spend the afternoon exploring the general area and getting food. I imagine I'll be super tired after a long travel day and to be back resting quite early given I'm working for a few days!

2nd -  Conference  
3rd - Conference  
4th - Conference  - with these days I imagine we may go out for drinks etc in the evening. We finish at around 6 - 7pm but I'll make no plans!

5th - Switch hotels, either my new hotel can keep my luggage (hotels in the UK do this) or I'll pay for a locker.  
Yoyogi park , Meiji shrine. Wander around Shibuya

6th - Seibu centre and Pokemon Center mega store, Animate store, Bandai building

7th - Odaiba, rainbow bridge, museum, general shopping in some cool stores there

8th - Disney Tokyo - I know, extremely touristy but theme parks are a joy for me. Spending a full day in Tivoli, Copenhagen is one of my fondest memories

9th - Flight at 1pm 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some concerns:**

I could stay another couple of days, the cost would be pretty minimal if I had a decently priced hotel. But I need to decide before next month when they book my flights

What car to buy for a year long US solo road trip?,"Good evening, I am a 24 year old male who just feels really lost and today I just put in my 2 weeks leaving a comfortable well pay job to go travel the US solo for some soul searching. 

I am in NYC right now and my plan is to sell my car and then drive west and hop around all the different ski resorts for the winter and then once winter ends go on a hugeeeee national park backpacking tour, spending 2–7 days at each place. Right now the highlights I am 100% going to see is glacier, Yellowstone, redwood, Tetons, arches, Zion, Yosemite, Joshua tree, Bryce cannon, grand canon, smoky mountains, and Acadia. I’m open to other suggestions too!

I’m looking for a car for this extensive trip and money is no concern. It has to handle really well in snow and the mountains and be comfortable for longgggg drives. I don’t need too much cargo room because I’m only bringing my backpacking set up and then probably a clone of it just in case equipment gets damaged or lost.

I know nothing about cars, but was thinking of getting either a fully loaded outback and probably some aftermarket rims and tires and a set of snow tires, or a Range Rover (my favorite car)  with some snow tires but I’ve heard iffy things regarding reliability. I’m open to all suggestions, thanks!",solotravel,WormBurner72
Solo hiking and camping,"Last week I did some solo hiking in the mountains near me. I was staying at a hostel near me which was great and I had people to talk to every night. I also enjoyed hiking alone because I could go my own speed. I even went to a winery tasting alone which was pretty nice too because I flirted with the waiter the whole time. 

However I didn't like eating alone at restaurants. And when I went for an overnight backpacking trip, I found that I don't enjoy camping alone. This was super surprising to me because I'm usually very reserved and I don't mind my own company. I live alone and never get lonely but if I go out to the woods, suddenly I'm wishing for conversation.

Budget: hostel: $33 a night. I made most of my meals. Gas to get there was probably my biggest expense.


Trip Length: 5 nights

Destination(s): New Hampshire white mountains.



Accommodation: The Notch Hostel. One of the best hostels I've stayed at.

Have you ever bottled up something bad that happened to you during solo traveling?,"Sorry if that’s a confusing title.

I’ve always loved to solo travel, but as a young women, my desire to do this was always met with skepticism and fear. My family discourages my traveling because they don’t believe it’s safe for a woman to travel alone. Before I left for my first trip, my mom called and begged me to reconsider, even offering to reimburse all the money I spent. I almost caved just because I hated how upset she was, but went through with it and had a great time. My friends think it’s odd and kinda dangerous as well but they’re supportive. 

Solo traveling opened up the world to me in such an incredible way and I fell in love with it. I also used every precaution to keep myself safe and it was always enough...until it wasn’t. I was sexually assaulted on my last trip to a European country that most would consider very safe. I’m ashamed to admit this, but I never reported the attack. It’s a long road to recovery, but I do believe that I’ve made a lot of progress in overcoming this. 

I still can’t bring myself to tell anyone I know about the attack. Not my parents. Not my best friend. Not even my current boyfriend (it occurred before we got together). Every time I try, it’s like my throat closes up and I physically cannot force the words out. I just don’t want them to know they were *right*. That the worst thing they warned me could happen actually happened. Despite everything, I do desperately want to conquer this and get back out into the world, but that’s still such a terrifying concept to me now. If I tell them, they’ll have all the ammo they’ll ever need to keep me ‘grounded’. It would just take a mention of the incident to have me canceling my flight. 

And reading over this, I realize it’s pretty heavy stuff for this sub. I’m sorry to dump it all out like that, but I needed to get it out somewhere, and I worried that any other forum would warn me against traveling solo ever again. I’m hoping no one else has ever been in a similar situation, but have you ever felt the same fear of telling people when your solo travels go wrong? And if your travels did go wrong, how did you build yourself up again to resume them?

"Some thoughts on Eurail pass usage in FR, DE, Austria area. Seeking experiences in Benelux/Spain/Italy/Poland/Nordic countries","Germans are meticulous when checking Eurail passes, French people seem to mainly not give a fuck.

Things that you can get away on French trains but not on German trains:

- Booking an interrail reservation instead of a eurail reservation to get into the French trains where gates check the codes in big stations like Paris East
- Conductors that check your pass maybe 1 in 4 trains you take.
- Conductors that look at the cover of your pass and don't open it
- Conductors that look at the journeys of your pass rather than the ""X days"" on the top of the pass that really counts when you have a pass that is say, 10 days out of a month
- Conductors that look at your reservation without looking at your eurail pass
- Conductors that are cool when you give them a eurail pass but never check that you have a reservation

The Austrian version of that is similar to the German version but less intense. My hypothesis is that Germany is a bigger supporter of the train passes (unified EU/economy reasons) while France is less supportive. I am curious as to whether there are differences between countries I would lump in such categories: strict (Germany/Austria/Benelux area?) and relaxed (France, Spain, Italy)",solotravel,minGeselleChumetNiet

[Report] 7 days in Catalunya after 4 months in Madrid (Sept 2019).,"A year ago, I took my first solo trip : a 7-days trip in Catalunya, Spain. Here's a report. It's been a year ago, so I might not remember every detail, sorry for that. 

I'll speak about my first days spent in Barcelona and how I managed to loose a friend there (F**k alcohol!). Then how I spent the rest of the days in different idylic little villages by myself, how I felt and how my feelings evolved. Also worth to say that end of september was a good period to go, as the weather was around the 25-30°C and there were not many tourists anymore (or at least outside of Barcelona).

Before going on that 7-days trip, I spent 4 months in Madrid for my work. This is not the main topic, but I'll write a few lines on it, because why not? I'll also use Madrid as point of comparison later. 

So, in May 2019 I was sent to Madrid for a 4 months mission to install the first Protontherapy center in Madrid. I really loved that city. The vibes, the architecture, the parks, ... really pleased me. I'd love to go back. I enjoyed it much more than Barcelona. 

There are so much things to see there, the Retiro Park with the Crystal Palace, the Prado Museum, all the nice buildings along Gran Via. If you can spend a few days there, I highly recommend.

The only thing I did not like so much there are the crowds and the heat. That goddammned heat. 47°C in full sun in july, still 36°C at 4am. Can't even go from one bar to another without getting all sweaty. 

Let's go to the Catalunya trip part now. 

BARCELONA
--------------

I spent the first 3 days in Barcelona. To reach it, I took a high speed train from Madrid, which lasted about 2hours and was fairly affordable. 

Once arrived there, I brought my stuff to the Airbnb I booked and went on to visit the city. Like everybody (I guess?), I visited the legacy of Antonio Gaudi, with the Güel Park (cheap entrance).
I then went to visit the gothic neighborhood. I really really liked it, but be sure to visit it during the day, as it's apparently not that safe when the sun goes down. 

On the first day, in the evening, I was meeting a girl-friend who was my colleague in my first job. She was there on holidays with her boyfriend who seems like a very nice guy. I had a crush a few years ago on that girl and was genuinly thinking it was from the past, but apparently alcohol decided otherwise. I apparently said stupid things, and she does not talk to me anymore. I'll pass you the details, but you can imagine that my trip was not off to a good start. 

The next day, I visited the Casa Balto (20€ entrance). The Casa Balto entrance fee is definitely not cheap, but it's worth it. This house is simply amazing. I originally did not want to pay that much but the friend saw the day before had convinced me to go and I'm glad I did. I recommend to also check the other Gaudi houses, even if only from outside, as they are quite grandiose. 

Unfortunately, I could not see the inside of the Sagrada Familia. The tickets need to be booked well in advance or you need to go early enough to have day-tickets (limited amount). 

The Barcelonetta beach is also quite nice, lots of little bars where you can take a drink or food and contemplate the sea. I was lucky enough that in the end of september there was not many tourists left, but the weather was still more than good. 

I also visited the Ciutadella park and a few markets.

Then on the last day,  I just walked around the city, feeling like I'd do whatever I liked and my feet took me to the Picasso Museum. Also really worth it, as you can discover the evolution of the life of the artist. It might actually surprise you. 

I then went on to Barcelona Airport to pick up a rental car to continue on my journey. 

Overall, I did not enjoy Barcelona that much. It sure is a beautifull city, as long as you stay in the touristic neighbourhood. As I said, I particularly like the Gothic quarter. But I feel like as soon as you step out of those areas, all the magic goes away. The appartement blocks are ugly and there's no charm whatsoever. It's just like any major city. Rush and disrespect. 

Here's the comparison I'll make with Madrid : Madrid, even though it has no beach (I have to concede, Barcelona is very cool for that point), feels much nicer. People feel nicer, and the Architecture is more developped (?!). I don't know if it's the good way to say it. But even far from the center, I still liked some of the traditional charm that spanish appartment blocks have. Even recently build blocks felt that way, where in Barca it just... didn't. 

Also, it's Catalunya and they are proud of it. They don't really like tourists nor Airbnb. They are not faking it and show it clearly with signs almost at every balcony. 


GIRONA
-------

After taking my rental car, I drove to Girona. For Games of Thrones fans, that's an interesting city. It was used to film some parts of Kings Landing and Braavos. 
It actually really feels like a medieval city. The Cathedral is purely grandiose, the Arab Bath are very interesting, the old Castle is beautifull and gives you a nice overview of the city. I loved those little streets, with paved floor where you can just walk with you eyes up and try to catch every detail you can from all the different houses and atmospheres you can feel there. 

I really recommend to go to Girona if you have time. I spent half a day there and enjoyed it a lot. Just take time to drink a Spritz (or whatever suits you) at the bottom of the steps of the cathedral, watch the other tourists just look at this impressive building. Wander in the little streets, cross the bridges and look at all those little houses that are short to fall into the water. 

Just be prepared, that's even more Catalunya than in Barcelona for the nationalism. But it sort of has its charm.

At the end of my half-day in Girona, I took the car and headed to the Begur Area. I dropped my stuff at the hotel I booked. The Hostel Sa Barraca. This was a relatively cheap hotel but with very good value for money (60€/night I think). I especially recommend it for the hosts. It's an old couple, there super adorable. They speak a basic english and french. The breakfast was really nice, and the room very confortable (I had what I think was satin bedsheets, imagine my surprise!). Also, the sunrise there is absolutely stunning. You have a wonderful view on the sea from your room if you are lucky. If you have to pay a bit of extra to have it, just do it. There that holiday feeling when you wake up with the sunrising on the water, you know it's gonna be a good day. It wars your heart. I could just stay there, eating my breakfast and contemplate the scene that was offered to me. 

I stayed for the next 3 days in that Area. The village of Begur is nice. You can access the ruins of the castle  (different from the Castle itself) on foot via the nice little streets in the center of the village. There's quite a bit of history there, with houses inspired from Cuban architecture. 

The next day, I visited some of the most beautifull villages I've ever seen (except maybe this year in Northern Italy, but in a different style). 

If you like old and well preserved little medieval villages, I highly recommend Pals, Peratallada and Pubol. Peratallada was definitively my favorite. There was almost nobody there, but my god it's beautifull. So much peace, colorfull plants on every wall. I could just stay there for a while, thinking about nothing, just staying lost in time, as this village obviously is. 

You don't have to spend much time in those villages, as they are relatively small and close together. It took me half a day to do all three (starting from Begur at 8 am). 

During the afternoon, I drove to the cute little village of Sa Tuna. This is a gem that not many tourist know about. If you like tiny beaches, with crystal clear water, cute little white houses on the sea side and almost no tourist : go there! (also, the Spritz there is cheap...). I took a bit of time to chill on the beach, relax, read my book and I had a swim. After 4 months of very hard work, that's the first swim I had in the sea that summer. Such a wonderfull feeling. THAT, is holidays. Water was quite chilly so I did not stay long.

So, after that wonderfull swim, I took the road again and drove off to Llafranc and Callela Palafrugel (on the beach, not the town itself). Those are two other charming little villages, also with those typical white houses. I again let my feet take me wherever they wanted to. Those are sush beautifull little places ! If only my boss wouldn't have called me while I was peacefully reading my book on the beach to ask me to go somewhere I did not want to go on my return from holidays. I should have just shut my phone. That ruined my moment. But I consolated myselft with nice food after that, which was nice. Tapas, never enough tapas !

The last day was for Figueres and Cadaques. 
Those were on many lists of places to see. Well, Except for the Dali museum which is well worth it, don't spend more time in Figueres. It's nothing special and even food was not that great. 

I went on to Cadaques, which in contrary to Figueres, is absolutely worth it! It's a bit like the other sea side villages with white houses, but slightly bigger. Slightly more narrow streets, more nature. I really enjoyed it. Just stop for an instant, take an ice cream, sit on the edge of the wall above the water, and relax. Look at the sea and do a bit of tourist watching, which can sometimes be fun. 

There also a tiny Dali museum there, but it's not really worth it. I encourage you to just walk at random in the streets and enjoy the vibe. 

In the evening, I took the car back to my hotel, to have a good night of sleep as I had to wake up quite early for quite a special day. 

HOT AIR BALLOON TRIP
--------------------------

I woke up very early as I had to be at 6.30 at the Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica de la Garrotxa. Why so early? I'm glad you asked! 

Today is the day I was taking a hot air balloon trip over this former volcanic region. They ask you to arrive this early, simply to enjoy climbing in altitude with the sun rising. That was, in my humble opinion, one if not the most epic scene I've ever witnessed. This is absolutely stunning. Imagine one moment. You are in complete darkness. In almost complete silence (except the burner from the hot air balloon breaking it from time to time, but it also warms you up so it's actually appreciated! Also, 3m tall flames are kinda cool.), you are rising above the floor. As you climb up above ground,  far far away, you notice the first slim lights of the day, but they don't reach you yet. 

As you continue climbing up, and the light from the sun is slowly growing, you notice a slight white-ish pellicule of fog sticking to the ground. Only the little hills from the volcanic past of the region are pointing their nose through those tiny clouds. The lights are amplificating. It bounces on the hills and the fog, with a nice and warming orange halo. You are still in silence. Everyone of the 10 people on board is totaly silent and contemplates the beauty of Mother Nature in front of us. Trust me, I have tears coming up my eyes while rememoring this. 

Then, when the sun is up, the pilot of the hot air balloon starts unpacking the ""breakfast"". A glass of champagne and catalan cake. I usually say no to alcohol before noon, but I figured ""oh well, if not now in the magical theatre, when?"". 

Then, he gives you explanations of what's happening, where you are, how to drive that big balloon, and how to land it. He also tells you that depending on the wind, you may or may not go very far. 

It lasted a total of 1h30-ish, of pure contemplation and pure magic. After you land, two 4X4 are coming to pick you up, and the staff kindly asks you to give them a hand to fold the housing of the balloon that has now deflated and lies on the ground like a dead monster. 

Once you do that, they bring you back to the center where you took of from, they round you around a table with everyone that was on board with you and they serve you a true feast! Gosh, I thougt I was gonna explode after so much delicious catalan food! 

After a good hour of eating and listening to stories of the guides, it was time to go and visit the last villages before heading to the airport and go home the next day. Just FYI, I think the hot air balloon trip + the food was a package and costed about 230€ all included. Seems expensive, but well worth it. Once again, the area and the scene were just epic !!! 


LAST HALF DAY
-----------------

During my last afternoon, I visited a few places &amp; villages that were left on my list. I first started by going into a forest not that far from where I did the hot air balloon trip. This area is full of gorges but I unfortunately did not have enough time to do them all. So, I did go to the Gorg del Molí dels Murris. It's a bit less impressive than on many pictures of the internet, especially because there was less water at that time. But I was there for a good 45 minutes, I just sat on the floor and I let any thoughts flow and go, trying not to focus on anything particular. Maybe it was meditation, I don't know, never done that. This felt good and that's all that matters. 

Next, I went to Castlefollit de la roca. Internet pictures are showing a tiny and cute village on the edge of a cliff. Sure, from afar, it's impressing. The village itselft, not so much. I just found it quite ugly, not that interesting and dirty. I think I spent 20 minutes there, then left. I stopped with my car on the way to Besalu as I had the view on Castelfollit on its cliff, which was more interesting. 

Last village I did was Besalu. Really recommend it. You can't miss the old-stone bridge, and the narrow medieval streets of that village. It's worth it to go there if you have time. But don't plan too much as an hour or two are more than enough. Also, don't eat there. I could not find a single restaurant that looked like it was really worth it. 

Which brings me to the very last place I visited during my stay : Olot. If you look on a map, it's true, it's close to where I took the hot air balloon trip, but I my hotel was also there, so it makes sense. I walked around the city for a bit. It's a nice little town and I saw it from above during the hot air balloon trip and it had a nicely shaped form for a city. There's nothing that exceptional about it.  then headed to a tapas restaurant. Then I headed for the last hostel room, which was a nightmare (did not check before, but it was above a bar). Luckily, my night was meant to be short as I had to drive to the airport to be there at 8 in the morning. 

This conclude my report on the trip itself.


MENTAL STATE
----------------

As I mentionned in the beginning of this report, this trip took place directly after very intensive 4 months of work in Madrid. I was truly exhausted both physically and mentally and definitely needed a break. I was slightly afraid of going alone on holidays as it was my first time doing so. I often travel alone for work, but this was different. I did not know what to expect. 

If you've read everything, you'll know by now that my first day of the trip did no go that well, with me loosing a friend (Linea, if you read this... I'm sorry again). Luckily for me (or not), I've had enough drawbacks in my life to be able to go over this quickly enough for the duration of my stay. I'll worry about this when I'll be home. 
The rest of the trip went fine. I sometimes did not really know what to do, I had change of mind regarding what I wanted to see or visit, where to eat. Would the restaurant accept only one person ?(they usually did). 

I discovered that I enjoyed beeing alone with myself, even if sometimes I was missing one or two of my friends in particular. 
I could indeed just do whatever I wanted, just let my feet take me where they wanted. Not get out of bed in the morning if I did not want to. 

This was a good occasion also to reflect on myselft. I haven't discovered anything I did not know, but I kinda understood more of what I already knew. 

I just regret not turning my phone off and checking my professional emails during my stay. I should learn to leave work aside to truly enjoy the break.

CONCLUSION
---------------

I liked my first solo trip. I understood a bit more about me. I prefer Madrid to Barcelona. I loved the Begur Area and the  Garrotxa park. 

I liked it so much that I did it again this year, in Northern Italy. You can probably find my report from mid-september under ""7 days in northern Italy"" somewhere in the posts below. 

Enjoy the reading, and if you have questions, feel free to ask. 

Cheers!

I have never traveled solo before! I am planning my first solo road trip. How is my plan so far?,"what’s up everybody! 

i’m 23 years old, and i haven’t been out of town in over a year and i have been saving all my 1’s and coins for a year now and i have a pretty good amount of cash saved up. i want to take a lone road trip next month, and i have never went on a long trip alone before. i live in central illinois, and i want to go to yosemite! i also want to stop by pikes peak on the way. 
i’m starting all this planning by creating my route and breaking it up into 8-10 hour stretches of driving. from where i live, my maps app tells me it will take 27 hours to drive to yosemite. i will only be able to have 8 days to make this trip happen. 
i have sundays and monday’s off from work, and i’m going to take 1 week off for this trip. i’m planning on leaving work on a saturday to shower and put my things in my car and leave around 1am just to get a start, and i will probably find a rest stop 2-3 hours out to get a nap in my car since i will be pretty tired after working 13 hours that day. that way i can just get the first few hours out of the way and get a head start.

day 1:
my first stop would be in denver, which is about 14 hours from where i live. i’m thinking i’m going to get a hotel there to rest up and i’m going to leave in the morning to pikes peak. 

day2:
it will be around 2 hours to get to the summit of pikes peak from denver, in which i’ll spend maybe 2-3 hours at. then i plan on making my way towards fresno from pikes peak.
i’m not sure which places to stop at to get sleep on the way to fresno, but i’m guessing i could make it about 11 hours and get a hotel room in saint george, utah. 

day 3:
wake up in saint george, and head towards fresno. this stretch would be about 7.5-8 hours. i will be going through las vegas on the way. i don’t have time to visit there, but i do want to get a picture at the famous welcome sign. 
when i get to fresno, i’m going to find a hotel and settle in. i’ll have a few hours to kill so i might just find a cool spot to eat, or grab a drink somewhere.

day 4:
this is the day i get to see what i ventured for! i’m going up to yosemite to spend the day. after this i am unsure if i should stay in fresno one more night to spend more time at yosemite, or start making my way back home afterwards. 

who has been to yosemite before? should i spend two days there?

a) i leave yosemite towards salt lake city, and stay somewhere in nevada over night on the way there. perhaps hawthorne, nevada which is 6.5-7 hours from yosemite. 
b) i drive back to fresno to stay another night.

day 5a:
i leave hawthorne, nevada in the morning to drive about 7.5-8 hours to salt lake city. coming from this way, i’ll get to drive through the salt flats. i’ve always wanted to see the salt flats in person. i’ll hang out in salt lake city for the night and rest there. 
day5b:
go to yosemite again the second day in a row, spend some hours there again, and then leave towards hawthorne, nevada to rest for the night.

day6a: 
check out salt lake city for the morning, find a nice spot to get some lunch, and then get on the road and drive 9.5 hours to north platte, nebraska to rest. 
day6b: 
drive to salt lake city to hang for the night.

day7a:
get on the road again to drive the last 9 or so hours home in illinois. i’ll get to look through all my pictures and unpack and get some rest before going back to work the next day. although, i only work 4 hours the first work day after this trip. 
day7b: head from salt lake to north platte, nebraska.

day 8b:
head from nebraska to home in illinois to get to bed and wrap up my vacation. 


how does this plan sound? does anyone know of any better ways to split up each stretch of driving? does anyone have any tips for someone traveling solo for on a long road trip like this for the first time? is there anything i should know about pikes peak or yosemite or salt lake city prior to visiting? 

thanks guys!!!

edit:
thanks for the input guys! creating a plan for this trip is so much fun, and i am really looking forward to this trip. 

i have decided that i am going post pone my trip until february/march. this will give me more time to plan and prepare. also, november might not be the best time to try and go up pikes peak, or drive through the high sierras lol. 

i am moving to chicago in march with two close friends, so i am going to plan to make this trip then. when i leave my current job, i am going to take two weeks to go on this trip before i start my new job in chicago. this way, i won’t have to feel any guilt from my current employers for taking two weeks off for myself. i know that i can get a week off, but i think asking for two would be pushing it. if i start a new job, i don’t think it would be right to take two weeks off for a long time, so i think it’s best to take this trip in between jobs. 
until then, i think i am going to just ask for two days off next month to make a 4 day weekend, and take a little solo trip up to the upper peninsula in northern wisconsin. my dad told me that it’s about a 6-7 hour drive, it’s touristy and scenic, and there was a lot of people my age around when he was there. at first that idea didn’t sound anywhere near as exciting as going to yosemite, because i’ve lived in illinois most my life and i was never too thrilled when i have visited wisconsin before. but i’ve never really been to the parks up there, so after thinking about it i think that does sound like a good idea. 

i think it will give me a taste of the solo travel and might prepare me more for my longer road trip i’m planning in the spring. it also won’t be expensive either. i want to check out the scenic spots at devils lake, and i want to hike around the apostle islands. 
not only that, but i’ll be able to get a case of that famous new glarus spotted cow to bring home! i don’t get to drink a spotted cow very often, but it can only be bought in wisconsin. where i live, everybody loves that stuff because it’s a treat you can’t have very often. whenever friends go up to wisconsin to visit, they always take orders for their friends and family and bring back spotted cows for everyone back home. if you’re unfamiliar, spotted cow is just a farmhouse style ale. we love it here in central illinois.
again, thanks for the replies! i’m very excited to plan this mini wisconsin trip and take my first official solo trip. 

have any of you traveled wisconsin? have any of you been to devils lake or the apostle islands? if so, how was it? are there any other places worth seeing in wisconsin?",solotravel,HoldenDarko

In the middle of October i'll be traveling to the great falls area for work. I'll have the weekend to myself and I do have some vacation days I am entertaining the idea of using after the weekend.   


My idea was to fly into Great Falls then fly out of Bozeman, MT. Is this a good idea? or are there NEED to see places, like Yellowstone? 

Whats the Covid situation like?

Met a suitable one while traveling,"During September 2019, I decided to bagpack across Europe as a graduation treat. It was a 2 month trip with no prior planning. While my time in Germany, someone in my hostel suggested me to try out paragliding in interlaken. I googled it and found it quite amusing. So while I was traveling from Frankfurt to Bern, I saw a girl in my train. I started a small talk with her and soon we both found each other truly interesting and started having longer conversations about ourselves. When we reached Bern, I told her that didn't make any hostel bookings and would be leaving for Interlaken 2 days after. She asked me if I wanna make a booking in the hostel she was staying in to which I agreed. We connected to greater extent through the conversations we were having. While traveling the old city, the only thing in my mind was to make a move and kiss her. I think she was thinking the same. We spent the whole night across a lonely sight across the Aare river. We talked about life and had some deep talks. I made a move and we had sex in the open. 

After 2 days, she agreed to travel with me to interlaken. After spending a fun day in interlaken, we came back to bern, from where she had to leave for france. We were extremely sad to leave each other that day and had a perfect make out at the train station. We exchanged our snapchats and said goodbyes 👋. 

Since then we have been connected through social media and have came even closer to each other. No I think she's is the one I always have been looking for. I'm thinking to propose her soon.",solotravel,[deleted]
"(Oregon, U.S.) Looking to do some solo traveling around Oregon. I have about a week to explore and would love to soak in the fall colors and crisp air while I can.

I’ve camped in Tillamook, cape disappointment, and Detroit lake and those were amazing as well. 

I’m thinking of checking out national parks if I can such as Crater lake, Olympic (in Washington) and maybe mt Rainier. 

I was going to hike the timberline trail with some friends but with the fires and wind as of now there’s a section that’s partially damaged and pretty difficult. My friends don’t want to do it so we’re camping elsewhere in the meantime, but I’d love to get some good hikes in soon while I can. 

Whether it’s camping or hiking or just exploring a secret gem of a state park, (or even something else entirely!) I just want to explore this beautiful state while I’m here during the prime fall time. 
Any recommendations are highly appreciated. Thanks to anyone who has some suggestions! 
Much love and your state is beautiful. But you PNW folk already know that.

isla holbox one of the last,"I had been eyeing Isla Holbox ever sense I did a roadtrip in the area, and it was exactly what I hoped for. A gritty but refined get lost kind  of an escape option in Covid times. And not for everyone which is what keeps it what it is. I  had thoughts of ""The Mosquito Coast"", an old Harrison Ford film on this  trip. As with any place you can find like this, it wont be long before  it changes. As for now, humbly enjoy an unforgettable experience.

First  things first: travel light, grab bug spray and exchange for some pesos.  Then wrap your head around getting to the island from the airport. You  could hire a quick prop plane ride, drive or shuttle. For most, a  shuttle does the trick and provides you with a perspective of the  undeveloped area outside of Cancun. A scheduled time shuttle is a very  reasonable price or you can pay double for a private ride. My suggestion  is to use the private ride to get there because the fair includes  shuttle, boat ride and cart taxi to your hotel. Now that you've had the  guided walk through you'll see how simple it is to return on your own  with a scheduled shuttle. This is a 2hr drive so if arriving into Cancun  later just stay at one of the close hotel options. Next morning you can  have your private ride arranged from the hotel or shuttle back to the  airport for a scheduled shuttle time.

[isla holbox](https://preview.redd.it/fknbr5ba3pr51.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc3529ca08d119836d3ab49df51a0da59a9635f8)

If driving through  undeveloped countryside, then taking a boat ride to arrive on a  primitively refined island sounds like your taste, you've just nailed  it. So now where to stay. After back-and-forth debating I decided on  Tierra del Mar. Bingo. What you have here is the perfect scenario for a  visit to the island: value, location and a peaceful size. Its a highly  maintained minimalist hotel (more of a bnb) with only 6 rooms with  patios, a small zen courtyard, pool and breakfast area. And just outside  the courtyard doors you have immediate access to the vibrant pleasure  of the primitive town and all its character. Not to mention the beach of  course is just an ally away. This as opposed to an upscale stay on the  beach made more sense to fully absorb the personality of the island. And  that's really how it felt.

Regardless of what you decide  everything is walking distance or a quick cart taxi away. After the trek  to get here, then quickly checking in and dropping your bags, all you  want to do is walk along the amazing waterfront. White sand, pond-calm  mint green water and knee deep for a couple hundred feet. Its so eye  catching that cloudy days are even more beautiful then blue sky because  the grays, blue and mint green is another worldly sight. Sooner or later  you'll decide to sit down with your feet up and grab some seafood for  lunch at Raices. I had the best sweet-spicy octopus ceviche salad  concoction I've ever eaten. And washed it down with a marg on the rocks.  Then carried on north to the end to get my bearings for several spots  for diner and drinks later on in the trip.

After that I was ready  to return to the quiet sanctuary of the hotel. Pool time with a  refreshment until dinner. There's a market just steps away for the  essentials. That evening I began with my first dinner at Zapata. A hand  crafted cave just right off the street with no flooring. The perfect  ambiance and grilled fish dinner to start and end the first day. Night  cap back at the pool and called it a day. The next morning I awoke to  the quiet and newly manicured zen of the small courtyard from my patio.  An assortment of breakfast options, and most importantly coffee, is  awaiting every morning at 8am. Perfecto. I took my time that morning  before heading, now south, along the coastline to the end. Honestly one  of the most unforgettable beach walks you'll ever have. The perfect  blend of natural beach beauty combined with sections of dilapidated  colorful structures. And again best seen cloudy for contrast.

Its  about 2-3hrs of walking once you get back to the hotel so pool time  once again before dinner. Refreshment in hand again--of course. After a  great couple hours relaxing at the pool it was time to get ready for  din. A much anticipated steak night at the rooftop of Parrilla de Juan. A  nice little walk through the town square to a colorfully tiled  staircase leading above to steak heaven. One of the best flavor of meat,  no sauce, I've had. And perfectly paired to savor with an Old Fashion  to wash down. Take your time here. Enjoy every bite and the open rooftop  evening. And with that back to a night cap at the pool and called it a  night. Boat day in the morning.

Another perfectly manicured  courtyard step over to breakfast and coffee. The quiet minimalist  mornings here are calming and very enjoyed. Especially being the last  morning to enjoy. The cart taxi would be arriving soon for my boat  excursion for the day. I could have simply walked to the beachfront and  hired the excursion myself but the prices are so reasonable even booking  through the hotel is shocking. (Speaking of price, it really should be  noted how great of a value this island visit it. It's very very  reasonable. To get the best pricing for smaller business make sure to  have pesos. For the fancier drinks and dinner spots at hotels a CC is  fine.) For the excursion I went with the multi island tour. Nothing  really note worthy except the sandbar stop, which is worth it alone.  Other than that its just a great day out on the mint green waters.

Before  relaxing back at the pool for my last day I wanted to grab some tacos  street side. So I popped over to Barba Negra for an assortment of taco  offers. Its everything you'd be looking for: good vibes, great drinks  and mouthwatering tacos. From there I was set for my last time by the  pool and the big decision. The last night dinner choice along with a  comfortable shirt and my slip ons.  There's a couple choices best for this that end on a fancier note. And  to be upfront, honest and fair I didn't make the right choice. I wanted  to end with sushi to enjoy the fresh option that seems no-brainer. I  went with, what was highly recommended, Tamashi Sky Bar. Unfortunately,  being the Covid situation the dinner area was really just a pool area,  its back off the beach and the sushi was just ok. My suggestion is to  end with dinner on the water at Casa Las Tortugas or Las Nubes. Both are  the finer hotel options on the island and offer a very scenic dinner  experience on the water.

But hey, no complaints the evening was  still very enjoyed and ended with a last night cap back at the pool. The  next morning I awoke early and enjoyed the short walk back to the ferry  terminal. A last gritty and quiet pleasure that will be remembered  forever. The few early streetside vendors preparing coffee and juices  and tortilla shops long at work already. Then on to your last ferry  ride, on the top open deck, to ponder what you've just experienced. The  perfect blend of primitive and refined option with the energy of one of  your favorite tropical adventure films. The 7:15am shuttle will be  awaiting for your ride back to the airport. Enjoy.

Pro Tip: Have  pesos on you for your beach walks, there's several stops to grab a  refreshment. Hagel at the beach with the vendors for your boat day,  especially with a group. Do grab a dinner night at Luuma. And consider  trying different hotels, especially for the last evening along with  dinner.",solotravel,_buoyed_

Costings ! 6 month sabbatical.,"Hey.

I am looking to take 6 months off work to travel as soon as covid is over, i have worked without a break of more than 2 weeks since age 14 !( (just turned 31) so I am super itching to do this (was planned for this year but yeah)

I have a fairly good idea of what the cost of doing this is, but would like other peoples opinions and experiences so i can budget better. I am planning on going to Russia, Isreal, China/Korea and also Southern USA and possibly back to Europe. (I live in UK).

So what do you guys think ? I suspect I am looking at around 10k.

My solo trip to Berlin during a pandemic,"I just got back from a weekend trip to Berlin from Venice. I'm a 23 years old girl.

While the airport was almost empty and i encountered no queues, my ryanair flight was packed, but everyone was wearing masks and using hand sanitizers. 

I arrived to Shonefeld on friday and took the covid test immediatly. It wasn't mandatory but i took it anyway. I'd rather be safe than sorry. There was only a five minute queue to get it. I got my results through the app, the same evening.

Got to my hotel by using the S-bahn which was almost empty.

I than took a walk around the city. By german law you are not required to keep your masks outside, but i wore mine all the time, even when i was alone. I noticed that germans do not like to wear masks, wheather it was outside, and someone even didn't wore it inside places.

The only ones who where wearing masks where tourists from other countries.

The next day i took a free walking tour. We wore masks and keep 1.5 meters apart between each other, and we were a small group anyway. All the attractions visited were outside.

On sunday i took a tour to Sachsenhausen, a concentration camp. This one was really sad but really interesting. All partecipants respected the social distancing rules.

I didn't eat at restaurants, i only eat take away in my room to be safe and wore gloves when taking my food. 

Before leaving monday i took another covid test at the airport.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we should travel, to an extent. the guides i spoke to where almost moved to tears that somebody showed up for the tour, because us travelling is the only reason they have a job and can provide food for their families. 

If you travel, be careful, wear a mask, take covid tests if you can. And of course check the rules of your country and the country you want to travel to. Safety is always the priority.

Are there any places in America that I should avoid/stray towards as a black British traveller?,"I've been wanting to travel to the US for a long time, and I've heard that there are many places that are less safe than others, on account of gang activity and racism among police/citizens.

I am mixed Caribbean/Welsh, with facial piercings and pec-length dreadlocks, in case that makes any difference.

I'm also a short guy, at 5'6"", in case that also makes any difference (in terms of maybe being more or less imposing to the general public and police officers)

Thanks, I hope to be able to select a perfect US destination soon &lt;3


Edit: For context, I come from Cardiff, which, as a former Port City, is one of the most diverse cities in the UK.  The city can, however, be dangerous, and knowing what's what and who's who goes a long way over here.  Racism, however, isn’t that big of a deal here, at least in my experience, and what racist experiences I have had here are mostly just kids being retarded, or people with genuinely decent intentions coming out with kinda dodgy questions/statements.

Edit 2: For the most part, I'm not really worried about racism among the public, and am more worried about areas in which being black could get me shot, for example (going off of what I've heard/read of course) That's not to say that i want to visit a fully bigoted, Southern stereotype kind of area, but as a person, as long as it's only an annoyance and not a danger, racism doesn't really bother me all that much, provided I am safe.",solotravel,chickentoast26

"Covid cancelled my trip, looking for advice and recommendations","So I planned my very first international trip for November 3-25, and it happened to be to a bunch of countries I can no longer get into. I have this time off from work and I don't really want to waste it so I'm looking for advice for last minute travel to somewhere letting Americans in. IDK if I should look for some kind of guided trips, like from Intrepid travel, or just make something up on my own at this point. Also Intrepid and Quark are the only companies I know about, can anyone recommend others to look at? What places should I look into going? 

I don't want to have to quarantine after arrival because that would waste most of my trip. I already got Covid in April so I'm not worried about getting it myself, but I also don't know if activities will be shut down or not. I'm out of shape and not looking to do any kind of intense physically active travelling, something more like a casual city I can explore at my own pace. Thanks for any advice.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your advice. I'd also like to say I got covid from working as a nurse in a covid unit, so I am well versed in the subject. When I say I don't worry about it, it doesn't mean that I plan on not following any precautions, because I do and will continue to do so.",solotravel,DietRainbows
"Trip to Munich, Berlin, Prague, and Krakow - Advice needed","Hi, in mid-late October I'm thinking of doing a 14 day trip to Munich, Berlin, Prague, and maybe Krakow if I can squeeze it in. I'm currently from Canada which, for now, is allowed unrestricted entry into these countries. This is my first trip to Europe so I might have to move slower due to my inexperience.

I know a more common first Central/Eastern Europe trip is Prague, Budapest, Vienna, but both Vienna and Budapest aren't allowing visitors from Canada

Going into Prague first would mean I can't go into Germany due to Covid restrictions, so I think I'll have to start with Germany.

I'd appreciate some advice on whether this rough schedule would work given my interests.

**Interests**:

\- Beautiful sights like Neuschwanstein Castle, the Alps, Prague Castle, Salt Mines- Museums- History- Trying new food

I've roughly allocated 3 days to each place since the 10h flight from Canada to Berlin will happen on Day 1 and the return flight from Krakow to Canada.

**Day 1-4: Berlin**

\- 10h flight to Berlin

\- Take the Deutsche Bahn to Munich on last day (\~5 hours)

**Day 5-8 Munich**

\- Day trip to the Bavarian Alps

\- \~5 hour train ride to Prague

**Day 8-11 Prague**

\- Either 9 hour train ride or 1 hour flight to Krakow

**Day 11-14 Krakow**

\- If time permits, would like to check out the Aushwitz Memorial

\- Fly back to Canada on last day (10h+ flight)

My best friend tainted the last European trip we took. Would I be wrong to tell her I want to travel alone from now on?,"About two years ago I traveled to Europe for a week with my best friend and could not believe how horrible she acted. We stopped at a fast food restaurant on the way to the airport and she made a comment about how the worker should be in college and not working there. At the airport, we ran into someone we went to high school with and she laughed at him for working there and having to watch us take a trip to Spain. When we got there, she was extremely controlling, talked down to me and others regularly, barely wanted to go anywhere or do anything while on the trip, and had a micromanaging attitude 80% of the time. While I still managed to have a great trip and found a new obsession with traveling, I didn’t have fun with her. I had fun in spite of her. 

When we got back home we didn’t speak for months. She later apologized to me and said that she realized whenever she feels insecure or bad about herself she treats others badly to feel better about herself. I’ve forgiven her and I still consider her my best friend, but I later found out she told the rest of our friend group that while she can be very “motherly”, I was the one who was “stubborn” and didn’t want to do or try anything new. THIS coming from someone who didn’t want to go to any main attractions, sites or events and wanted to go to the same cafe every day. To me, that was her way of not taking full responsibility for her actions. I decided after that I will never travel with her again and travel solo going forward. Recently, our friends group started planning a trip for when covid dies down. I’ve made it clear that I won’t be going and while I haven’t said it outright, they all know it’s because she’s going too. They said I should move past it and give her a second chance but I refuse because I know how bad she acted. I truly love her and we are still best friends, but I’ve decided not to let her taint another trip for me. Am I wrong for that?",solotravel,YoYoheel73

How far does 18k USD get me in 2021-2022?,"I plan on traveling from May 2021 to August 2022.  By that time I will have saved $18k.  

Given the way this pandemic is going (assuming borders open, it is safe, or there's a vaccine, etc.), I plan to travel in the U.S. and Canada to mostly national parks or outdoor recreational areas from May-October.  I have recently converted a minivan into a camper, so that would get me ~20 mpg and a place to stay each night.  If the pandemic lifts a bit, then I will probably explore some cities for no more than a couple days at a time too.

Based on how this pandemic is going, I would probably head to SE Asia in October 2021 and jump around until around February 2022.  I know this is vague....but I honestly wouldn't plan much more other than a one-way ticket.

February 2022 I will hopefully ski out west in the U.S. for 3-4 weeks or so (ski passes ~$800).

By the time March 2022 comes, *hopefully* Latin America is cleared up from the pandemic and I can travel starting from Mexico City and make may way to Colombia.  Latin America is one of my favorite regions, so if the pandemic clears up quicker than expected there, then I would probably skip SE Asia and double my time there!

I know this is extremely vague and very variable, but I'm just trying to day dream about life after uni and push off studying for my exam that I have coming up later.  Does this sound feasible on $18k if I live frugally?  I also plan to get an airlines credit card that should get me a couple round-trip tickets from the sign-up bonus.",solotravel,you_dub_englishman
Traveling solo again at 69 and every day has been a joy,"I backpacked in Europe a few times as a young man, taking overnight trains to save on lodging, occasionally rolling out my mat on the floor of the train because there were no empty seats.  I traveled without any advance reservations for lodging, and no firm itinerary.  Upon arriving in each new city, I would stash my stuff in a locker or bag check window at the train station, and search for a pension or hostel on foot, then return later to retrieve my pack.  It was easy to meet other travelers my age and join up for a few days when we were going to the same cities.  I moved every few days, visited a lot of places, and had wonderful experiences.

As a new retiree and single, I yearned to travel abroad again but worried if I could manage it solo, feared it would be difficult to meet people, had concerns about health care abroad, and didn’t think I would fit in at hostels.  This time around I wanted to stay in each place for a week or more and explore deeper, at a more relaxed pace.  I also wanted more privacy and comfort than my hostel provided 40 years ago, and expenses were less of an issue (my first trip to Europe was on a student loan; the government &amp; banks didn’t  send the money directly to the college back then and I knew I would not get enough time off for a long trip once I started my career.  I had no money so I borrowed 2k and spent it all on a 5-week trip, knowing I could repay the loan once I graduated and got a job).

For my first “test trip” post-retirement, I decided on a  month long visit to Argentina and Uruguay.  Before leaving the US, I booked a studio apt for a week in Buenos Aires and an inexpensive hotel for a week in Montevideo, but left myself an open itinerary for the last 2+ weeks.  I heard good things from locals about the lake region of Argentina and decided to go, booking a studio apt in Bariloche for a week.  

I had a wonderful time and managed to deal with the curve balls that were thrown at me traveling alone in countries where I didn’t speak the language, such as a mrsa infection in my knee that required two weeks of 2 strong antibiotics.  Treatment at an ER was prompt, professional and free!  

But didn’t meet many people other than the managers of the properties where I stayed.  So when I returned to Buenos Aires for a week before my flight home, I decided to try a hostel again.  I got a single room rather than a dorm (I use a CPAP machine for sleep apnea, which can annoy others, and I need quiet to sleep well).  It was a very small and basic room but I quickly met a couple of young guys newly arrived from Germany, over a beer in the common area.  We hit it off and I felt right at home.  I concluded that both solo travel and hostels were still great at age 69.

Six months later I left for a month-long, solo trip to Berlin, Krakow, and Budapest, staying at hostels and a YMCA.  I had a blast and enjoyed the hostel experience.  They were mostly much nicer than in my youth, and I always chose well-located ones with good access to public transport.  They were often in “hipster” neighborhoods with lots of activity and youthful energy.  I was always able to get a private room at a good price.  My step tracker app reported that I walked an average of 13 miles per day, far more than was my custom at home.  Every day was a joy.    

Afterward, I reflected on what enabled me to feel such joy even with the occasional panic-arousing catastrophe, such as getting pickpocketed in Berlin my 2nd day.  I noted two big differences from my life at home.  First, I did not watch TV much at all because even when I had access, I could not understand the language and I preferred to be out exploring and eating.  At home, I was use to watching TV at every meal and in the evening, but the political news often got me riled or depressed, and the commercials often seemed annoying, manipulative and dishonest.  

The most salient difference though, was the fun I had taking pictures everywhere.  This involved exploring with curiosity and focusing on things that were interesting or beautiful while framing out the boring and the ugly, then editing and sharing them with friends back home.  This has become a metaphor for my life today.  I look for the beautiful and the good, and try to avoid focusing on anything else.  It makes me feel joyful.  There are plenty of things wrong with the world, and plenty of great things too.  Whether I focus on the bad stuff or the good stuff, the world  remains the same, but I don’t.  The more I practice looking for beauty and goodness, while avoiding ruminating on things that make me angry, confrontational or sad, the better I feel.  It’s a bit selfish really, but I choose to act in ways that make me feel good.  When I feel joyous, I act better.  People seem to respond positively to this, and if my being kind, humble, generous, and friendly brings others some good feelings too, that’s great, it’s a win-win.  But mostly I do it for me. 😎

Trip to Bulgaria: Sofia and/or Varna,"Hi all,  I have one week vacation (mon to sat) and I am looking for a new place to visit in Europe. Looking at Covid restrictions, one option is **Bulgaria**, Sofia or Varna or both (if possible in 6 days)

On my first full day in Bozeman, I planned on doing a day trip down to Yellowstone via US-191, US-20, and Grand Loop Rd in Yellowstone before heading back to Bozeman. Then the next day doing the Beartooth Highway (stopping at vistas and possibly the summer ski area off that road) on my way to stay in Greybull. Then Rapid City on US-14 with a detour to Devil's Tower, then the next morning back to MPLS.

I want to incorporate Grand Teton NP into this somehow, but I don't want to have to spend another night somewhere. What I considered is going through Yellowstone on US-191 on my first day, hitting Teton as well afterwards, then back to Bozeman. This would let me hit both of them, but I would be spending 8 and a half hours on the road that day. Which isn't a problem in itself, but if I'm going to these amazing places I don't want to be in my car all day. The next day I would go from Bozeman to Greybull on US-212, but take a detour to see the Yellowstone Canyon, And try to go skiing. This is another 8 hour drive.

Does anyone have suggestions on this? Other things to do along this route? Or other places to stay in WY on a budget? I looked at a map and say Greybull was about halfway between Bozeman and Rapid City, so that's why I picked it.

Edit: Thanks to some suggestions, I think I'm going to only do 1 night in Bozeman, and instead stay closer to Yellowstone the next night. It's also becoming apparent that I will need to add an additional day to my trip if I want to hit Teton too.",solotravel,NormanQuacks345
"Been planning a trip for a year, now I can't rent my reserved vehicle with a netspend card! What do I do?","Hi guys.  I am planning a hunting trip during October.  I've already sunk well over $1500 into this trip, taken the time out of work, even had to show a court my car rental itinerary to be rescheduled for jury duty.  I reserved a car back in July.  I just called the rental place today to inquire as to what the deposit/hold is on my card (so I could ensure I have the funds on there) and in the conversation, I was informed that prepaid cards were not acceptable.  I have no other card, the only reason I even have that one is for the rare occasion that I absolutely need to pay for something with a card.

Has anyone been to Antarctica? Worth it or not?,"I am putting away money to save up as I want to visit and see the scenery. My only option would likely be a cruise, but I'm not sure. I imagine the views are fantastic and it is an unforgiving place.

Majestic wildlife, I'd love to see all the animals, and I think it's safe to say the scenery would take one's breath away.

Has anyone been? Was it worth the cost or not? I imagine it's extremely expensive, but that's understandable enough. Once in a lifetime experience and a fragile place that needs protecting.

"Have you travelled solo while working 9-5? If so, how was it and do you have any recommendations?","Hi all, in contrast to other post regarding quitting to travel, I'm curious if people have continued working while travelling. 

Since a lot of jobs have become remote, I do have the option to travel while being able to work remotely but I do have questions and concerns regarding it. 

My hours are roughly 9-5 EST on most days so will likely be working 30+ hours a week while remote. While that obviously limits the time I will have to explore, will it hinder my experience travelling?

I'm planning a RTW trip so the time zones will also vary wildly, and am thinking to spend most time in SA so I be in similar time zone for the most part. Lastly, good work environment is also a must. (High Wifi + Quite area) to work since I will have to hop on calls often.

Is Paris worth it?,"Paris has always been one of my top destinations but recently I've been feeling uncertain about it. I actually usually avoid cities, I really dislike modern buildings and crowds of people but I love old buildings and architecture and art and the whole atmosphere of an old city like Paris. But one of my first doubts was when one of my online friends was raving about how much they wanted to see London for it's old buildings and such, and it hit me that I've been to London a million times and it's terrible (in my opinion). The amount of modern buildings and shops swamp the old stuff and anything worth seeing is surrounded by trashy new stuff. I thought to myself, if I'd never been to London, I'd probably see it as some fantasy version too, and is that the same way I'm seeing Paris in my mind? The only city I can really think of that pretty much meets expectations is Edinburgh, but even then nowadays it's overrun with tacky tourist giftshops.

Another friend of mine who lived in France for several years as a kid said she took a trip to Paris and said it was really dirty and full of litter and overall unpleasant. She didn't make it sound like the romantic, gothic city I have in my head. But she might have been viewing it through a different lense, she doesn't really care for old architecture or anything like that. I know it will be touristy to some degree, of course it will, but I'm not sure the extent or how much of Paris is actually lovely old buildings and streets and how much is office buildings and tescos. Was anyone dissapointed by Paris? 

I'm hopefully going to be travelling Europe solo next year and want to spend a lot of time seeing old castles, and I don't know if Paris is something I should just skip and leave as a nice fantasy in my head because now I'm really worried it will dissapoint me.",solotravel,Final-Dig-7080
"As a traveler, which phone number app do you recommend?","*Besides Google Voice and Skype.

"To those who have quit their jobs to travel for a long time, How did it affect your career?","I'm 27 now and I've been dreaming of spending a year going through Central and South America. I really feel like I'm wasting my 20's working. ""Youth is wasted on the young"" right? 

The thing is, I already did the ""gap year"" thing after I graduated. One year teaching English and another 6 months travelling. My career is already roughly two years behind and pretty inexperienced. So I feel as if I'm being greedy. My job right now is kind of mediocre, I don't enjoy it and am actively looking to move for a raise/better title. 

I've got plenty of money to do a trip, but not enough for a deposit on a house. Property is expensive in my city (and only going up) but still achievable. My friends are buying houses now and I could as well in a couple of years if I don't travel. Right now I just invest my excess money. If I sell my car and use the liquid cash I always have, that should be enough for the whole year and I won't need to touch any of my stocks. 

I work in the tech industry. In my country (Australia), It's doesn't pay as well as the USA, but it's still decent and the demand for jobs is high-ish. I just want to know if there are other people who were roughly in my situation. I also understand this will be a heavily biased sub. 

Right now my plan is to get my career into a better position, one more job potentially two. Then at 29 (18 months away), I just need to go and do it while I've still got some of my 20's left.

My #1 travel advice: Wake up early,"I really don't like being in crowds, and I'm guessing most of you don't either.  The easiest way to avoid crowds is just to wake up early.  

You can have a very leisurely morning breakfast, go for a nice long walk alone in a very picturesque neighborhood or park, go see some usually-crowded sights, and then have an early lunch when restaurants aren't busy and the food is freshest. I'm also self-conscious when eating alone in most busy restaurants, but I don't care at all when there's hardly anyone else eating.  

I just saw a post in r/travel where someone said it's impossible to avoid pictures with ridiculous crowds at the Great Wall of China.  Well, I just woke up early, and walked nearly the entire public section of Mutianyu very leisurely before anyone else showed up except a couple vendors setting up for the day.  https://imgur.com/gallery/mTiiYYg

Then I often take a break in the early afternoon when everyone else is crowding transit and cafes and restaurants and shops and sights and cool neighborhoods -- eg, laying in a park, the beach, back in my room doing some planning, hostel common area, etc.  Then in late afternoon/early evening I like to visit places that opened later and have usually slowed down -- shops, teahouses, cafes, markets, art galleries, etc.  Then again, have an early dinner while food is freshest, service is fast, and there's hardly anyone else there.

What about nightlife and drinking?  Well, I haven't really drunk much since my first year or so of traveling.  Of course drinking is a highlight for a lot of travelers, but honestly I'd rather drink at home.  If there's a type of drink or nightlife experience I'd like -- again, I'll go early at night when again there are fewer people and faster service.  I've also found that it's a lot easier to meet and have conversations earlier on, especially local folk.  Obviously I don't go hard partying much, but once in a while I'll stay out late and wake up later, especially when there's music or another event I want to see.

I'm not a ""morning person"" at all at home.  I woke up at 10:30am this morning for example.  But, I find it a lot easier traveling since I'm usually exhausted and a little jet lagged the first day anyway, and it's easier to reset my schedule to go to bed &amp; wake up early.  I've never been able to convince travel partners to do this with me, and I'm more likely to stay out late with other travel partners, but going solo it's easy.

Anyone else have experience with successes waking up early while traveling?",solotravel,rakuu
Phone plans while traveling abroad?,"Hi everyone,

I had a quick question about picking a phone plan when I take my trip. I expect to be gone about a year and a half, so obviously I'll need a phone with data.

My two options are below:

1. Google fi - I have enough people interested that I can get the family plan and pay $45/month for unlimited data, talk, and text (data is all I care about though)

Pros:
* I get to keep my same number without having to port it over to Google voice
* Nearly worldwide coverage
* No need to get a new sim card every time I switch to another country
* Unlimited data

Cons:
* It's not very popular yet and I can't seem to find reviews from travelers
* Price, while decent, is a bit high compared to developing countries. I'll be traveling mostly in Latin America, so I'm sure I can find cheaper plans.

Option 2. Use my unlocked phone and stick a sim card in with a new plan every time I go to another country. I'd import my number to Google voice so as long as I have data, I'll be able to talk and text with people back home without a hassle.

Pros:
* Potentially cheaper
* More options for service providers

Cons:
* It will be a hassle to switch sim cards every time I enter a new country
* I'm not sure if unlimited data plans really exist in Latin America.

I'm honestly leaning towards option one due to sheer convenience, but want to know if anyone here has experience with the service.

Also, the cost of an unlimited data plan with local carriers would be a factor into my decision. Anyone have any sort of data for an unlimited plan in, say, Mexico? Maybe on Claro o Movistar?

Thank you all so much!",solotravel,Thepopewearsplaid
Suggestions for road trip from Chicago (27M),"Hi all. It looks like I'll be working from home for several more months (my company is saying until January at the earliest). Since I can work from anywhere, I'm thinking that I can travel and work remotely instead of staying at home in Chicago. Any suggestions on where I should go?

I'm thinking of going on a road trip, returning to Chicago after around 2-3 weeks. I'll still work M-F for the usual 8 hours, though I would be open to taking occasional PTO to go sightseeing or drive to my next destination. Most of my sightseeing activities will be in the evenings or weekends. I do enjoy visiting museums, but a lot of them are closed due to COVID, and I find that they're not always open in the evening. Having said that, I do enjoy sightseeing in metro areas and eating out at different restaurants. 

A lot of the northeastern states have imposed quarantine requirements, so I'll probably avoid those. International borders are still closed to tourists, so I definitely won't be driving into Canada or Mexico.

Have any of you done this recently? Any suggestions?",solotravel,za838

On top of this, there seems to be a large number of male hosts whose review section is exclusively younger women.

Budget for a one month trip to Europe?,"Hello,

I am considering a Eurotrip early next year (hopefully) and can't quite chalk out a budget.

My plan is to basically explore the cities, go on a couple of tours (only the must do ones), and drink and party. I will do hostels and eat mostly street food and some occasional dining out pretty much everywhere except for Hamburg where I will stay with my uncle and his family.

Trip report - 2 weeks (mostly) solo traveling around Costa Rica,"I have just finished 16 days travelling around the beautiful country of Costa Rica. Here is my trip report on what I did, and some tips for anyone planning something similar in the future. 

**Part 1 - Playa Guiones**

The first section of my trip was spent in the Nicoya Peninsula in NW Costa Rica. I stayed in the pretty sweet little town of Playa Guiones. It had some decent restaurants and is great if you like surfing. There aren't any hostels here to speak of, so AirBNB it was. The main reason I was here was to see the [turtles in Ostional](https://mytanfeet.com/costa-rica-national-park/ostional-wildlife-refuge-protecting-turtles/). It was a pretty awesome experience. The Olive Ridley turtles come on the beach (en-mass) to nest a few times every year. To see the number of turtles on this one beach at 5am was a pretty special experience. Interestingly, the turtles are pretty solitary creatures out at sea and only come onto the beach to lay their eggs, before returning to life alone. 

**Note on turtles:**

Best to visit early in the morning to have the best chance of seeing them. The cost to get in was approx. $20 which goes towards the conservation of these turtles. It is one of only 2 places in the world that this event happens so if you're in the area (and it is happening), I really recommend it. 

**Part 2 - Santa Teresa**

Next, I visited the small town of Santa Teresa on the southern coast of the peninsula. Unfortunately, there are no buses from the North-South of the peninsula. The only option from Playa Guiones is PG - Nicoya - Puntarenas - ferry to Paquera - bus to Cobano - bus to Santa Teresa. Should take you about 14 hours to do what could be a 3-hour drive. In ST, I stayed in the super nice [Luz de Luna](http://luzdelunahotel.com/). The place is run by a really cool Belgian guy and has these amazing little huts overlooking a great jungle garden. Seeing monkeys in the evening was pretty sweet! Here I didn't do a huge amount except explore the local area. There are ATVs that you can rent in the main town and there are loads of tide pools along the coast which are pretty cool to swim in. Again, this is a good place if you enjoy surfing! (Or yoga). 

**Part 3 - Puerto Viejo de Talamanca**

I then did a very long trip from Santa Teresa to Puerto Viejo de Limon (on the Caribbean coast). I spent a night in San José just to break up the journey. This was by far my favourite part of the whole couple of weeks. I really liked the Caribbean food (way spicier than what I was getting on the Pacific coast) and there was a lot more going on. I stayed in the pretty awesome [Rocking J's hostel](https://www.rockingjs.com/). Thanks to many recommendations on here for that! The hammocks were super cheap ($5 p/n) and the staff were super chill. The location is great - 30 second walk to the beach! Here, I mainly ate loads of awesome Caribbean chicken and fish + went to the amazing [Gandoca Manzanillo wildlife refuge](https://www.google.com/search?q=manzanillo+reserve&amp;oq=manzanillo+reserve&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l7.5640j0j9&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8) where I saw loads of toucans, macaws, sloths + loads more monkeys. To get there, I hired a bicycle from Rocking J's and cycled the 13 or so km. Apart from that, I also did quite a bit of snorkelling in the sea off Rocking J's and met some pretty cool people!

If anyone has any questions, let me know! They're normally my favourite thing to read on Reddit travel subs so hope some of you enjoyed this one. I haven't yet worked out how much it all cost but, probably, quite a lot. Costa Rica is frustratingly expensive.",solotravel,swingingpendulums

What is something nice you have done for another (traveler or local) while traveling abroad?,"I saw a post not too long ago about people being helped while on there travels and it got me thinking the other way around and paying it forward. So I'll go first:

When I was in Italy and Vernazza with my bro, we were hiking up to the top to catch the sunset on the town (iconic pic) and on our return we helped an elderly lady. It was getting very dark and she could get her door closed and lock it. We used our lights and tried for like 10min! I was able to understand little and used my spanish (some words overlap I think) and then held her hand and walked her down to town! She thanked us and we went on our way. I would hope someone would assist my grandma if she needed help! 

Sometimes it is the small things that we think are insignificant that add up and matter. Came across a good quote I saw...

I would like to hike alone and not rely on tour agencies or groups. 

I am not attached to any area of the country. I will go where the mountains are. 

This is what I learned about Mexico so far

1. Transportation outside of major cities is often unreliable. 
2. Trails are not crowded as there is not really a hiking culture among the locals.
3. There were incidences of tourists being robbed on even the most popular trails. 

What I would like to learn more about

1. From anyone who arranged their own transportation around Mexico, what options did you use?
2. From anyone who hiked in Mexico, where did you go? What was your experience like?",solotravel,tothet92
How to travel across Asia? (in 2021),"Hello fellow travellers. I have no doubt this question has been posted here before. 

I’m planning on traveling as much of Asia as humanly possible in 2021 (if the corona situation is better) for about 6 months or longer if possible.

I’ve got 15,000 USD with me but I was wondering what the best route would be to take? I plan to do a lot of the traveling on the ground as opposed to flights. I’ll take a flight only if I have to, but I have all the time in the world so I don’t mind long train/bus/bike journeys. 

In terms of what I’m doing, I don’t have much of a plan. I’d like to just explore most of the countries, off the beaten path type of thing. Mainly looking for the best routes from country to country. 

Would love some help from someone who has either done it before, or someone who knows their way around a map geographically. 

And any advice would be appreciated. I’ve been to Asia a few times before but this is the longest/most ambitious trip I’ll be doing in my life. Thanks!",solotravel,-RaisedByWolves-
I am very pessimistic right now.,"I really was hopeful about next year and years after next about traveling and doing my own thing but I feel like it will be least likely due to covid and just other things going on in this country. I had my mind set on visiting my first foreign country which is South Korea and to either work or study there but my family is telling me that it is not possible to go alone as a woman because its not safe to go outside the country. Should I listen to them?

Edit:I just want to point out that I wanted to travel to said country and then think about living somewhere else but much later on but I do not think it will be possible in the coming years due to Covid. Also I have  been asked if my family controls my life and they dont control most of my life. Since I am a very small woman, they dont care if I go by myself out in public like to the store,work, or just taking a walk but they dont think I could be safe traveling both in and outside my country(which is the US).

Where to travel in US during xmas?,"I get two weeks off for xmas-new years break and i am considering traveling inside the US. I live in new england and my state is allowing travelers to return if they quarantine for two weeks or if they get a negative result test. My job is under the same rules. Id like to travel for the first week and use the second week to wait on my COVID result so i dont lose days at my job since i havent stopped going into the office.

**In the US I have already traveled to:**
- Los Angeles
-San Diego
-Boston
-NYC

**Length**
5-9 days depending on costs

**Budget**
Not trying to overspend. I would like to be around 1000-1500 for flight + hotel. And then waste no more than 1000  (tickets, food, activities, car rental).

**Climate**
Since i already live in a cold state. I would like visit a warm city. 

**Interests**
- Food:a place with good local food. I dont care much for the big time places, i like finding local places that are well known to the locals and may not be known outside the city. 
- Outdoors: I like a good hike as well as good beaches. The place doesnt have to be near the coast though.

**Safety**
Im not too worried about safety since i would be still in the country but since it may be a solo travel safety would be a considerable

**cities im considering**

Where did your wanderlust come from?,"During Covid I'm taking some time to reflect why I am getting so crazy being cooped up in 1 place. Where did all that wanderlust come from? Is my desire to travel only driven by social media and blogs? I would love to hear where yours come from.

After some reflections I realise a lot of mine just came from my nature and childhood experience. 

Since 7 yrs old ( mid 90s') I often travel with my sport team to other provinces to compete. Air travel was not popular back then, so we mainly travel by train, and in case you didn't already know, train travelling through Vietnam is one of the best rides in the whole world. The scenery always excited me, and I couldn't stop dreaming of jumping out of train alone to experience the landscape, to climb down the cliffs to touch the ocean, to walk among the endless lush forests and hills, to sample all the weird dishes by the vendors at every station in every province.

My dad also had a globe and I often fantasized being in different parts of the world, and back in the 90s information and imageries were scarce, so my imagination of the world was actually very different from reality.

Being in a new strange place always excited me more than scaring me. During middle school I sometimes cycled 20km to the border of my city and that alone gave my the thrills.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that I can now understand that my decision to travel was largely innerself-driven rather being influenced by marketing. I would also urge my fellow travellers to think about what drives you, so that you may find the experiences that truly make you happy when travelling :)",solotravel,reginafilange89

How can I travel the US after scrapping my initial travel plan?,"Hi solo travelers, my initial plan was to convert a box truck into a camper and travel the country for my semester or two off of college (hopefully before the west coast burns down). I got scammed on the box truck purchase and I need to sell it since it has major issues, but I still want to see as much of America’s beauty as possible before I have to go back to university in a few months. I have already lost a few thousand dollars on the box truck investment and am a relatively poor individual but have still saved enough as a student to do a trip like this. 

How can I do this on a budget? I considered sleeping in my car or even buying a cheap trailer to tow behind it to sleep in so that I could avoid hotel costs, and so that I’d be able to camp at national parks more easily. 

Do you guys have any advice? I’m desperate for help here as I am trying to find my way in life, do some self-searching, and discover my true passions before I commit to a career path out of college. I’m aware there are major issues inhibiting travel such as covid, divisive conflict, and natural disasters, but this journey is incredibly important to me and I feel pressed for time to accomplish it since I can’t take more than two semesters off of school without losing my scholarship.

Trip report - solo road trip - Minnesota to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks,"Here is my trip report, driving from Minneapolis to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, Sept. 11 through Sept. 18, 2020. I am a solo traveler on this trip, driving my Kia Optima, camping in a tent, and eating food that I’m bringing along. I’m a married father of two girls, and this is my first major solo trip. I visited YNP with my wife and kids last summer, and haven’t been to GTNP since I was about age 3. 

DAY 1 - FRIDAY. Plan: Drive home to Teddy Roosevelt NP

Had to switch to Plan B immediately after leaving the house because Beartooth Pass was still closed when I left home. So reversed my route and driving toward the Bighorn Mountains instead. Drove 830 miles in 13 hours from Minneapolis area to Ten Sleep, WY. Took the loop through Badlands NP in South Dakota and bought my annual pass. Camped at Ten Sleep RV Park, and walked to Ten Sleep Brewing for an evening beer. Saw one cow moose in the Bighorns.

DAY 2 - SATURDAY. Plan: Drive Ten Sleep to Cooke City, MT

Making it all the way to Ten Sleep on day 1 allowed me to take my time getting to Cooke City, where I had a reservation at the Alpine Hotel (no camping due to bears). Departed Ten Sleep at 7am. Drove east back through Ten Sleep Canyon to see it going the other way. Then north to Sheridan, WY for a grocery stop. Next was back through the Bighorns on 14 to 14A, another amazing drive! Checked into the Alpine Hotel, and then headed into YNP for wolf viewing in the evening. Headed to Slough Creek and waited for wolves for two hours, but none were around. Headed back toward Cooke City, and found the Butte Junction wolves (and group of people) there. There were also two grizzly bear right with the wolves, with one wolf following each grizzly. The wolf and grizzly would interact occasionally, it was really neat!

DAY 3 - SUNDAY. Plan: Hike, Mammoth, Hike, end at Madison Campground

Left Cooke City at 615am. Watched the Junction Butte wolfpack again in Lamar Valley. Hiked to Hellroaring Creek, 4.32 miles RT (excellent hike with meadows, woods, ascents and descents). Hiked Mammoth Hot Springs including walking the driving loop, 3.76 miles total. Hiked the Norris Geyser Basin, 2.49 miles total. Drove Firehole Lake Drive, saw White Dome Geyser erupt. Drove out to West Yellowstone to get gas and to call my wife. On the way, watched a bull elk and his ~20 cows along the Madison River. Checked into my campsite at Madison Campground for 2 nights there. I was starting to get a bit tired, but it was too early to stay at camp, so I went for a short drive. I’m so glad I did! At Madison Junction in the Gibbon River, there was a crowd watching something, and I caught a glimpse of a moose heading into the woods. I stopped, and for the next two hours I followed the bull moose and two cows (from a safe distance of course). They stayed in the woods for a while, but I knew they would head back to the river, and eventually they did. They put on a great show! Be sure to watch the video in my album, it was a trip highlight!

DAY 4 - MONDAY. Plan: Hike, tour, geyser watch in YNP

Left Madison at 7am. Drove to Old Faithful area, and watched OF at 745am with just a handful of people. From there, hiked to Mallard Lake, 7.75 miles RT (nice hike with no other people). Walked the Upper Geyser Basin – saw Grand Geyser, Daisy, Lion (twice), OF from Beehive. Then I took a break in the car because Riverside was predicted in about 2.5 hours. As I sat in my car, I watched herds of people and cars, and got frustrated – all of that commotion wasn’t what I wanted. Did some research and found a backup – hiked up Purple Mountain, 6.49 miles RT (challenging climb, great view, few people). Drove Firehole Canyon Drive, and took a dip in the river. Drove to Grand Prismatic in the evening, but there were so many people still there so I didn’t stop.

DAY 5 - TUESDAY. Plan: Drive to GTNP, get campsite, hike to Delta Lake

Left Madison at 640am, and drove toward GTNP via Canyon and Hayden Valley. Saw 5 elk including two bulls, all of them were solo. In GTNP, stopped at Mormon Row and the TA Moulton barn. Drove to Gros Ventre to get a campsite. I waited in line for about 30 minutes, and finally got a site for 3 nights at about 10am. Headed out for the hike of the day – Lupine Meadows TH to Delta Lake. 8.5 miles RT, 2457 feet elevation gain. Fun, challenging hike, with an amazing view at the end, but Delta Lake is no “secret” hike. Then relaxed at the campsite in the evening.

DAY 6 - WEDNESDAY. Plan: Hike Cascade Canyon to Lake Solitude

Depart Gros Ventre at 605am headed to String Lake TH. Hiked String Lake, through Cascade Canyon, to Lake Solitude, and back. 16.79 miles total with 2670 feet of elevation gain. This was an AMAZING hike! I loved it so much – the views in the North Fork toward Lake Solitude are wonderful. Spent about an hour at Lake Solitude enjoying the scenery, ate lunch, saw a fox trot along the lake, and I swam to the small wooded island! The water was so cold but so energizing. In the evening, relaxed at the campsite, and walked around Gros Ventre campground – 2.71 miles total.

DAY 7 - THURSDAY. Plan: Hike Paintbrush Canyon to Holly Lake

Depart Gros Ventre at 6am toward String Lake TH. Hiked Paintbrush Canyon, and continued up toward Paintbrush Divide because I wanted to get over 10,000 ft. elevation. Paintbrush Canyon was really neat, and a different type of hike than Cascade Canyon. I saw one black bear, and a bull elk with two cows. Once over 10,000, I figured I should just go up to the Divide. After I got over the small glacier and saw the final ascent and evaluated my water situation, I decided not to go up to the Divide. Headed back down to destination #2, Holly Lake. Jumped into Holly Lake and talked to 4 other hikers there for a while, then returned to String Lake. 16.42 miles total, 3562 foot elevation gain. Afterward, I got my only restaurant food of the trip – a takeout pizza from Dornans, and it was really good. In the evening, relaxed at the campsite, took a dip/rinse in the Gros Ventre river, and walked along the Gros Ventre river and saw one cow moose.

DAY 8 - FRIDAY. Plan: Drive toward home including Beartooth Pass

Depart Gros Ventre at 6am. Drove north through YNP, exited NE entrance. Saw a few elk, many bison (duh!), a coyote in Lamar Valley. Drove over Beartooth Pass (saw three mountain goats), had a beer at Red Lodge Alex, and made it to Medora, ND Red Trail Campground at 7pm.
DAY 9 - SATURDAY. Plan: Drive TRNP and to home
Depart Red Trail Campground at 615am. Drove through Teddy Roosevelt NP for a while (saw wild turkey, prairie dogs, a lot of mule deer including four bucks). Then headed home, arriving here at 5pm.

SUMMARY:

On the trip, I really wanted to focus on good and challenging hikes away from the crowds, and I found that! The parks were very busy and popular parking spots were over-crowded. Getting just a mile or so away from the roads pays dividends! I also wanted to see wildlife, and wildlife cooperated.

The weather was amazing. Fire haze would settle in every day – mornings started out clear and it generally got hazier at the day went on. High temps were 75-80, lows at night 30-35, very little wind.

While driving, I listened to a lot of podcasts, which seemed to make the driving go much faster than music. 

Thank you for reading! I’d love to answer any questions. I could provide a lot more commentary, but don’t want to bore everyone. In the end, amazing trip, and I really want to do more mountain hiking and would like to do a backcountry trip.",solotravel,PiBrickShop
Have you ever been ignored in places for travelling solo?,"I have been travelling solo for some and for the first time I was ignored. 

Because of covid, I decided to travel in my own country and booked an hotel in the beach, all inclusive. I really needed to be alone and to get some rest and in september there is not lots of people on vacation.

Today at dinner, I have waited for 25 minutes to get some food and was ignored by the staff. Even asking for water. The groups around me were always being served foods and drinks. after 45 minutes finally the guy that gave me my table talked to me. When I entered he said ""poor you, you are alone"" and he remained with the same kind of speech. He even said that because I was complaining I was making him feel bad...I had answered ""imagine how i felt being ignored for all the staff all this time"", got up, left and went to purchase dinner next door.

Little ramble/ story,"I first started traveling 2 years ago.  My first actual solo travel trip was Thailand. I stayed there for 3 weeks and loved it.  The food, the beaches, the chaos, and the freedom.  But I didn’t meet a single other traveler until my last day, I made no effort to.  I didn’t realize meeting people was one of the best parts about traveling.  Now since then I’ve been on 5 other trips and my first goal when arriving is to get some good food, and meet some people at the hostel.  

Before traveling I was sort of shy, awkward and self conscious.  

Now I’m way more outgoing, and I enjoy being around new people and learning their story. 

People say they want to travel to “find themselves” and I’m not saying I did “that” but once I made the effort to get out of my comfort zone it seriously had a impact on my life.  

I’m super motivated now, organized and overall more successful in everyday life because of traveling.",solotravel,USA631

American SouthWest in January -- Recs + Budget tips,"Hi Everyone,

Starting to plan for some travel in January-- thinking it would be fun to road trip for Vegas and hit some national parks (Grand Canyon, Zion, Bryce...). Nothing specific set right now as I am just exploring options. I would love to hear from someone who has done this sort of trip in Winter. I'm thinking it would be easiest to rent a campervan (I've found a reasonably priced rental for $50 a day) so that way I don't have to worry too much about camping in cold weather. Are there ample spots to park camper vans? Or would I have to be pay for a campsite every night? Or, do you have any different recs on doing this on a budget (in winter)? 

Would love to hear about overall highlights + lowlights of people who have done this sort of trip! Also, any resources for trip planning would be appreciated (books/ blogs). I'm an avid hiker and excited to explore!

"TRIP REPORT: Playa del Carmen, Mexico (September)","I am sharing some current information about the Quintana Roo region since I am here now. Also willing to answer any questions if I missed something you are curious about.

**Background**: 

Lease ran out, packed stuff into storage and decided to work remotely from here indefinitely, starting September 7th.

**Atmosphere:** 

Most locals wear masks, usually it is the foreigners that don't. Having said that, there does not seem to be that much concern for COVID, at least at this point, compared to what I experienced in cities in the US.

People have their temperature checked and are given hand sanitizer before entering stores or eating at restaurants, etc.

As of Mexican Independence Day, clubs were open until 2AM  or later and bars have bands/music playing.

Traffic is down and there is a major shortage of parties in places like Tulum, etc. Tulum in general felt very empty.

**Sights/Activities:**

All of the cenotes are open as far as I know, with the same precautions as stores (temperature and sanitizer). Tulum and Coba ruins opened last week and I think Chichen Itza opens today. There is a maximum capacity or visitor limit I believe.

Scuba diving is happening and the beaches are open.

**People:**

The travelers I meet are mostly from North/South America and Europe, though I have met Asian ones as well. Tons of people doing the COVID nomad thing.

**Flights:**

I flew on American with a layover in Miami. Social distancing wasn't observed but otherwise the flights left and landed on time with no issues. The flight to Miami was full and the flight to Cancun maybe 65% full.

**Accommodation:**

Marked down a lot. So far I've stayed in Airbnb apartments, hotels and hostel dorms.

Hotel - Wouldn't know COVID existed except for front desk employees wearing masks and using hand sanitizer.

Airbnb - Hand sanitizer, masks.

Hostel dorms - Full or 50% capacity depending on the rules of the place. Only real issues have been a mildew smell if anything.

**Fitness:**

Gyms have reopened and the one I am going to only requires a temperature check and a mask to enter but optional basically when working out so nobody wears one.

**Dating:**

The first week was a bit much. Polar opposite of the action I got from March to May.

**Summary:**

If you are not very concerned about contracting COVID, this is the place to be. My mental health has improved 50X and I couldn't be happier to be out of the US for now, especially with Winter and Elections approaching.",solotravel,RICH_PINNA

Never Booking With Booking.com Book Directly,"I had booked about two months in advance for a trip I had planned to Monterrey/Big Sur for mid September. As the date approached for the trip wildfires started to break out around the area around mid August. These fires were bad and were making air quality horrible and were getting close to the hotel we were staying at. It was counterintuitive to stay somewhere so close to the fires only to just stay indoors the whole time, or worst get stuck out there 2-3 hours away from home.  


Although our stay was still a few weeks away, I made the decision to try to cancel the booking because there was no sign the fires would let up, they did not let up even on the date of our booking. I couldn't have known that and the hotel/booking.com couldn't have known that either, but judging on how bad the fires were and still are, they refused to refund my money.  


The property we were staying at told us specifically that we had to deal with booking.com in order to get our refund. Upon contacting them they then told us that we had to deal with the property directly in order to get our refund. This back and forth lasted for a good hour. That's not an exaggeration. An hour of back and forth trying to reason with booking.com. The property made it clear that on their end, they had not received any payment and that since I booked with a third party (booking.com), they were the ones responsible in issuing me a refund. Even if the property wanted to they couldn't refund me money they hadn't received.  


Making this very clear to the handful of representatives at booking.com that ""assisted"" me, they insisted that the property was the one responsible in issuing me my refund. You can see how infuriating it is when all they did was throw their hands up and tried to shoe me away when clearly stating to them there was no money to return on the property's behalf. They stated that because the property did not clear the transaction they had nothing to give back to me. So my question is now, current day, where did my money go? Of course to booking.com.  


I am now out the money I paid for a reservation we never attended and despite filing a claim they still won the case and kept my money. Stay far away from booking.com. I'm not sure how it is getting refunded with other third party booking agencies, but definitely do not book with booking.com. Whatever money you think you're saving it's not worth it. Just book directly with the property and save yourself the frustration and financial stress of giving your money to a company whose interest is not with the customer but with their own pockets.",solotravel,CenturyOldMilk
Tourist and backpacker density by country,"Having traveled solo in a number of countries; I’d say the density of tourism in a place really has an effect on your experience. It’s not that more tourists is necessarily a bad thing, while I felt a place like Rome was rather overcrowded, I loved the social atmosphere and ease of meeting fellow solo travelers in a tourist-dense country like Thailand. Conversely, being in a place with few tourists can often feel more exotic and unspoilt, but can also lead to feeling bored or lonely.

Should I go solo after breakup?,"UPDATE: thank you so much everyone for taking the time to respond. I ended up cancelling and the cancellation fee actually ended up being $400. Not too shabby. Someone mentioned that if I went alone, I would be paying an extra $1,250 for the trip (covers the ex’s cost) and that sealed it for me. When the time is right, I’ll save that money to go solo to a place where I’ve always wanted to go alone — Japan! 

EDIT: sorry, probably posted in wrong sub. 

My relationship just ended before our trip to an all-inclusive resort in Riviera Maya, Mexico, at the end of next month. Debating whether I should still go. I would lose $500 for canceling but would get ~$2,000 back. $500 is a lot to lose. 

I don’t want to ask my ex to help cover the loss if I decide to cancel because I booked the trip and paid for it all as his birthday gift. I also make more than him so I wouldn’t want him to pay and on top of that, he was against going in the first place. Although, as time went on, he was really excited about going. 

In the grand scheme of things, is a $500 loss a lot versus going alone especially during these stupid COVID times?

NYC solo travel. Good idea??,"I have a break from Sept. 25-30. I don’t really know what to do! I mean I’ve been hiking with my friends, but I miss traveling. I canceled two trips to Europe this year. My first vacation was supposed to be my first solo trip in Finland &amp;amp; Estonia and the second vacation was suppose to be in France with friends. 
Also, I was planning to take my dad to NYC for his birthday, but since he is immunocompromised, we decided it’s not a great idea to take him to NYC (will take him there once we get the vaccine) 
Anyway, I’m 26 years old (male) and a nurse, so COVID doesn’t really scare as much and will wear the proper precaution to protect myself &amp;amp; others. Since I live alone, I can quarantine once I get back. I just want to go somewhere. I’m from NM and the infection rate is about the same as NY. So I feel more comfortable vs going to states like TX or FL. 
I just want to know if someone has experience solo traveling recently to NYC (or even before COVID) and give advice to someone who has anxiety about solo travel. Thanks!",solotravel,False-Mood
What's up with..,"..all these posts asking for ways to meet people, find group activities, etc. Is there not a pandemic going on? Do you just don't believe it, or are you too selfish to care? Have I imagined this whole thing? Am I taking crazy pills?

For the record I think in the U.S. at least you can travel solo being relatively safe if you take the proper precautions and keep to yourself. Camping, takeout, washing hands, social distancing, wearing a mask. But seeking out groups and activities? These are the people that are going to make this second wave in the fall so much worse. 200k people already dead in the U.S. and people in this subreddit are talking about what they should do for new years.

Planning trip to Central Europe once covid is done,"Hey there, I'm a 20 year old from Canada. Obviously right now is not the best time to travel, but once covid is done in a year or two and it is safe to travel, I'd love to visit the world. I think that for my first trip I'll go to central europe. 

From my research these seem to be the best cities in central europe. What do y'all think?

\- Berlin

\- Budapest. 

\- Prague. 

\- Vienna. 

\- Krakow. 

\- Amsterdam. 

Is this correct? 

What cities would you guys add to a trip like this, and how many days would you recommend spending in each city? 

The big factors for me are the following: Great nightlife, great places to visit during the day too, making friends (hostels are great for this I hear). 

Is the language barrier big in those cities? I'm fluent in english and in french, thats it. 

Finally, financials are important for me too. I don't want to go to cities that are too expensive. I'm just a student so maybe I'll have about 5 thousand canadian dollars for this trip. If I spend 5 days in 6 cities, that's 30 days. What do you guys think?",solotravel,MorphyvsCarlsen

Car Camping,"Hi there!
This is my first post anywhere on this app, so please ignore any missed nuances.

I’m looking to do a solo roadtrip next summer. This trip will probably span the majority of the United States, and I plan to sleep in my car most of the time, maybe a campsite in a National park here and there.

Currently I have a 2008 Toyota 4Runner, but it’s dying and probably won’t last a roadtrip of the length I want to go.

Is there anyone on here that’s gone car camping and has a car that’s good for that? My research is leading me towards the Nissan Pathfinder or an old Jeep Cherokee. But research only does so much, I would like to have some real experience input.
Thank you so much.",solotravel,Taxation-is-thievery
Advice for long term travel this winter,"Hello! I’m a 22 year old American man planning to travel around Europe from November-March. My parents are currently living in England and I’ll be going to see them in November. My seasonal job allows me several months off, so I would like to stay in Europe the entire time. i have the time and money to make this work and enough saved for emergencies and returning home. Obviously there are quarantine mandates when entering new countries and the possibility of certain areas closing entirely if rates increase. For this reason I’ll probably stay in each country I visit for 3 weeks-1 month, possibly more. 

Does anyone have recommendations for how to travel safely and ethically during this time? i’d like to spend lots of time in rural areas, camping, and volunteering on farms rather than being in crowded cities and putting others and myself at risk. 

I also plan on living as frugally as possible during this time. not because I have to, but because I want to. For example, camping/hostels/work exchange for a room. dumpster diving for food. hitchhiking rather than taking planes and trains. Has anyone done these things around Europe in the COVID era? What did you learn? 

If anyone has other recommendations for how to bum it around Europe during a pandemic, I’m all ears. peace n love, y’all",solotravel,jyow13
Good winter sports hostels in Europe? (Mostly skiing related),"Hi guys!

At the end of this year, I want to go solo skiing somewhere in the alps. Usually, I went with other people and we just rented or stayed in a small house somewhere. However, this time no one wants to join me so I am planning on going alone. Because I do like some social interaction I am looking for good hostels that allow me to do that.

I tried to Google but I don't think there are many hostels aimed towards this, which isn't a problem because I am free to go wherever I want and can. I know hostels are a bit of a problem in these times but I am willing to try it assuming I get some socializing out of it, but hostels that do take the corona rules into account are a big plus.

What I am looking for is pretty simple, close to skiing areas (or close to free transport) and a place to store my skiing gear. It would be awesome if there are other (somewhat) extreme things to do like ice climbing or snow kiting.

If you have tips, or just fun stories, please share! 🤗",solotravel,Taronyuuu

Good cities to WFH for a month? (USA),"Basically, I am looking to get out of town for up to a month.

I'm currently in Chicago and am willing to drive up to 14 hours to get to wherever I'm going (don't feel comfortable flying just yet). Thinking of going for the month of October but it's still flexible. Some things that I'm looking for are:


* Decent weather (nothing below freezing) 

* Moderately affordable (although frankly I'm willing to drop a couple grand, just not looking for NYC/Chicago/LA prices)

* Something to enjoy outdoors (beaches, parks, good architecture)

* Enough restaurants that I can get a variety of takeout

I've been thinking of finding some place on the Gulf Coast and just spending all of my time aside from work hanging out on the beach, but I haven't spent any time there before and I want to get some other opinions before I pull the trigger on something. 

Important to note that no matter where I end up, I will be practicing social distancing. I'll be visiting on my own and don't plan to do any indoor activities other than grocery shopping and I will respect all local mandates. I'll also do a full two week quarantine when I return.

How to solo travel while in a relationship?,"Sharing my travel plans (after COVID obviously) with my partner &amp; realizing that we have very different travel goals for the future. 

He doesn’t like traveling for extended periods of time / has a dog so doesn’t want to leave for long, while I want to do multiple multi-month trips on a budget, and even live abroad for an extended period of time teaching English. 

It makes me sad because I don’t like doing long distance relationships, but don’t want to break up with someone for that reason right now during the pandemic when traveling isn’t even a possibility. I was also excited thinking of traveling together, but all those hopes were dashed when he flat out said no to my mapped out trips.

"Solo traveling for almost two years. More or less stuck in S.E.A. due to Covid. Looking for feedback, advice, thoughts, etc. Slight vent.","Throwaway.

Just at a point where I'm trying to sort through my options moving forward. Obviously options are limited but would greatly appreciate feedback/advice from this community incase others may know something I haven't thought of. I'll try to give a quick rundown.

Almost two years ago I quit my job in the States and started to travel. Arrived in Vietnam late February and then boom. For three months there were no international flights. Some are operating now but are a bit unreliable due to loads of cancellations. Boarders are still closed, indefinitely. Obviously I cannot travel the way I did before. There is nothing back in the States for me (no job, home, etc.) and frankly I'd rather not return anytime soon due to the...lackluster...response to Covid. EU is out of the question because U.S. citizens are not being granted access to travel/visit. Even so, they aren't accepting flights from Vietnam which is strange considering how well this country has done during the pandemic, containment wise. I'm aware Britain and Ireland are still taking us Yanks but that could change at any moment.

As mentioned, Vietnam has done almost remarkably well during these times with managing the virus. Even with the recent second wave. After one month it seems almost totally stabilized. I quite like it here but damn the climate has been a really getting to me (was only planning on three weeks!).  I've talked with other ex pats here but I'm not very well integrated with the community. To be honest, not that interested in it. Simmering in your own thoughts these times can be a bit taxing and sometimes feels pointless.

Just renewed my visa for another three months. I would love to hear what you folks would do if in my position because I'm sort of hitting a wall trying to come up with something. Should I just hang until this ""blows over""? Try my options elsewhere if possible and relatively safe? Pretty much have zero obligations and prospects in life at the moment.

When traveling solo and staying at a hostel is it easier to make friends being a girl or guy or does it not matter?,"I’ve been lurking at this sub and have recently thought about the idea of solo traveling.

This however just got me thinking about whether it’s easier to be a girl or guy when solo traveling being at a hostel in terms of making friends and joining other groups.

[Report] 7 days in Northern Italy.,"A while ago I made a post with a title like ""7-10 days trip in Northern Italy"". Here's my report. Be prepared, it's long. I'll start with what I saw and did, then will do a small part on my mood and mental health during th e trip. 

First, thank you all for the advices. I'm still in the trip, but have only one day left which will be for chilling and no intense visiting.

Also, it's Italy. It's always a good idea to go to Italy. 

My initial plan was : Milan - Lake como - Bergamo - Lake Garda - Lake iseo. 

MILAN
-----------

I started with 2 days in Milan. I have friends there, so it was an obvious staring point. My Italian friends there don't like the city, but I quite enjoyed it. I have to admit that for once, the covid situation is making things better as there are less tourists, and hotel prices are lower. I stayed at the hotel Flora near the central station. 55€/night. Not good, not bad. OK for solo. I really enjoyed the city. The architecture, the different neighbourhoods, the people,... Really loved it (my feet after 26km,a bit less). I saw the Duomo of course, which was pretty much empty. Really impressing, and the galleries near it as well. I did pretty much all the Da Vinci museums / places, except the church with the last supper, as it was closed for the afternoon (?!). I also did a lot of churches, parks, places, the Milan University (where you can have beers every night right in front the beautiful main building), etc. 
I spent the last evening in the navigli area, with a beautiful sunset over the river and the colorfull bars and restaurants. I then moved to Lake Como. 

LAKE COMO
-------------------


I had booked 2 nights in Bellagio, at the hotel Fioroni. Around 65€/night, family run. Really nice place, had a double room for myself with a tiny balcony, absolutely stunning view on the mountains, could see a bit of the lake on my left. Just imagine, waking up, having the sunrise on the yellow houses and the lush green mountains, with an absolute silence. 
Paradise. Good breakfast too and free parking. 
15 minutes walk from the city center, either by following the road with view on the lake, or from inside the village, which makes you arrive on the other side of bellagio. 
This city/village is really really great and beautiful. More tourists than in Milan though, on a Sunday evening. The Monday was totally empty. Amazing food, stunning view on the lake. 

For food, try the enoteca cava turaciolo. Simple and good set of cheese and ham, but it's the wine that you go there for. I took a tester of 3 wines, 2 reds and one white. One of the red just blew my mind. Sfurzat carlo negrid. Just, wow. Waiter took the time to explain the origins, how to pour it properly, and we descussed a bit. 

All the little narrow streets are super cute, and for the Instagram fans, that's where you can take a lot of the empty narrow streets pictures. 

The next day, I went to visit Como. Quite nice town, about an hour drive from Bellagio. They have an hydroplane club, nice and cute city center. The Duomo is quite impressive as well, but that's for the walk on the pedestrian alongside the big villas that you go there. Simply beautiful. Makes you wish the time stops. I just stayed an one bench for 20 minutes, lookking at the opposite side of the lake, without thinking to anything. Only disturbed by a chopper bringing construction material to what i guess is the future villa of a rich person. 

Then I drove to cernobbio. Equally beautiful and much more peaceful, but smaller. I also could have gone there on foot from como. I did not stayed there too long, but still enjoyed it. And, as everywhere on Lake como, the view is just splendid. 

The last evening I went back to my hotel in bellagio, and I went for supper to the hotel métropole. I wish I had not. I should have checked Google before. I just saw they had the traditional fish risotto from that area. They rushed everything, I got the dish while I still had my aperitivo. Then the wine. I ordered the same whine I had the day before (the surfzat) at the enoteca. They did not serve me what I ordered. I got a low grade headache-inducing shitty wine. The fish on the plate was, I'm pretty sure, reheated in a micro wave oven. That really took my mood down. Shame because I was in a pretty good spirit by then.

At least, I could enjoy one of the most beautiful sunset I've ever seen in my life. 

 Anyway, I got the fuck out of there and we t back to my hotel, prepping for the next day, which was departure day to Bergamo, just for the day and spent the night in garda, on the lake of the same name. 

When I woke up, I did not want to go to Bergamo. I was just too in harmony with the lake como, and I wanted to see the villa del barbianello, which I could not visit before as it was closed on Mondays. So I figured, let's go to varena, and take a boat trip from there. 

The drive was really enjoyable, loads of little cute villages. 

When I arrived in varenna, I was instantly charmed by the place. This is the typical lakeshore village, absolutely stunning, cute, loving, *insert any adjective here*. I absolutely love the place. Made me think I want to spend my retirement there. 

As the streets are a bit narrow, not many tourists still felt like a bit more than in the other places. But it's as idealistic as you could expect. 

Got a pizza at the bar il molo. Fairly priced, and OK for quality. Spirits are cheap too. The ice cream was ginormous and cheap. 

In the end, I did not go to the villa del barbianello, as I'd prefer spending more time in Varenna. 

But still, around 3pm,i had to take the road for the 2hours drive to Garda. 


LAKE GARDA
---------------------

The drive to Garda (the city) was a bit less pleasant then around Lake Como, but that was expected, as it's a good chunk of highway.

Instantly, I felt like I should have started with garde then como, as the landscape is quite a downgrade. Don't get me wrong, it's also really nice and beautifully, but the scenes are less grandiose than on Lake como.

Many many more tourists there, and if the prices are much lower than on lake como, the quality is too. The bars are more rushed. Hotel is meh. 

I'm not feeling confortable here. I want to leave. I'm writing these lines ""enjoying"" a spritz on the harbor.

One think that is really nice, is the sunset. There a small cliff going down slowly to the water surface and the sun drops being it, showing you wonderful colors and a stunning view. Can't complain about that at all.

I've been trying to go to a restaurant two times, but it seems like they don't like solo travellers. That pissed me off more than I'd care to say, because I really wanted to go there. 

Tomorrow will be driving to lake iseo, a hotel in iseo and a short night before going to the airport around 5m to come back to my no-so-sweet Belgium.

MENTAL HEALTH
---------------------------

first of all, I'm not what we can say a very stable person. I have my moods, and they can change quite quickly. That being said, I'm still quite rational or I'm trying to be.

If you've read what i wrote before, you've deduced that everything was going pretty well until that first disgusting restaurant in Bellagio. That started to bring my spirit down. But I spoke to friends through fb and it went OK.

Globally, I chilled while I Was visiting everything, stopped when I wanted to stop, ignored what I wanted to ignored, and just did wathever I wanted without caring for anything or anyone. This is a wonderful feeling.

I did not go into deep thoughts. Just left a blank in my brain. Looking to nature or whatever was in front of me, and to nothing else.

Basic rule, don't look at your emails. Don't look at the news. Cut yourself from everything. I've partially failed at that for the news. But did not checked my mails.

Now, in garda, my mood is really down. I just want to be over with this place. Not enjoying it at all. I went to sirmione today, but Barelystayed 2h,to see and go.

Yesterday evening I just took spritz on spritz, not being drunk, but just to occupy my mind. Which is not good. I told my self I'd not do that today... Well, I've just finished my second one. But I'll go for food now and not take alcohol.

I just don't know what to think, or how to improve my frequent depressed mood. 

One think that cheers me up for after the trip though, is that through a friend we have in comon, we'll go to a concert with a girl a fancy. (My friend will be there too, but that's totally ok).

Now the sun Is slowly going down, revealing a beautiful scene, and that's cool.

CONCLUSIONS
------------------------

some places were lovely, others stunning, others not so much. But overall a quite nice stay.

I guess I have to work a bit more on my mindset and how to improve it to enjoy more the time I spend alone, and go over micro setbacks more easily.

I haven't met anyone, and did not desire too, so that's cool.

I've probably left things aside, so feel free to ask any questions.

Cheers.


Edit : here's the report for the last 1.5 days.

So last day I went to the lake iseo, as it was planned originally and I've often seen online that it's sort of a hidden gem.

It is.

There an island (actually, 3 islands) in the lake, one being much more massive than the others (like it is 9km circonference). It's quite lovely, and the water is really clear. Haven't seen anyone swimming though. I went on the island with the ferry from sulzano. 5.5€ for a return ticket, takes 5 minutes to go to the other side. Runs every 20 min.
 Monte Isola, the big island, is really lovely. Nice colors, quite chill. Again, September + covid made it quite empty of tourists, just a few here and there.

I did not do the whole tour of the island, nor the climb up the castle. I was following my feet, and they brought me halfway up, then wanted to go back down and have a beer, enjoy the view and the very warm weather.

I spent in total something like 2h there, but it's worth spending more. Apparently in June and July they place some floating paths between the islands, so you don't have to take the boat. They were not installed anymore yesterday.

After taking the ferry back to sulzano, I went to the charming little village of Iseo, where I had booked my last hotel. Hotel ambra, 65€/night. Quite nice actually. Had to wake up at 4.30 to gety plane in milano, and they offered early check out and breakfast by the on duty person for the night. Really appreciated.

Iseo itself looks quite touristic, but the inside has some old style Italian feelings, which I always like.

Just spent the evening looking at the lake, got a nice (big!) ham cuts as starter and a pizza as main, to properly end up my Italian stay (had the pasta yesterday at the bussola restaurant in Garda).

Now, enjoying an iced coffee at the only Starbucks in Italy at milano malpenza Airport, waiting for my flight.

[REPORT] Greece is awesome right now!,"Just got home from 12 days in Greece on Monday. One of the best trips I've ever had. I visited Athens, Crete and Thessaloniki. What makes it special is there are barely any tourists anywhere. No line ups or waiting for anything. Everything is open and the locals are starving for your business. No restrictions anywhere due to the virus, except for the mask in the grocery store, but other then that everything is open. Do not miss this once in a lifetime opportunity!!",solotravel,fargonwanderer
Question about airport security at JFK,"Hello everyone,

I have my first international trip coming up and I had a couple of questions hopefully someone can answer.
I have two tickets booked with two separate airlines since there is no option for a connection ticket with the trip I need. One ticket is with Delta, so I would fly from my home airport to Atlanta with a small layover in Atlanta and then into JFK. Later that same day about seven hours later, I have a flight scheduled with Royal Air Maroc. Being that it's a international trip and a completely different airline with no connecting ticket, do I actually need to go outside the airport again and go back through TSA or can I just change terminals and check in at the RAM desk and give them my luggage? I really don't know what to do and want to make sure everything I do is correct.",solotravel,MagicalGirlUsagi

ANNOUNCEMENT: Upcoming AMA with Kyra from the No Country for Moving Podcast on SEPT. 23,"Hello everyone! We are very excited to host solo-traveling badass Kyra for an AMA on Wednesday, **September 23** (an earlier version of this had the wrong month, sorry!). Please see her introduction below:

&gt; Hello r/solotravel! 

&gt; My name is Kyra, and I'm the 34 year old SOLO BLACK FEMALE traveler, who calls Brooklyn her home. Although these days, most of my travel has been stateside, I always aim to take a good walking tour along with a deep dive of the history of every space, city and locale that I frequent. I'm a passionate urbanist who enjoys creating spaces in the arts and culture with a social justice framework and through the elevation of unheard voices of marginalized communities.

&gt; Case in point, I started a podcast called **@nocountryformoving**. On my podcast, I interview immigrants and migrants from across the globe about their story, political and socio-cultural differences between their native country and their host country, and even what it's like to date outside of their culture! 

&gt; What is driving this AMA is that I have been traveling solo since I was 20. First to my parent's motherland of Ghana, and then to countries such as Morocco, Argentina, Spain, Colombia, Ecuador, India, and the list continues! Each time I have traveled solo, I received similar responses from friends and family, "" Are you traveling with friends? Why not choose another country to go to? Are you sure that is a good idea? And each time my response was adamant, ""I'm going and I will be safe."" Of course, sometimes I wasn't that safe or made the best decisions, but I learned from them, and one thing that I was very sure about was that I needed to share my story and experiences with whomever I could so I could become a resource to the community as well. As a single Black woman, there have been a lot of insurmountable obstacles that I have faced that should be shared and learned from and I'm ready and willing to do that with you!

&gt; My travel timeline for reference:

&gt; * May-July 2008 - Ghana
&gt; * April - August 2010- India
&gt; * September 2010- July 2013 - Madrid, Spain
&gt; * July 2013 - August 2016 - Buenos Aires, Argentina
&gt; * Patagonia, Colombia, Ecuador April - October 2016


&gt; Highlights from the Kyra Tour

&gt; * Running with the bulls twice in Pamplona and only falling asleep once
&gt; * Getting lost in Las Fallas
&gt; * Being denied entry on the Moroccan and Spanish border
&gt; * Chamuyando (charming) my way back into Argentina after a return flight from America
&gt; * Getting trapped on the Ecuadorian and Colombian border
&gt; * Trapped in Buenos, Argentina due to a financial snafu
&gt; * Bloodwork debacles in the era of Zika
&gt; * Almost going to jail India
&gt; * Malaria in Ghana
&gt; * Falling in love in Buenos Aires/Patagonia
&gt; * Psychotic bosses in NYC

&gt; Join me for the AMA and follow up by listening to my podcasts @nocountryformoving on iTunes and Spotify and follow on IG @nocountryformoving and [Facebook] (https://www.facebook.com/groups/nocountryformoving) for stories of immigrants, travelers, and people like you. When you do watch an episode, please #nocountryformoving and reference the episode as well as @kymab on IG. 

&gt; Do not hesitate to ask me all of the questions, no matter how creepy or off-putting or uncomfortable. Since I'm gainfully fun-unemployed, I'm overeager to answer your questions. So get at me here, IG or Facebook.

&gt; PSA: I'm doing this AMA to dispel the myth that Black women do not travel and to  provide an entrance into a door of a Black female travel experience. **Representation matters!**

&gt; PSA2: I'm open to collaborations in the future around my podcast, so slide into my DMs or PMs.

&gt; Fun Fact: [this photo](https://imgur.com/a/tImKj6J) is my birthday weekend over a 10 ago prior to my bed bugs debacle in Essaouira, Morrocco.




We're going to start collecting questions now, so for anyone who's not sure they'll be able to make the AMA in real-time, please post your questions below and we'll move them over to the AMA on the day of.

In the meantime, you can check out Kyra's podcast [here] (https://anchor.fm/nocountryformoving)",solotravel,SoloTravelMods
Stuck between Santorini and Amalfi Coast?,"I’ve been given the chance to travel next week between the 22nd and 3rd for leisure and have the choice of Santorini and Amalfi. I’m struggling to choose as it seems windy this week in santorini, but I’m also not sure what there is to do in Amalfi for 10 days or if it’s worth going to a separate part of Italy half way. Does anyone have any advice?


If the weather improves would santorini still be warm in october? Or too windy/is 25mph winds the same as in England? Thanks",solotravel,aallillaa

"Bilbao, Spain --&gt; Rome, Italy in One Month","I'm planning a month long trip to Spain, France, and Italy for sometime in 2021, maybe? I'll be traveling with a Brompton folding-bike and traveling by bus and train. I have a first draft route made out to cover 30 days.

I did a month in Spain in 2018 and traveled the perimeter of the country clockwise beginning and ending in Bilbao. I also added Mallorca between Barcelona and Valencia. The trip was surprisingly easy  as far as logistics went, so now I'm eager to do it again and spend more time on the Mediterranean.

I'd like to hear about disc-golf courses, bike routes, day-trips to national parks, and roads-less-traveled. I'm 420 friendly and am not afraid to ask people where it's at, so any pointers on finding that  would be appreciated!

I'll edit this post as I plan the trip and add in people's suggestions. I hope to hear from you!

Schengen Zone for Dual Citizens,"I am an Australian looking to backpack across Europe for an extended period of time in a few years when hopefully Covid has settled down and air travel is back to normal. The time I want to stay there will exceed three months, which is the maximum amount of time allowed there without a visa. I happen to have a polish citizenship (also eligible for a spanish visa), does this exempt me from these restrictions travelling in the schengen zone due to being a citizen of the EU? Some clarity would be great, cheers.",solotravel,coynessisnice_
Moving abroad for work,"So I'm 25M Canadian, I've done a decent amount of traveling however I've always wanted to have the different experience of actually living in a new country as opposed to traveling in it. Maybe it's the pandemic and the thought that I won't be able to do any extensive traveling anytime soon, but it's really making me want to pull the trigger and just move to a new country and start working/living there for 1-2 years. That way I can still somewhat be ""traveling"" but while also living somewhere new.

My ideal choices are Ireland or New Zealand, and I'd prefer to work within my field (architecture/construction) but I wouldn't be opposed to working any odd job until I could find something else.

Can anyone share their experiences with moving to a new country for work? Did you have the job offer first before you moved? Or did you just take the plunge and move there without a job and then found one once you were there?",solotravel,nuggets95

Which countries in Europe are least restricted?,"Forgive me (British male) if this question is too vague, but where in Europe is most normal least restrictive to visit right now? I'd like to to a few places, for 2-3 weeks in total.  I'm mostly into galleries / museums / historical architecture over partying. 

 I was planning on booking flights less than a week in advance in case restrictions are added and  looking into Italy, Portugal, Scandanavia and a few places in the east of Europe, though I'd go anywhere that wasn't too heavily restricted. 

I'd honestly be happy constructing an itinerary based on each places covid restriction freeness, rather than picking places then researching their current restrictions.

Best Cities in Europe to Party? (20 Years Old),"My good friend and I are planning to spend roughly a month in Europe next summer, (this may end up happening in 2 summers due to COVID). But anyway, we're trying to figure out where to go. We are both 20, coming from Los Angeles. We went to London, Paris, and Amsterdam last summer and had a blast, but at most places, the crowds were a bit older than us, (which isn't surprising since we were 19 and 18).

Trying to find the best cities for nightlife and generally, younger nightlife, (our age). Our Current list of possible cities; Barcelona, Berlin, Prague, Budapest, Krakow, and Ibiza. What do you think of the list? Good, bad, or any better places out there? Thanks!

**Update:** Thank you everyone so much for all the recommendations! Our list as it stands: Berlin, Prague, Budapest, Barcelona, Magaluf, Krakow, Bratislava, Munich, Heidelberg, Bristol/Leads/Manchester, Lagos, Hvar, Split, Belgrade, Corfu, Mikonos Choro/Ios, Malia, Zakynthos, Ayia Napa, Hamburg, and Valencia.

We've decided we definitely want to visit Budapest, Prague, and Barcelona. Now we are just trying to narrow down other cities while we do some research! We've decided we'll probably spend somewhere between 4-6 weeks in Europe in July/August (hopefully if things are better), or if not, the following summer.

What To Pack For Hiking In The UK (Summer 2021),"So, as the title of my post states, I'm considering a solo hike somewhere in the UK (I'm from the UK already)(nothing set in stone yet, but I'm considering the South West Coast Path) during summer next year.

I'm really here just asking for advice, especially as an inexperienced hiker (also I'll be 20F). What sot of physical preparation should I put in beforehand? What sorts of things should I pack? What should I be looking for in a campsite (if I need one)? What should I be looking for in a hike in general?",solotravel,thesassypanda1731
How much money for trips?,"Hello! I’m over here daydreaming (and also planning) about multi-month travel trips. I’ve planned an Eastern Europe trip (Albania, Croatia, Greece, Slovenia, Slovakia, Macedonia, Hungary, Prague, Turkey, Poland, Ukraine) trip that would most likely last about 3-4 months. How much money would you advise having for that trip? I’d be being as frugal as possible, staying in hostels, only renting cars when necessary/taking public transpo, &amp; eating frugally when possible.

Same question for a Southeast Asia trip I have planned. (Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Singapore, Philippines, Bali, etc...) Would also be frugal and take public transport/stay in hostels.

I’ve done a few 3-4 month trips on 4-6K$ USD, but I’m unsure of how to gauge the price of these trips, as usually my trips have 1 or 2 main destinations and not upward of 10 or 15. I currently have 10K USD (a number that will hopefully increase as the travel ban continues), so would be looking at doing my first trip as soon as it’s over. 

Also, can anyone just give me general advice for being a solo female traveler in either of these areas!

What areas did you experience the most intense touts in your solo travels?,"This is just for fun. I know there are a lot, but the ones that immediately come to mind for me are:

In Indonesia, trying to sit on the beach in Legian. Touts trying to get you to by trinkets or give massages and manicures on the beach. Every two minutes someone would come by, not exaggerating. Definitely not a place to relax. Thank you for letting me know my nails look ugly and it’s why I don’t have a boyfriend. I got shamed so much I decided I probably did need to get one as soon as I leave the beach but I just don’t want to get a mani pedi on the sand.

In India, getting off the bus in Jaisalmer. Touts trying to get you to go with them on a camelback desert tour. All up in your face, yelling for your attention, no personal space at all. 

In Vietnam, getting of the bus in Saigon. So many people trying to get me to go with their tuk-tuk. One even said I was dropped on in zone 3 and too far away from zone 1, where all the hotels are. Luckily I saw the address on a store stating this was zone 1. Now that I think about it, this more of a scam not a tout.

Solo Dude Ranch/Guest Ranch trip?,"Just curious if anyone has ever been to a dude/guest ranch solo (more specifically the ones that are all-inclusive)? A few of them don’t even charge a single supplement, and some of them that do are a minimal cost. 

I love the idea of horseback riding all day, the communal meals, other activities such as archery and hiking, and maybe some time in a pool/hot tub or a massage (a little bit of luxury wouldn’t hurt, but it doesn’t have to be a luxury guest ranch by any stretch). 

I have been looking in Montana, Wyoming and Arizona, but I’d love to hear about any location. Obviously right now the wildfires and smoke are affecting the American West. I am curious what time of year you traveled as it seems this would largely affect the experience.

I miss my people. I miss solotravel.,"I need to get this off my chest.

Solotravel is the only time I get to feel truly 'connected'. The people I meet, whether its late night star gazing, watching the penguins come ashore at the beach, drinking to obliteration through the town, doing cartwheels off a dare, riding a sketchy bus together, or just walking around town it awe. Its discovering what 'in the moment' means. I miss solotraveling and making friends so much.  I miss that hostel life.

Theres something special that you 'let go' of when travelling abroad. You stop looking at people for their 'profession' and instead as a person. You dont have anywhere to go but here, so you take it all in. No distractions, no meetings, no texts, just living..being awake. 

I dont get that much here in the US. Im 31 now, and I have a decent job that pays me a silly amount of money. Ive once returned from my travels before and was unemployed, it was not fun and was a reality check on how difficult it is to land a decent job. No money = no travel. Right now, my plan is the grind it out a few years, invest money, and change careers to something where I can take more time off where I can not worry if I dont make much (or anything at all). I try not to have too much material attachments just in case i decide to say 'fuck it'. 

 This is just me ranting, wondering how my other fellow travelers are. Sending out love and reminding myself that I am not alone. I will see you guys out there again. Well party it up, ride scooters in flip flops, and have conversations about the most random to deepest bs ever. 

Its tough right now, on everyone. I love and miss my friends both made and soon to make. Please folks, be safe and keep your head up. Ill see you guys soon.",solotravel,LegSnapper206

"Eureka Springs, AR, or Branson, MO?","Hi.  Basically haven't left my house for six months.  Been taking quarantine very seriously.  Looks like I'll have to do some travel on family business.  No way am I flying.  So it's a road trip.   Branson and Eureka Springs are at about my halfway point for this drive.  Gonna grab a motel out that way.  As long as I'm out there, I'll poke around and see what I can see.  Masked up and distant of course, and nowhere near restaurants or bars.   Just wandering the towns for a bit in the late afternoon / evening and then maybe a bit the next morning.

Looked on the web a bit for things going on there and have an idea what's available, but would like an insider / indie / solo traveler view.  I like quality museums, good restaurants, and brewpubs, but those are off the list unless they have food/drink to go.  Maybe looking for interesting scenery / outdoor spaces, funny roadside insanity, maybe some walking trails, history sites, and as little consumerist/corporate culture as possible (leaning away from Branson for that reason).  Given those criteria... someone talk me into or out of one town or the other. 

This might be only glimpse of the world for *another* six months (and given these two options, that's kinda pathetic!), so I want to choose wisely.",solotravel,fevertronic

I've had my share of experiences traveling and I miss it immensely, this is not only due to the worldwide circumstances with the Covid pandemic and the measures governments are taking to prevent the spread. My last ""real"" solo journey was two and a half years ago when I went to The Gambia for three months (as part of an internship)

I got to meet and work with wonderful people that I miss dearly, a colorful culture, beautiful nature and even wild parties at the Senegambia beach clubs. Experiences for which I will remain eternally grateful.

After returning to my country, I haven't really felt home anymore, my heart lies with Mama Africa. The reason for my title though is that I can't share this feeling with anyone back here. No one was there and while they are fully supportive of my dreams to go back, the feeling that happiness is only real when shared is starting to loom on me.

Sure I make friends as I go along and we make memories, but when traveling solo, you don't stay in touch with everyone. Experiences are fleeting and while that makes it beautiful, it also hints at the tragedy of the ever devouring nature of time and getting older.

So my question is really for those that made the move leaving their home country, family and friends for a lifetime of travel. How do you look back at it and how do you feel about what the title suggests?

I also wouldn't mind hearing stories of solo travelers who ""found their pack"" or ""found new roots"" to cheer my too-young-to-be-nostalgic ass up

Thanks!",solotravel,goldenradiovoice420

How to Reignite the Spark of Doing Trips/Activities Solo,"Hey all; I'm in need of some advice from this wonderful community on something that's not *strictly* about solo travel (although definitely is a part of it!) but also about doing more general activities alone, so I hope it's okay to post this!

I've always been happy to do things solo; be it a city break, going to a gig or just taking in a museum and all that good stuff, mainly for the usual reasons; being single, unreliable friends, just feeling spontaneous etc.  However, I've recently noticed I've been more reluctant to do these activities myself. For example, I'm off work next week and I know this time last year I'd have considered and done all sorts of things to fill my time; a city break in Europe, have a trip round the zoo, see some of the sights I haven't seen in London yet. I'm finding it really hard to get motivated to do these similar sort of things this year though. Obviously COVID comes into play, but I was mulling over a little day trip to the coast as it's meant to be a scorcher next week, but I'm just struggling to find the will to do it on my own. 

I feel like I'm experiencing a bit of solo burnout or rut. I do so much on my own and have many great experiences that I would  never have had if I didn't take the plunge to do things myself, but part of me is thinking when planning of things to do in my head ""I wish I could share this experience with others"". It's wearing me down a bit and making me feel quite hard on myself because as it stands, next week I'll just be sitting on the sofa all week. It's even little things like going to the local coffee shop on my own I'm feeling resistance towards.

Has anyone else ever felt like this? Is there tips anyone can give of how to get out of this mental roadblock I've set myself for some reason? It just seems very weird; obviously with the exception of COVID my personal circumstances hasn't really changed in the past year that would make me flip from preferring to do things solo to the opposite.

 Any advice/tips/stories would be hugely appreciated!",solotravel,JHutch95

Anyone have any cool Covid travel stories?,"Id like to hear some cool solo travel stories that anyone has had during Covid. Heres mine.

Back in early December I left the U.S. for a 3 month journey to Georgia ( the country) . My plan was to head to Istanbul for 10 days on my way back to the U.S. By the time i left Georgia on March 3rd, Covid was already buzzing about on the news. 

After a few days in Istanbul, countries started announcing the closure of borders and airports. I had to make a decision on whether i would leave early and head back before Turkey shut down or just ride it out. I have a small lawn care business in Montana I run by myself so had to figure out if it was worth going back. I decided to put my business on hold and stay. 

I booked a room for 2 months in a massive 4 bedroom apartment next to Galata Tower. Luckily for me the owners were stuck in another part of Turkey and by this point all international and domestic flights were grounded. I had  the entire apartment to myself for 2 months. I met some other people living in the apartment complex who were throwing lovely hard techno raves on the rooftop complete with lights, smoke machines and other party treats every weekend. 

At the end of April i met an amazing Turkish girl and we ended up falling in love. It was my first time in Istanbul so we explored the city and I was able to see Istanbul in a way that people had never seen before. Normally bustling streets were empty, tourist destinations desolate of humans but filled with the famous streets cats. 

In July, 1 month past my visa expire date, flights started resuming. The only country accepting people flying from Turkey was Serbia so i decided to head there for a week to reapply for my tourist visa. Despite the U.S. embassy saying i wouldnt be penalized for overstaying my visa, i still had troubles getting back in. After 3 hours of talking with multiple police and walking all over the new and massive Istanbul Airport i was finally able to enter. The catch, I had 10 days to apply for temp residency. 

Now, 6 months from when i first arrived in Turkey, im still here. My girlfriend and i have just moved into our first apartment. I wont be heading back to the U.S. until March or April of next year. I know Covid has caused all sorts of mess in the world but for me its been a real treat.",solotravel,robwander3031

I need to escape winter in Britain for health reasons,"I have various health problems which are hugely exacerbated by the cold damp winters we get in Britain, and are helped by being somewhere really hot. 

I've seen some huge improvements in my health in recent years because I've spent a month in South India the last two winters (including being quarantined in Goa but that's another story)

So I need to somehow escape the winter too somewhere close to the equator that's not too expensive. It would be nice if it's by the sea and not too risky in terms of horrific diseases, but other than that I'm very open to ideas where, if anywhere, I'm likely to be allowed to visit.

Need suggestions on what to do in Canada in december.,"Hi guys,

Long time lurker and first time poster. So I just recently moved to Canada from the UK and I'm currently based in Toronto. My workplace forced us to pick dates for our annual leave back in April and I randomly picked 2 weeks off from Dec 7th to 18th hoping the travel restrictions might have eased off by then and I can travel out of Canada to go somewhere warm. Unfortunately doesn't seem like it and now I have 2 weeks off so was hoping if anyone here have any suggestions where I can go within Canada? 

I can't ski/snowboard :( is the west coast still worth doing if I don't participate in those activities?

I was also thinking I might go try dog sledding or go aurora watching then. But I feel even those activities aren't ideal in December when it's not quite peak snow season. 
I might try learning skiing again if there's really no better suggestion. Go for lessons for a couple of days and spend the rest of the days chilling out on the west coast.

I've tried changing my leave dates but management isn't budging (plus I can't bring any leave forward to use in 2021). I'll also be traveling solo if that matters? 

Any suggestions will be appreciated!!",solotravel,choki-choki

Trip Report 2020 (from America): Cozumel Aug 1-30,"Solo travel, 33M, scuba diver, working part time 

**The flight:** 

There are no direct flights from any of the bay area airports to Cozumel. There were some that flew to Cancun, but then to get to Cozumel would require a \~1 hour taxi plus \~1 hour ferry ride. I decided on AA because they fly straight into Cozumel from Dallas. I flew out of SFO. The flights between Dallas and San Francisco were around half full both ways. Excellent. The flights between Dallas and Cozumel were fully booked both ways. Unfortunately, AA does not block middle seats. People were generally good about wearing masks. You’re allowed to take it off to eat or drink but you have to put it back on when you’re done. AA did a good job of personally reminding people to put their masks back on during the flight. 

**The trip:** 

This was my third time in Coz. Compared to the last two times, it felt like a ghost town. More than half the shops downtown weren’t open. Bars/restaurants weren’t blasting music – an improvement, IMO. There was a curfew at around 10 pm every night. 

Diving was spectacular. I did 20 dives in Cozumel and 4 dives in the Cenotes on the mainland, between Playa del Carmen and Tulum. If you get a chance to dive the Cenotes, YOU MUST DO IT. It’s so different from diving in the ocean. The coral in Cozumel looked very healthy, likely because there's much so much less activity from divers and the large cruise ships that dock in Cozumel. 

Also did a weekend trip to Isla Mujeres to swim with the whale sharks! It's whale shark season and they are migrating south. The trip isn't cheap, especially from Cozumel. I had to stay overnight in Playa del Carmen because the trips leave from Playa early morning. It was worth to swim with the whale sharks, but I wouldn't do it again.

Some of my favorite restaurants: 

1. Crazy King Burrito for their shrimp burritos  
2. Jeanies (good wifi, good place to watch the sunset, prices are reasonable for a touristy restaurant on the water) 
3. Coconuts (schill beach bar/restaurant) 
4. MEGA grocery store for their ceviche. 

**The social scene:** 

I was working half time and did not have time to put a lot of effort into meeting new people. My days mostly consisted of early morning dives, get back to the hotel around noon, shower, and hop online by 12:30 (10:30 am in pacific time) and worked until 6pm or so with plenty of breaks in between. 

One of the reasons I love diving is because you can meet people fellow divers from all over the world. At minimum, there is always a German on the boat. Love the Germans. That wasn't the case this time. Everyone was from America, which is fine. I grabbed lunch/drinks a few times with fellow divers. Most of the tourists I saw were age 50 and up. There weren’t a lot of ways to meet people organically.

**Safety Precautions:** 

\-	I had my temperature taken and was given hand sanitizer at the entrance of every grocery store, mall, dive shop, ferry boat entrance, and most restaurants. The larger the operation, the more likely this happened. I did not have my temperature taken at the mom-and-pop type places.  

\-	The locals were good about wearing masks, especially in the touristy areas. It was clear that the locals were doing what they could to make visitors feel safe, considering that the island relies almost ENTIRELY on tourism. I stayed mostly in touristy areas. Probably 90% of the locals I saw wore masks. There was a noticeable decline in safety precautions when I went to the super local areas. Unfortunately, the tourists were less great about wearing masks. I would estimate mask adherence to be around 70%. Truly unfortunate. It makes me embarrassed to be an American. 

\-	There are rules capping capacity at restaurants, hotels, and other “activities” like scuba diving. None of the places I visited was anywhere near full capacity. Now, whether that’s because everyone follows the rules in Mexico or because there just simply weren’t many tourists is not a judgement I’ll make. 

\-	I was not required to show a negative COVID test. Nor was there any mandatory quarantine. States in Mexico are implementing their own rules, so check before you travel. 

**Costs:** 

\- Each dive (including equipment rental) was around 40 USD.

\-Meals:  I avoid the touristy restaurants when I can. Cost of an entree at a casual touristy place was around 10 USD. Obviously it can cost much more than that if you are looking for a fancy place. Cost of 3 tacos in a taco stand is around 3 USD. 

\-Hotels and flight were mostly book on points. My 2-3 star hotel was around 44 USD per night. 

\-Car rental was around 35 USD per day. 

\-Isla Mujeres whale shark trip was 200 USD. 

**To my fellow divers** – the Cozumel forum on Scubaboard is pretty active and a great places to get dive-specific info.  

**To fellow travelers who plan on going to Cozumel** – the rules are constantly changing, so check before you go. The facebook group Cozumel4You was a great resource. Be safe, be responsible. 

**To those who think I should “stay the fuck home”** – stay the fuck home and keep these beautiful places uncrowded for the rest of us.

vintage solo trip report: driving the US I-5 &amp; 101 west coast,"This happened years ago, but I want to send out encouragement to US-restricted solo travelers: it's possible to have amazing experiences, you can do it.


I had a month of free time between jobs, and my level of budget/adventure at the time was a solo road trip in my mid-90s Honda. I'm based in Oregon, so my first stop was at my grandma's house in southern Oregon. I stayed for a few days and we had a great time. Attractions in this area include Crater Lake national park, the Rogue river, and a wildlife park that advertises the most successful cheetah breeding program in America.


I drove south on I-5 (Mt Shasta yas!) and met a friend in Stockton who guided me through winding mountain roads in the dark to an amazing house owned by his relatives in the Sierra Nevada, where we met up with other friends and spent the weekend wine tasting and hanging out. I woke up early and wandered out to the deck, where I was surrounded by hummingbirds. Highlights of this area include Calaveras Big Trees state park and Bear Valley ski resort, neither of which I visited.


On to L.A. for the next few days! I drove the I-5 over the Grapevine and couchsurfed with friends. Venice Beach and Santa Monica!! Had dessert and walked on the beach. I left my wallet in El Segundo at a coffee shop, but I got got got got it back (thx to the coffee shop staff!).


I drove north on the 101 from Malibu to San Francisco, where I stayed with a family friend for a few days. We watched TV, shopped and had a great time together. S.F. is a wonderful place to visit. I explored Amoeba Music, the Haight-Ashbury district, Golden Gate park...!


From S.F., I continued driving N on Hwy 101, through agricultural communities in northern CA and southern OR, it was gorgeous and slow and the coastal views were amazing. Highly recommended.",solotravel,charmparticle
A covid-fun trip report flying to Taiwan,"So seven days ago, I moved to Taiwan for a year to work and hide from covid. This was not a holiday but a one way flight and trip to stay here until my contract is up. Below is a lengthy summary of how I got to one of the safest covid countries in the world and enduring one of the strictest quarantines:

I was staying in New York with my family for six months, experiencing the horrors of what once was the epicentre of the pandemic. My trip to Taiwan began by securing an N95 and a surgical mask to my face, along with goggles - a set up that would stay on my face for 24 hours, during one Uber, one airplane, two airports, and one taxi to my quarantine in Taiwan. JFK's Terminal 1 was like a ghost town. The only flight leaving that night was to Taipei.

Previous flights to Taiwan were practically empty (25% capacity), my flight was 60/70% full with a few middle seats left empty. 16 hours was a long time in the air and I was paranoid about removing my mask so I only removed it to drink water and eat. Luckily, I was served a special meal that allowed me to eat 30 mins before everyone else took off their masks.

I arrived dreary-eyed at Taipei Taoyuan International Airport. Two lines formed as we touched down: one with people who did not own Taiwanese sim cards and those who did. We were required to purchase government tracked sim cards for 30 days. After passing through immigration and picking up my suitcases, I was zipped down to my quarantine hotel in the centre of Taipei.

My room came with 48 bottles of water, four boxes of tissues, alcohol santizer, washing powder, sheets, and three meals a day. I have to stay inside for 15 days in this room. I receive daily texts from the government confirming if I have symptoms or not. Calls from government employees every four days. Fines from 1000 to 10,000 USD if I leave the room.

I've got five days left and will be promptly leaving this room one minute past Friday midnight to a bar to drink and celebrate my end of quarantine.",solotravel,xianggangren

Planning a RTW Trip for 2021. Is this manageable? Looking for suggestions/recommendations.,"Hi All,

Firstly, thank you for this community, I've learnt a lot from the posts here and helped me plan this trip too. This will be my second solo trip, first one being in Central Europe. I'm looking to understand if this trip is feasible and what changes would you recommend.

Interests:  Adventurous activities (bungee jumping, kayaking, and anything that will involve ""doing"" something. Also enjoy good sights and natural beauty (small hikes but nothing crazy). I (25M) do enjoy partying, so hoping by next summer I can have good social experiences at hostels. I also would like to have a few days for down days where I don't want to do much. Going to have some in Portugal but looking for suggestions of where I can have those later in the trip as well. Also interested in trying out different foods in these countries.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think I need to add/cut? I do think Japan could have more time but I will probably do a second trip during Cherry Blossom season so will try to cover more then.

I'm actually quite worried, that it'll either be really expensive, or a lot of hostels, small restaurants, etc will be shut down.

25M: New years in Turkey; any recommendations for where the best celebrations are?,"So I'll be in Turkey for the 1st time for 2 weeks around new years. I was personally looking to be in Istanbul at 31st, after spending some time in Antalya. 

I saw some posts regarding other more interesting, less crowded tourist trap cities and now reconsidering them in favor of cities that are more fun. Also considering how cheap domestic flights are, I'm even more inclined. 

Any recommendations about cities are welcome. 

Furthermore, my I'm planning on using Airbnb for accommodations, in case it's possible to have more fun for less money (hostels?). Or any other way I can utilize my budget ($500-$600 for 10 days) more efficiently.

Leap of Faith (in Myself),"With everything going on in the world I've decided to jump into uncertainty. I've solo traveled in the past but never without a solid plan. Inflexible dates, obligations, and expectations have stunted my growth and sense of wonder as well as my faith in myself. I always return to a job I hate in the same city I was born in. 

I need to realize that life continues whether plans work out or not. I need to take a leap and trust that I'll be ok. I'm smart, resourceful, and open to new experiences and opportunities. I'll never truly be alone or without help if I really need it, as my friends and family are always there to lend a hand. They know that I am responsible and worthy of trust. 

With the pandemic still in full swing, my U.S passport is more or less worthless so I've decided to explore my own backyard so to speak, and road trip the lower 48 with the money I have saved. I'll be doing various workaways, both paid and unpaid, sharing my skills and learning new ones. I'm looking forward to making new connections and experiencing different ways of life. 

I've arranged for someone to take over my lease, downsized my belongings, and invested in essentials for car camping and sustainable travel. I quit my job and told my family and friends that I'm leaving the city. 

With no clear end, this is not a conventional approach. I am afraid of so many aspects of this journey; interpersonal interactions, providing inadequate help, running out of money, car trouble, being underprepared, etc. and those around me are just as apprehensive, but we all have an understanding that this is a journey I need to take. I need to grow and prove to myself that I can live and enjoy life.

I need to learn to trust myself.

I'm starting out with a mini-adventure to test the waters. The month of November and potentially half of December will be spent doing workaways on the east coast. Then I'll be returning home for the holidays and heading out west for longer-term opportunities. Wish me luck y'all.",solotravel,cjwellz13

My ex grew up in a ridiculously small village (it doesn't even have a pub!) in Devon, but somehow halfway round the world I still ended up sharing a bunk in a four bed dorm room in Surfer's Paradise with someone who worked in the garage there.

How do I come out my shell more when solo travelling?,"Hi all,
            I think I need a little encouragement. I'm 28M from the UK. I started solo travelling when I was 25 and done 7/8 trips alone so far. 

However I find for some reason I really go into my shell when abroad alone instead of coming out my shell (god knows why). So I've never really interacted properly with anyone or met new friends on these countless trips and always come home kicking myself feeling like I've missed an opportunity. I feel I miss out on experiences as well as part of this. 

The thing is, back home I'm a really social and laid back guy. So I'm not sure why I can't translate this into the way I act when I'm abroad. Its like I get social anxiety only when abroad. 

I'm headed to Germany in a few days and really want to throw myself in the deep end. I'm considering a hostel dorm but still apprehensive (silly I know). I also want to push myself to meet people. 

It's most likely been covered before but how has solo travel helped you come out your shell and is there any tips you can give me for basically overcoming social anxiety and meeting people and experiencing amazing things while solo travelling. 

Thanks.",solotravel,Dr_Nuggets_

I'm thinking of planning a trip to India in the near-ish future (post the rona anyway, so not that soon). I thought it might be interesting to do some of the trip by cargo ship.

"A few solo days in Colorado, what towns have epic scenery and fun social aspect?","I'll be in Colorado soon meeting some friends at the front end of the trip. We will hit some of the major parks. At the tail end of my trip I am doing some work in Denver. In between I have a few days on my own and I want to visit a great place to hike and meet people. I would greatly appreciate your advice! I'm trying to tick two boxes here:

1 - epic scenery during day hikes

2 - great place to chill, eat great food, and socialize with new people in the afternoon/evening. leaning towards places that have youngish crowds 20s-30s

The first one has been easy, no shortage of sites and recommendations online. But the second I just don't know about and having a harder time getting clarity on. Vail, Telluride, Aspen, Colorado Springs...any of these fit the bill? Or other recommendations?

Edit: thanks for the suggestions. These are great. 

To address the comment about pandemic, I get that concern. I’m not looking for parties and big crowds. That’s part of the reason I skipped Labor Day weekend. Trying to keep it laid back and just looking for a town that doesn’t shut down quickly in the evening (had that experience in Durango). I want to be able to still stay engaged with the local scene, try local restaurants, perhaps a brewery, etc.

I’ve stayed quarantined since March and was the first one to encourage work from home in March to my team before it became common. I wear a mask everywhere if I have to leave the house for groceries and essentials and will continue to practice safety. I even got tested just last week to be certain I’m not an asymptomatic carrier. I was  hesitant to travel but i am trying to stay responsible and enjoy myself too.

Thanks again for the suggestions it’s much appreciated. Looking forward to exploring your amazing state.",solotravel,loopernova
Affordable options for accommodation to break up a long road trip (USA),"I’ve been really enjoying wandering around the region but the cost of motels and Airbnb’s at nightly rates is really starting to become an issue. I also think staying a week or more in the same place makes for a better experience in principle, without having to sublet an apartment or give up too much freedom (I guess I’m on the road “till covid is over” and who knows what that means at this point!)

I’ve explored Airbnb (including their new “longer stays” option which is monthly), VRBO, Hipcamp, and hostels (many with dorm beds are closed). I don’t know how Craigslist is these days, but if there are any similar options that have a bit more of a security net in terms of vetting hosts or having someone to turn to if things go wrong.

Occasionally there are roadside motels that turn out to have a much cheaper weekly rate but it’s really hard to find out about those type of things if you haven’t already wound up staying there for a few nights by chance.

Ideally the island won't be too busy, definitely not a party island.

Traveling solo for first time to Crete,"Hi everyone, I will be traveling in about 13 days for about 2 weeks to Crete (May stay longer but not sure yet) I have a full time job and I have a week and half off, and my boss told me I can work remote there if I wish. My questions are, what do you suggest for Crete ? I know I will go on some boat trips and elafonisi, the gorges, kayaking, paddle boarding, maybe balos lagoon, snorkeling, fishing. I will be staying in chanios. 

I’m trying to figure out if I should rent a car or not, one air bnb host told me the buses are running at lower frequency cuz of corona?

I’m also wondering how expensive water sports and such are ? Decently cheap that I can run off for the day and not pay too much ? 

I’m also a little worried I may not be able to go if cases increase in the next 2 weeks?

Is WiFi good there ?

Older travellers staying in Dorms.,"Hi all, i hope this post finds you all well.

I'm heading out on the road for a year long trip across europe to asia sometime next year and whilst i don't want to plan too much i do like to have an idea of the route i'll take and in particular how much the trip is going to cost me.

So part of the number crunching involves working out accommodation costs and it looks like this will be the major cost of my trip until i hit central asia and beyond.....unless i stay in dorms which would bring costs down considerably.

Thing is i have never stayed in a dorm....i've travelled to over 100 countries and consider myself well travelled but aside from the last year all my trips have been with the ex-wife and now i'm venturing out on my own and i can't wait.....but dorms??!!

So whats the opinion of dorms for the slightly more mature posters here?...do you still stay in them? whats the reception like for an older guy (mid-50's) staying in a dorm?

&amp;#x200B;

I wouldn't be staying in dorms exclusively but it makes sense if i'm passing through for just a couple of days to keep the costs down....i'm ok with it but i have a mortal dread of rocking up at a hostal and its party-central with late-teen,early 20's crowd....i would hate that. I'm not a prude but i wouldn't now want to hang around with my 20 year old former self.

For me, it was while waiting at the main bus terminal in Malacca, Malaysia for a bus to the airport. It was around midnight and the indoor area was closed so I had to wait outside. Luckily it wasn't cold, because Malaysia, but it still wasn't the most comfortable experience having to wait outside for 2+ hours in the middle of the night. There wasn't a lot of people there and I was probably the only foreigner. Of the people present, there were two teenage boys waiting nearby. After some time, they went to the convenience store and then approached me offering a water bottle. We didn't speak much but I remember feeling so touched by their random kindness.

Tips on traveling through Nordic Europe?,"Like many other people, covid has made me really tired of my surroundings and I really want to have an experience in a place that’s very different from where I’m currently stuck. I (18f) am planning on doing a solo trip to the Faroe islands, Norway and Sweden. This is going to be my first solo trip but I’ve done a fair bit of international travel with family before, so I feel quite experienced. I’ve made a tentative itinerary for 30-40 days during May or June, either in 2021 or 2022, whichever covid allows. 

A few things:

* Due to my age and relative driving inexperience, I am not going to rent a car. I understand that this is particularly difficult to do in the Faroe islands, so I plan to go with a tour for the most part. 
* I’m not a partier or avid drinker and much prefer to see nature or experience the culture of each city.
* Since I’m also going to be a full time student, traveling during the spring and summer is my only option if i want to go for an extended period of time for the next 4 years.
* I’ve spent the last 3 years working so i’m prepared to spend around $7000 - $8000 Canadian for hostels, flights, entertainment, food, and transport
* I don’t have a desire to go out to many restaurants, bars, etc and want to buy most of my food from local grocery stores.
* I love nature, but I’m not an experienced hiker, camper or skier. I mostly want to do moderate hikes, kayak, see museums, local concerts, etc.

My itinerary is as follows:

**Tromso** (4 days)

Fly to **Trondheim** (4 days)

Fly to **Bergen** (4 days)

Bus or ferry to **Flam** and explore neighbouring fjords (7 days)

Train to **Oslo** (4 days)

Train to **Goteburg** (4 days)

Train to **Stockholm** (5 days)

Plane to **Faroe islands** (7 days)

Specific questions:

Is it worth it to visit Tromso even if I won’t be able to see the northern lights due to the time of year of my visit? Then I would visit more of western Norway instead, like Alesund. 

Is this doable on my budget, what unexpected expenses should I account for?

How reliable is the public transport?

Any must visit places that I haven’t included or any specific places I should avoid?

Is it difficult being a non native speaker while traveling there?

Only problem is if I hear someone say something like ""Oh I'm going on a trip to Saint Lucia"", in my mind I always picture either a cruise ship or some sort of luxury resort, which really isn't in my price range.

Has anyone here solo budget traveled to the Caribbean? I know that plane tickets are cheap, but I've never heard anyone talk about Caribbean hostels or budget hotels, or things to do on the island that don't involve some sort of cruise or resort excursion.

"Looking for a drivable location from Milwaukee, WI","Need help picking a location to travel to.

I need to get away, had plans for other travel cancelled because of COVID, but now I’m really itching to escape for a while. I have recently gone through a divorce and now that it is finalized, I want to go somewhere to clear my head and escape from work for a long weekend/week.

During the divorce, after we separated, I really gained a new interest in the outdoors, National Parks, just the natural beauty that is out there. I would love to go out west, and have not ruled that out, but as a solo travel on a shortened time frame, I would like to see what options I have, maybe some hidden gems that I may not find on my own. Flying/renting a car isn’t out of the question either, if the price is right.

I initially thought of flying to Banff National Park, but with the US/Canada border closed that isn’t possible. Next, I considered driving to Utah and hitting those National Parks, but after mapping that out, I realized that was a 54 hr round trip of driving and would not fit my schedule of a max length of 1 week trip. Have also considered the Black Hills and North Carolina.

Realistically, I am looking to travel in October. Thanks in advance!",solotravel,deezy2190
Possible to survive on 20k~35k a year in SE Asia?,"Obviously not for now but just doing research for the future. My income from stock trading per year ranges around $15-$20,000 (pre-tax - i can usually get the tax rate down doing long term trades). I wanted to travel around 1-2 years mostly in SE asia in the future while working partially, digital nomad style.

My income right now is around 125k a year in Los Angeles so it's definitely going to be an adjustment, but definitely would sacrifice it for a year or two of traveling and doing what I love the most. I have enough savings so I can dip into 10-15k a year on top of my  trading income (so my annual spending could hit 35k pretty comfortably, but would like to not touch it much as possible). I also think I can probably make 10-15k a year if I was to work part time since my hourly rate is around 70 dollars freelancing online. I might also go for my dive master certification and start working part time doing that too (annual income is around $10-15k in se asia per year). Does this seem doable?

"Montreux - what to see, top attractions","Swiss Riviera on the shores of Lake Geneva - Montreux! Why you need to go there, what to see and where to go in Montreux and the surrounding area, as well as how to get there and where to live.

The pandemic disrupted my travel plans a little, but the whole rhythm of life. And that was a big blow to me. During 2019 - early 2020, I traveled almost non-stop, making only rare stops in Kiev (I'm from Ukraine).

One of the most striking travels is the Swiss Alps, Lake Geneva and the part of France that borders Switzerland. Today I will tell you about Montreux, a trip to this city was largely due to my local friends. Thank you guys!

# The main attractions of Montreux

Montreux is a very small city and I cannot say that it has the beauty that we are used to seeing in ancient European cities. Montreux is more modern than historical. Usually my main criterion for evaluating a city is whether I want to return? So you want to come back to Montreux again and again, or even better - stay here for a while.

If time is short, just walk along Lake Geneva, this will be enough to fall in love with Montreux. You can heighten your senses by looking at the city and the surrounding Alps from the water with a glass of champagne or local dry white.

The main thing in Montreux is the views of Lake Geneva and its surroundings and stories associated with famous people who have visited the city at different times - from royalty, musicians and actors to famous prisoners.

# Chateau Chillon fortress

A 13th century fortress that stands on a small island in Lake Geneva, but actually on the shore. Undoubtedly, Chillon Castle is the main architectural attraction of Montreux.

It is best to look at the fortress from the water.

The main function of the castle of the fortress in antiquity was the family estate of the Counts of Savoy in the Middle Ages. The second function is a prison where many famous prisoners were kept.

***Location****: Avenue de Chillon 21, Veitaud / Montreux, Switzerland, just a few minutes drive from the city center, I walked pretty quickly.*

# Jazz Festival in Montreux

The world's number one landmark event. Somewhere it is abruptly even the Olympic Games in sports. I was both lucky and unlucky at the same time - I got to Montreux on the eve of the festival, literally a week before the start and saw all the preparations and the beginning ""movement"", but the travel schedule did not allow me to stay.

The festival was called jazz in its origin - it was conceived as jazz. But after 1970, such luminaries of the rock scene as Queen, Frank Zappa, Deer Purple were its active participants.

Remember the famous Smoke on the water Deep Purple? The song was written in memory of the event when the casino burned down in Montreux in 1971 just during the performance of Frank Zappa. Thick white smoke drifted over Lake Geneva, which inspired Gillan to write this song.

Miles Davis, Nina Simone and Ella Fitzgerald have performed at the festival at various times; after the 1970s, non-jazz artists such as Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, BB King, Oscar Peterson and others participated in it.

The festival can also be viewed free of charge from a boat or boat on Lake Geneva.

***Location****: Avenue Claude Nobs 5, Montreux, Switzerland, right on the shores of Lake Geneva.*

# City promenade in Montreux

The promenade is a 3.5 km long pedestrian road. from the Château de Chillon to Clarence. There are many flowers along the promenade, so the best time to walk is in spring. Each view from the boardwalk is a postcard, especially in calm weather, when the reflections of the castle and mountain peaks are especially beautiful.

***Location****: Along Lake Geneva, Montreux, Switzerland*

# Queen studio

In Montreux, the studio of the Queen group was located - Montreux Mountain, 7 albums of the group were recorded here. After Freddie's death, a sculpture of a musician was installed on the Montreux quay.

***Location****: Casino Barrièrede Montreux, RueduTheatre 9, Montreux, Switzerland*

# Gorge du Chauderon

In the old town is the beginning of the hiking trail along the gorge du Chauderon. The gorge is carved by the river La Baye-de-Montreux, which flows into Lake Geneva. The trail leading to and from Montreux is clearly marked.

***Location****: Old Town, Montreux, Switzerland*

# Lamp trail Les Pléiades

A non-trail path in Les Pléiades, which is called a lamppost for the fact that there are lanterns along it that illuminate the path.

The Lantern Trail is the main winter attraction in Montreux. I knew about her, so I included this attraction in the list.

It is better to walk along the lamppost path in winter, when the light of the lanterns is reflected in the snowdrifts, giving it a slight mysticism.

***How to get there****: To get on the trail you need to take the train from Montreux train station to Les Pléiades station. We leave and follow the signs along the trail illuminated by lanterns. Better to rent snowshoes. End your walk with a Swiss fondue tasting at Les Pléiades.*

***Address****: Les Pléiades, Montreux, Switzerland*

# Lavaux Vineyard Terraces

Lavaux vineyards are included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Tourists love them not for the lists, but for the panoramic views along the path and for the wine cellars where you can taste everything that is produced from local grapes.

Do you know why Swiss wine is not sold in your country? Because the Swiss drink almost everything they produce. So say the Swiss themselves, if anything. But at home, in Kiev, I did not see a lot of Swiss wine.

The Lavaux vineyards are 830 hectares between Lausanne and Montreux. Most use the Lavaux Express or Lavaux Panoramic special trains. But it is better to walk along the trails along the vineyards.

***Location****: Lavaux Vineyard Terraces, Puidu, Switzerland*

# Daffodil trail

This attraction is also in our bookmarks if we get to Montreux in the spring. There are many flower trails in the surrounding mountains. The tourist office of the city has maps with marked trails, or use any cartographic service - there are routes there too.

# Walk on Lake Geneva

I left this activity for dessert. The views from Lake Geneva are not at all like what we see from the shore. It is ideal to combine both walks, water and walking. Be sure to take a boat trip to the Lake Geneva Conservation Area - there is a lot of wildlife, birds and aquatic life.

On Lake Geneva, you can rent any small boat - from a water catamaran or canoe to a boat. You can take a ticket for a pleasure boat, but the privacy of the moment is violated, you will have to ride with a crowd of tourists.

**I was lucky** \- I admired Montreux on a private motor boat.

# Conclusion

Montreux definitely has a lot to see and have fun for the solo tourist. If you are from Europe, especially Eastern Europe, I strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself in your free time.

This is my first such major post, I will be glad to hear your criticism and suggestions. Thanks for your attention!

***Pleasant journey, friends.***

# P.S. A few words about travel insurance

You do not need insurance to enter Switzerland, but for your own confidence and wallet safety it is a must! Treatment in Switzerland is very expensive, besides, insurance saves you from having to look for a clinic or run for medicines, you never know what can happen. So take care of everything in advance and your journey will go smoothly.",solotravel,CoolKidsBlogs

Working and learning a language.,"Hi guys,  
I'm taking a break while studying and looking to go work abroad for a year. I live in Belgium and am studying finance and insurance. The reason I'm taking a break is because I feel that I need to get out of my routine and go find myself. I am not completely sure if I am who I am (if that makes sense to anyone). A friend of mine went to Australia for a year and came back full of motivation and knowing what he wanted to achieve in life. I'm not saying that the same will happen to me. But if I don't do this now I will never do it.  


I was planning on going to the south of France for at least 8 months. I have a lot of experience as a bartender. But I do have some concerns. My french is not great so I'm also going to learn a new language and culture. I however don't know how to begin. I've looked at workaway and found some nice places to stay for my first 2 months. I'm not sure if it is a good idea to buy a membership. Does anybody have any experience with this site. I have some money saved but I will need to work. Do the people of workaway pay a salary because I can't seem to find anything about it on the site itself.

I will be living in France for a long time so I need a place to rent, I don't know if that is easy to do especially during this pandemic.

Cooking While Traveling In a Camper Van?,"I'm looking for advice on cooking while I am out camping in Colorado for a week. I am traveling in a camper van that comes equipped with a single burner gas stove and a frying pan. I'm fairly certain there is a fire pan in effect in the state of Colorado so I don't think I will be able to use an open fire for cooking. I will be staying in various campgrounds. I'll eat pretty much anything.

My main concerns are whether or not the food will store well for the 7 days I am traveling and whether or not they will leave waste /smells that will attract wildlife? The last thing I want is to wake up to a bear trying to get in the van or hanging out around the site.

I will have a cooler and I can probably find places to get ice fairly easy so that should help with storage, but I don't want a lot of strong smells since the van is a rental and there are wild life concerns.

I imagine most campsites will have areas where I can properly dispose of any waste like cooking grease or things of that nature but I would like to be sure before I do.",solotravel,saltynalty17

This is exactly why I travel solo,"I always travel alone because either friends don't have enough money or the time. I traveled a week ago to cancun with my supposedly best friend and it was horrible! I wanted to kill her the first day. She got super drunk, vomited everywhere and embarrassed me every single day. I wasn't able to enjoy my vacation at all, she wanted to constantly eat when I just wanted to chill, be by the pool and look at the ocean. Ugh honestly I wish I didnt go with her. We are not talking anymore and this ruined our friendship. Im definitely going back solo traveling again! I can do what I want when I want to.

Edit: what I shared with you guys was something small. We talked prior to the trip and she is awful at communicating so I would literally have to read her eyes to know what was happening. I would want to be alone with other people I met but she will be following me all the time. There was a lot of drama which I hate, fights with other people among other things. 

I know we are both at fault so you guys can stop insulting me. The purpose of this post was to say why I travel solo nothing else. I do get drunk but I dont need anyone to take care of me thats the difference.

What sparked your interest to travel?,"I'm sure everyone has a moment where they knew they were meant to travel and explore..These moments are special and definitely keeps us ignited. 

Personally, when I was a child, I used to LOVE riding the airplane, sitting at the window, and gazing at sky. It was magical. I remember the day before every flight I couldn't sleep because of how excited I used to be to reach the airport and explore the *very* expensive shops there, ride on a plane and think to myself what should I eat this time(I LOVE bread and butter), and most importantly just opening the window and getting lost in the view.

Even now, I am 19 F, and trying my best to have a side hustle, save up money, learn languages, and go abroad for couple of years. I used to envy my friends who travel to study abroad! (I still do lol)

So yeah I think it came naturally to me , and tbh, I can see why. Traveling very much suits my personality (love to learn, explore, try new stuff that are not very ""suitable"" for me lol)

Missing Ireland,"I'll get right into it. I haven't really traveled this year, my last travel was a cruise to mexico in Dec 2019 with my GF and my god I regret cruises, nothing against them they just aren't my thing. ANYWAYS, I woke up in one of those depressed moods today and in attempt for a pick me up I decided to pick up my favored drinks from when I studied abroad in Ireland. Guinness and Carlsberg, my two favorite beers while I was there. As I sip away I am reminded of great nights with great friends and freedom. 

I don't know if anyone else feels the same but, there is such a genuine sense of freedom and happiness when I traveled abroad. Thousands of miles from anyone who knows you and you can just be yourself and live such a genuine life. When I studied abroad I went without knowing a single person and the ability to just live is something I have missed every single day since. The ability to not worry about any expectations or any responsibilities except for the ones I chose. 

For me Ireland was what hooked me on solo travel and I miss it so much at this moment, more than I am proud to admit (probably why I am here talking on reddit). I don't know if its just me or if its something inherent with your early 20's where you are just going through some kind of quarter life crisis but idk, does anyone else feel this way?

Trip report: Rome + Milan,"Hi all,  

I just got back from a week in Italy, where I spent 4 days in Rome and a day in Milan. 

I ended up flying into Milan from London and then catching a train to Rome. This was due to flight prices and availability as a result of the last-minute nature of my trip. 

Getting through security in both airports was quick and painless. I suspect this is because there are fewer travellers ~ a common theme on this trip. 

On arrival in Milan, I had to fill out a piece of paper listing the details of the trip (e.g. address of accommodation etc.) for COVID. I took the Malpensa express into the city centre of Milan, which takes around an hour.

From there, I took a _Frecciarossa Express_ train down to Rome. This took around 3 hours. It was a comfortable journey down where there were many empty seats. I had all four seats and a table for myself. You are asked to wear a mask for the whole journey. They provided a pack (gloves, mask, sanitiser, water etc.) on the train.

## Rome

### Accommodation

I stayed in an Air-BnB in _Trastevere_ for the duration of the trip. The restaurants were operating and there was some nightlife (people hanging around, buskers etc.). It took about 15-30 mins to get into the city centre on foot, depending on where I was trying to get to. Generally, public transport was not that convenient from where I stayed. I did get two Ubers when I was worried I was going to be late (i.e. the first tour and the train back to Milan).

If I went again, I think I would try to stay in Monti. Currently, you can get some good deals accommodation wise.

### Weather

The weather in Rome is very warm. It reached mid-thirties (Celsius) every day by noon. This meant I was always wearing short and a t-shirt. It also meant I was drenched in sweat from all the walking. It stayed warm late into the night. Thankfully, I had AC in my flat. There are also mosquitoes, so don't make the mistake of leaving the windows open! 

### Sights

I did two paid walking tours on two separate days:

- Colosseum, Roman Forum and Palatine Hill
- The Vatican, Sistine Chapel and St Peter's Basilica

There were about 10-15 people on both tours. All the sights were pretty light on tourists and there wasn't much of a wait to get into any of the sights. As an anecdotal comparison, our tour guide said usually there would be 40 tour groups at the meeting spot before our Vatican tour. We were the only tour group there. 

As a result, it was an amazing experience being able to see the sights in such comfort. All the sights were open from what I understand.

I normally do the free walking tours (with the tipping at the end), but the paid ones came with tickets to get into the sights and a very informative guide in my case. The company I did them with is _City Wonders_.

### Foodies

I love to cook/eat and it's always a big part of my holidays. FYI, every restaurant requires you to wear a mask upon entering the restaurant.

Here are the places I went to and can recommend:

- Roscioli Salumeria con Cucina ~ **everything** for lunch or dinner! 
  - I had the carbonara, but this place is a must in my opinion. I wished I had more time to go a second time!
  - Call ahead and book as it is popular. Solo travellers can get a spot at the bar. 
  - It is the only place that was a little pricy but well worth it.
- Bonci Pizzarium ~ **pizza** and deep-fried breaded balls with fillings inside. 
  - Best to do this the same day you go the Vatican as it's that side of town. 
  - It's more a hole in the wall/takeaway joint but there are some stand-up tables outside.
- Otaleg ~ **gelato** - very nice flavours of ice cream or sorbets. Great relief in the heat. 
  - It's in _Trastevere_, so maybe tie it in with a meal from around there, e.g. Pizza from _Da Poeta_.
- Da Bucatino ~ Cacio e pepe! Rich and creamy. 
  - I would say the food was good, but there wasn't much around the area that I saw. I ended up in the area after exploring.

I had good food at a few other places randomly with travellers I met and they were delicious but maybe not worthy to go out of the way for.

Generally, I think everyone should try the 4 classic pasta dishes when in Rome ~ _Cacio e pepe_, _Carbonara_, _Amatriciana_ and _Alla gricia_. The wine was also amazing, although I am not much in the way of a wine connoisseur. ;)

-----

## Milan

I ended up with half a day as there was a delay on the train back from Rome. I stayed at a hotel next to the Milano Centrale train station for convenience as I had to get to the airport for an early flight the next day.

I went for a walk to see the Cathedral ~ _Duomo_. It is impressive even without going inside. I didn't seem much else as the weather turned.

Aside from that, I just had dinner at _Ratana_, which was amazing. Great food and wine. I had the _Milanese risotto with veal_ and for desert the _watermelon granita_. Both were amazing. Slightly pricy but worth it as my final meal in Italy.

Hope this helps someone!",solotravel,pwee167
How to solo travel for one week in pnw?,"I(30F) have moved to Seattle a little more than one year ago and have recently gotten my driving license. I would like to take a week off to refresh before the summer ends and travel solo for the first time around the pnw region. What is the best way to research for the same? Any itinerary suggestions? I have been to almost all of the famous places 3 hours around Seattle with friends and generally go on weekend hikes - would like to venture out to less known gems for a longer period of time.

**Past trips i have done in the area**

1. Weekend hiking trips to Colchuck, Greiders Lakes and such
2. Long weekend trips to Portland, crater lake, vancouver, hoh rainforest with friends

**When?**

Hopefully from next Monday if i can plan soon and if i get reservations :)

**Areas i was looking at**

1. Eastern washington (spokane?)
2. Oregon (around the coast)
3. Olympic national park (haven't done camping before)
4. San Juan islands (?)

**Budget**

Have good savings - won't hesitate to spend for more comfort and safety

**Length**

1 week

**Interests**

Checking out the area and local scene (sightseeing/bars/food)

Hiking

Camping (excited to try it but haven't done it before)

Does Hawaii have much of (solo) travelling scene?,Not intending this to be a low-effort post. I have looked around and most of what I can find seems to suggest the islands are either all-out tourist bar/noise/etc or isolated areas that locals don't want you to go to (fair enough). Is this simplificatin fairly accurate? Is it possible to travel between the islands easily and is there a hostel scene. Not intending to go until after covid btw.,solotravel,infinitepaths
How did your budget compare to what you actually spent? (SEA),"I'm worried that my estimates are too low and I'll need to spend more than I actually have. I'm doing the cheaper SEA countries &amp; India and am looking at about £1k per month. I have £8k available and want to travel for at least 6 months (7 countries) but was wondering if I somehow managed to stretch it to 10 months, would I just be over budgeting and ruining my experience?

I'll be staying in the cheapest hostels, eating street food mostly and will be taking cheaper transport seeing as I have no time limit. I will be doing semi-expensive tours but not often. For the most part I enjoy aimlessly walking around, drinking coffee, museums, beaches, hikes, taking photos... all the free stuff.  I also can't see myself drinking/partying.

In a tricky situation need help please,"Bought a roundtrip flight on priceline and used part of it already but need to reschedule my return flight for 42 days later. I was on the phone with priceline yesterday for almost 3 hours and they told me I can get a $500 credit for my unused portion of my ticket to reschedule the flight. The problem is, theyre trying to charge me $1500 to reschedule, so $1000 due after my $500 credit. I went to the priceline website to look for the same date+route and its only $750 to buy a brand new oneway ticket, so at most they shouldnt be charging me more than $400. So then I thought maybe I just got a bitter rep, and called again and this time I got a drunk priceline rep working from home and, nope, still $1500. So then I called the airline company to see if they could change it, nope... they could change my reservation but couldnt process the actual ticketing and told me I need to contact priceline to make changes. Priceline is trying to cheat me out of more than $500... I even told the priceline rep why would I pay $1000 to reschedule my flight when I can just buy a one way with the exact same route from your priceline website for only $750... and the rep said our website is negotiated prices, we're only authorized to give you retail prices.... so then I went on google flights and even still the price for that route was $930 still lower than the $1500 priceline is trying to charge me. I wouldnt mind the 930, but to charge $1500 which is 100% higher than their own website prices and higher than retail price is just absurd. My return flight that I need to reschedule is in 4 days and Im running out of time and no where to turn to. Ive spent almost 5 hours the past 2 days talking to endless reps and this is my first time traveling international and have not much options at this point.

Edit: I didnt mention that I was originally quoted $973 minus 500 credit to change my flight but call got disconnected with priceline rep. And when I called back within the hour, they said price is now $1500 and when I told them how in the world did the price change +100% within 30 mins for a ticket scheduled 1.5 months later, they said prices are always fluctuating... then I said fine give me another route... and the rep quoted me the same, $1500.


The type of ticket I have was a flexible economy ticket so it allows no-hassle rescheduling as long as I pay the difference in the ticket price however the only issue is that only priceline is authorized to change my ticket and Im not authorized to do so with the airline directly.",solotravel,finaldestan1

Story time! Dropping phone in river in Japan.,"Last year I went on my first solo trip in Japan, I had the time of my life. I spent 23 days in total. I went to Tokyo (14days), Kyoto (3days), Osaka (3 days), and Nikko (3 days).

Anyway it was my first day in Nikko , I was staying a pretty awesome hostel called Nikko Earth Hostel. It was right on a river, incredible spot really. I was sharing some Sake with some friends I met at the hostel, sitting on the rocks right in front of the river. I had my phone in my pocket, and all the sudden it slides out of my pocket and slides off the rocks into the river. I instinctively jumped in with all my clothes in to try to recover it (it was dark), and I could not find it, being that it would’ve been broken anyway it didn’t matter much.

Keep in mind it’s my first solo trip in a foreign country, let alone one with such a intricate transportation system. My phone was how I navigated the entire trip, so I was freaking out for the first day. Especially because I had to somehow navigate my way all the way from the mountains in Nikko, to my terminal in Narita, with no help. 

It was definitely an experience. Especially because I got sick after jumping in the river, and I couldn’t hear out of my left ear at all, so I had to try extra hard to hear the train announce the stations and such.

I managed to make it to my terminal, and it was honestly a great and empowering experience that I was able to do this all on my own. It added another element to my trip, not constantly looking at my phone for directions. 

I just wanted to share lol :)

Resources for travel in Switzerland.,"Not a single trip report, but more of a collection of experience and lessons from many trips. I don't think I have posted this here before, it might be useful in this very long planning period. 

Most of my travel here as day or week long trips has been solo travel. This is probably as safe and easy a solo destination as you are going to get. People hiking or biking across the country by themselves is commonplace, eating isn't a group thing like in some countries, and other than maybe a few activities that require a booking with a minimal group size you won't find yourself excluded from anything. I have never had any problems (though as a white male it might be easier for me to avoid them, I can't speak for other demographics).

The only real factor for me regarding solo travel here has been that if you really want to meet other travelers then it will be much easier at a hostel in a more popular area (ie Interlaken/Luzern/Zermatt) than if you go off to other forms of accommodation in the lesser known regions. There are hostels all over the country, but many (especially the YHAs) tend to attract domestic Swiss tourists of various ages rather than an international scene. 

The Swiss are not going to embrace you like a family member, but are friendly in their own way. I have never had a problem getting help (even without a mutual language), sharing tables at relaxed places like mountain restaurants is quite standard (once all the empty ones are partially occupied), and sometimes they will be very chatty in a way that still surprises me sometimes. Speaking the local language makes it much easier to get talking with people, but English often works everywhere (too well given that I still have issues getting people to talk to me in German sometimes).

* This is mostly aimed at English speakers, those who speak the local languages will have far more options. 

* I live in the German speaking area so I am very heavily biased to the sights and culture there just through my daily experience.

* I am a little insufferable at always wanting to be different, so I tend to be a bit harsher on popular/famous places than unknown ones. You should try and mentally correct for that.

**Misc tips:**

* Swiss vs European power plug adapters - not always compatible! If you have an EU plug it might not fit into a Swiss socket, but newer ones should do (roughly speaking when the two prongs are 4mm or less in diameter, and 14mm apart they should work in both the EU and Switzerland).

* Cable cars typically stop running at around 5pm (but can be until 10pm or so if it is servicing a village like Mürren). This is especially deceptive in summer when it stays light until much later. Check when the last run is, the internet is full of stories of people who found themselves with a long walk down in the dark. 

---

**Internet - practical**

Many of these also have a phone app version which is worth having.

General:

* [My Switzerland](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-au/home.html). The official and very extensive tourism website. Just about any information you could possibly need about anything is on here.

* [Wikivoyage](https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Switzerland). A bit hit and miss: the overview and coverage for places like Zürich is fantastic, but many places are lacking in useful or any info. 

* Local tourist areas all have their own websites. Usually in both summer and winter versions, giving you info on: conditions, what is open,  ideas for what to do, etc:. Eg: [Jungfrau region](https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/), [Zermatt](https://www.zermatt.ch/en), [Appenzell](http://www.appenzell.ch/en/home.html), and so on.

Transport:

* You can get regional travel passes which cover all transport and cable cars in specific areas (Eg: the [Jungfrau region](https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/jungfrau-travel-pass/), or the [Tell pass](http://www.tellpass.ch/en/summer/experience/whats_the_tell-pass/) around Luzern). Likewise there are endless [passes for museums etc in each region](https://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/gaestekarten.html). 

* [SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html). The website (and also app) for the train network covering buses, boats, and cable cars too. Timetables, ticket info, and pass info. It is sometimes better to look up the timetable for seasonal things like cable cars and boats on their own websites (eg: [BLS boats on Brienzersee](https://www.bls.ch/en/fahren/unterwegs-mit/schiff/fahrplan), or [cable cars in the Aletsch region](https://www.aletscharena.ch/cableways/timetable/)) as when they don’t run the SBB just gives a vague “can’t find the connection” notice. They do various [travel passes](https://www.sbb.ch/en/leisure-holidays/travel-in-switzerland/international-guests.html), though it is best to carefully calculate your planned routes or figure out if it is worth it It is worth looking for the off-peak “super saver” tickets which limit you to a certain train but can cut the price in half (and if you have the half-tax this cuts the price again, to as much as 75% off).   


Accommodation

* Official accommodation (which should include Airbnb) will offer a guest card in many tourist areas including free/discounted local transport and activities. Typically this is just in the town/village and places 10-20 minutes away ([eg for Interlaken]( https://www.interlaken.ch/en/info-service/gaestekarten/interlaken-guest-card)), but in the beautiful and underrated canton of Ticino [it covers the entire canton]( https://www.ticino.ch/en/ticket.html). 

* Aside from the standard options for finding rooms you might also want to look into other options such as https://alp.holidaybooking.ch/?language=en, and https://www.rooms.ch/ . Many smaller independent options (especially farms and rural hotels) are not on Booking.com etc and you will have to find them by trawling around on google maps. This could help if you really want to stay in a certain area but everything is booked out, but many of them have a very basic setup so you might need to phone up or fill in a form on their website.

* Another option that might be worth considering is the [Swiss Hotel Card]( https://hotelcard.com/en?change_locale=en), a 99CHF per year subscription that offers half priced hotel rooms. This is limited to participating hotels and doesn’t apply during the high season, but could easily pay for itself with just a single night or weekend. I have yet to try this, but the range of locations looks like it could be quite good for domestic travellers. 

* For more rural hut and farm based accommodation: https://bnb.ch/ , and https://www.bauernhof-ferien.ch/ , and https://www.myfarm.ch/en/accommodation , and https://naturfreunde.ch/haeuser/ . Some like myfarm.ch offer the chance to sleep on straw in a barn.

* Alpine huts are run by a few different organisations. [The SAC website]( https://www.sac-cas.ch/en/) is the best starting point.

* Camping. Standard campsites: www.tcs.ch , www.camping.ch , and www.sccv.ch. In addition there are a few websites where you can officially find a small patch to pitch up on a farm https://www.nomady.ch/ , and [on myfarm.ch too](https://www.myfarm.ch/de/campingplatz-zeltplatz#dontPreselectRegion=true&amp;resultsPerPage=&amp;tagIds=-3360035520941820).

* Wild camping is complex. The best way to sum it up is ""Prohibited but tolerated under conditions"". [This SAC page has the most official guidelines]( https://www.sac-cas.ch/de/umwelt/bergsport-und-umwelt/campieren-und-biwakieren/). There are some pointers for the ideal situation (the more you follow the better): above the treeline, with the community / landowner’s permission, [not in a protected area]( https://map.geo.admin.ch/?lang=de&amp;layers=ch.bafu.wrz-wildruhezonen_portal,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-auen,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-hochmoore,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-flachmoore_regional,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-flachmoore,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-jagdbanngebiete,ch.bafu.schutzgebiete-schweizerischer_nationalpark,ch.bafu.bundesinventare-trockenwiesen_trockenweiden&amp;layers_opacity=0.9,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.75&amp;bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&amp;zoom=0&amp;topic=ech&amp;E=2643780.17&amp;N=1164842.39), single tent, set up as the sun goes down and dismantle at dawn, no fire/noise/disturbance/litter. Wild camping has increased in popularity in recent years, [iconic spots like Seealpsee are having problems with numbers]( https://www.fm1today.ch/ostschweiz/appenzellerland/zu-viele-wildcamper-am-seealpsee-135572094), so try and pick a less known spot.

Weather:

* For weather there is [Search.ch](https://meteo.search.ch/grindelwald) which also includes a few webcams and ski info in winter, or [Meteoswiss](http://www.meteoswiss.admin.ch/) which has a useful country map.

* There are lots of high-resolution webcams. Check official websites for resorts and cable cars (eg: [Jungfrau region]( https://www.jungfrau.ch/en-gb/live/webcams/)), or [roundshot]( https://www.roundshot.com/xml_1/internet/en/application/d170/f172.cfm) for the best.

Maps:

* [Switzerland Mobility](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/summer.html). Detailed map showing all official routes for hiking/biking/skating…. With lots of short and long suggested routes. If you sign up for the (paid) Pro version then you can plan routes on the map with detailed height information and pretty good time estimates. [for example](https://map.schweizmobil.ch/?lang=de&amp;showLogin=true&amp;bgLayer=pk&amp;season=summer&amp;resolution=10&amp;E=2746778&amp;N=1236988&amp;trackId=3334166). 

* [map.geo.admin.ch](https://map.geo.admin.ch) (mobile app - Swisstopo). The official govt map is amazing. Quick to load and use on desktop or mobile. You can toggle useful overlays like hiking paths (in some ways better than Mobility above as the levels are shown and the contrast makes it much clearer), and just about anything else from geological features to ski runs, you can even switch to historic versions of the map going back to the mid 1800s and watch the country grow. It will even convert any section you like to PDF for easy saving and printing. All for free.

* When actually out and about I tend to use **Maps.me** on my phone which has rather good coverage of the footpath system and addresses/businesses. That said it does have some big gaps in some areas. I wouldn’t use it for advanced routes, but to check my position and where a certain side path might take me it is mostly very useful. The directions feature sometimes gives good advice and sometimes decides that a perfectly good bit of path can’t be used and that you should take a 3 hour detour. The time calculator does not take height change into account, so do not trust that either.

**Internet - culture**

* [Swissinfo.ch](https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng) Swiss news and topics in English.

* [Thelocal.ch](https://www.thelocal.ch/) is more of the same.

* [Newlyswissed](https://www.newlyswissed.com/) is yet more Swiss news with a focus on cultural tips for those adjusting to Switzerland. Though it can be somewhat fluffy click-bait (actually it is mostly pretty crap really).

* Beer. There are apparently more breweries per person in Switzerland than anywhere else in the world. The impressive one man website [Bov.ch](https://www.bov.ch/beer/index-Y.html) maps and is working hard to review them all.

* Music to get you in the mood. Many of the bigger Swiss artists like [Anna Rossinelli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ3T3M22lAA), and [Stefanie Heinzmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WHqq4TmW5k) sing in English (understandable with a slightly bigger potential audience) but there are a surprising number that sing in Swiss-German. In no particular order of name or genre: [Bligg]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixLsLFncL5g) (where else can you see someone rapping and posing on a Zürich skyscraper?), [Kunz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Quf4cT7BR0), [Nemo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hCmUQdDGeE), [Lo und Leduc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APxnaonpOes), [Dabu Fantastic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_I8HH2N_qQ), [Züri West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Gd4YIFM7ck), [Baschi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghlPjtl7RDY), [Patent Ochsner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzC9oX8O1_M), [Marc Sway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S96gICNe-eE), [De Luca](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zoUuLviHHE), [Müslüm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXQlMgiPd8k), [Hedgehog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uCeZx501iU), [Subzonic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cj9iDNWSwQ), [Span](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0cGfU4WNoxM), [Mani Matter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkGatIgXERI), [Steff la Cheffe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5YhjiupY08), and [Dodo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6F6KwZa-Es). Having written all that I then just found [this big youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K1HrtVjwfFc&amp;list=PLsIqMR6rh5PYeH_HmqkOwzVzl1RBkr5ab). Or if you want to go REALLY Swiss you can go fully native and crash through into the world of [folk-Schlager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReKkGqqYTwU) (at this point you are out-Swissing most of the Swiss who would run up a mountain to avoid that). [This however may be the peak of awful campy self-aware Swissness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAwU40AFw9w) (my apologies to every Swiss person who was just reminded about the existence of that). However [this]( https://youtu.be/5zWrb2Oa1cs?t=102) may top that to be the most amazingly bad Swiss thing ever.

* If you speak any of the national languages then the [Swiss broadcasting Corporation]( https://www.srgssr.ch/de/start/) has plenty to offer in each. For example with German there is the SRF is who do a mix of High-German and Swiss-German telly and radio. [SRF Play](https://www.srf.ch/play/tv) is their on demand TV/radio website and app. They are very good at putting their full shows onto youtube - [the main SRF Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SchweizerFernsehen) has quite a bit of content (and there are other [specialised official channels too](https://www.youtube.com/user/SchweizerFernsehen/channels?disable_polymer=1)). Radio podcasts are on [the SRF website](https://www.srf.ch/podcasts) and on Spotify (and probably other places too), for Swiss-German check SRF1 (especially the regionaljournal channels) and SRF3, and for the hardcore the Hörspiel channel often has full plays in Swiss-German.

* [I rather like the SRF archive for the historical videos which can normally be enjoyed without the language.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd0NmHBRRAq5O-ye7kx_VlQ)

-------------------------------


**Books**

* Swiss Watching - Diccon Bewes (2010). Switzerland seen through British eyes. A very readable and enjoyable introduction to the history, people, politics and areas of the country by someone who has lived there for years. Ideal reading as a traveller. There are some over generalisations but given the scope and size it mostly does a good job. If you read anything about Switzerland make it this. [He also has a Google-talk video which is basically a condensed version of the book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7u--e31oOc&amp;) 

* Slow train to Switzerland - Diccon Bewes (2013). The author retraces the first Thomas Cook tour of Switzerland and shows how much has changed since then and by the rise of trains and tourism. A very interesting read for the history and travel ideas. 

* Around Switzerland in 80 Maps - Diccon Bewes (2015).Yet another Diccon book, though this is much more history and culture than travel based. At a large 33x23cm it isn’t travel friendly either, but it is beautifully done with a range of well reproduced images and interesting information. It is accessible and interesting to everyone, but I would say this book is most enjoyable to those who already know the Swiss landscape, history and culture to some extent already. The [TedX talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a480xM9kFyA) that he does on the subject is rather good.

* The [Bergli publisher](https://www.bergli.ch/), which Diccon is part of, have quite a few light hearted books about Swiss culture and Switzerland.

* How the English Made the Alps - Jim Ring (2000). A history of how the development of tourism, climbing, and winter sports played a major role in the development of the Alps. Not just Switzerland, but it is a major focus of the book.

* A Tramp Abroad - Mark Twain (1880). [FREE EBOOK](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/119). Satirical and absurd account of his travels in Europe. The Swiss part is often hilarious. As above is interesting to see just how much the country has changed since then. Several places such as [Weggis-Rigi](https://www.rigi.ch/Vor-Ort/Rigi-Kulm/Wanderwege-ab-Rigi-Kulm/Mark-Twain-Weg) and [Zermatt-Riffelberg](https://www.zermatt.ch/en/Media/Planning-hikes-tours/Mark-Twain-Weg) have Theme walks in the approximate places where he walked himself. A tramp in this sense is to walk, not the homeless person as most people other than the Kiwis might assume.

* Sherlock Holmes - The Final Problem - Arthur Conan Doyle (1893). [FREE EBOOK](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/d/doyle/arthur_conan/d75me/). A quick and easy read of Holmes' ""final"" adventure ending at the Reichenbach falls by Meiringen. He oversells the waterfall somewhat though I must say. 

* The Magic Mountain - Thomas Mann (1924). Inspired by and set in a Davos mountain health retreat. No comment as have yet to read it.

* Heidi - Johanna Spyri (1881). [FREE EBOOK](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/20781). The classic kids book which seems to be something of cliché and sales-device these days ([for a start you can visit a fake Heidi house in Heidi village](http://www.heididorf.ch/en/about-us/heidis-village.html)). It is only partly happy alpine adventures, and often rather painfully moralistic. Read until she is put on a train to Frankfurt and that should be enough.

* William Tell - Friedrich Schiller (1804). [FREE EBOOK](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/6788). Performed every year in Interlaken amongst other places. Frankly it is really blood boring - the whole thing can be summed up that the Swiss are good christian brothers, and the Austrians are utter wankers.

* Bill Bryson passes through in his 1991 book “Neither here nor there”. While still mostly a good read, being almost 30 years old the info is rather outdated in parts. The country has become much more lively since then for a start.

* La Place de la Concorde Suisse - John McPhee (1984). A very out-dated but in some ways interesting read looking at Swiss military thinking and culture back in the 80s. The attitudes and situation are very different now over 30 years later. This is only really worth it if you really want to learn about that bit of Swiss history. It also commits the cardinal sin of having numerous bits of French scattered about the book but with no translation provided, which is really bloody annoying.


If your German is good then:

* Von Casanova bis Churchill - Barbara Piatti (2016). A series of articles about famous visitors to Switzerland.

I am also interested in the medieval times, specifically the castles / ruines of castles, so any of those that could be recomended would be greatly apreciated aswell.

I am on the other hand NOT interested in going to big cities, they are just not my piece of cake

Just drive off?,"Hello,
I am living in Germany in a pretty big city and I have a pretty good life if I can say so. I have a lot of friends, so a nice private life and I am self employed.

Leaving corporate life to travel,"  I’ve worked at my office job for about 9 months now and I’ve realized it’s not the right fit for me. Before this I’ve had other office jobs and I thought this would be better because it’s in an industry I’m interested in, but it didn’t really make a difference. Corporate life is what it is at least to me. I’ve worked retail before which I actually prefer, but having managers and dealing with customers gets old after a while.  

  I’m 25 and currently living with family. I feel it’s time for me to be on my own. I’ve looked at places in my city, but I don’t think I even want to live here anymore. I feel I need a change of scenery and new experiences. 

  I started taking an online coaching program on the side to learn how to create an online business where I’m able to work with people one on one remotely. Ideally, I’ll have this up and running by the time I plan to move so it can be my livelihood while I travel. 

  I’m planning to go to Guadalajara for a few months the beginning of 2021. That gives me some more time to save, plan, and for things with the pandemic to hopefully settle down.

  I chose GDL because I have some relatives that live there, I haven’t visited since I was a kid, and I want to perfect my Spanish. I’ve travelled solo many times, but this will be the first time I’ll be gone for more than a couple weeks. I figured this is a safe bet to start off with because I can have my own place and still have family in the city in case of anything. 

  I currently have about 20k saved up. I plan to get global health insurance, so that I’m covered whether I’m traveling or home in the U.S. I’m thinking of staying for at least 2 months and seeing if I want to stay there or go somewhere else. 

  I can always come back home if need be, but I am seeking an independent lifestyle. Does anybody have advice or suggestions on this topic? I’d really appreciate it.",solotravel,leangreenqueen
Travel ideas for first-time solo female traveller?,"Hi everyone, my big plans for 2020 fell through (I was supposed to do an exchange semester at UCLA) and so I have a bunch of money saved up that I would like to use for something nice. I am 21F, have a budget of about 2.5k euros (without flights) and would like to travel outside of Europe. I have never solo travelled before but I am quite a skilled traveler in general (I know to avoid scams etc). I would still like to go somewhere safe though, safety is one of my biggest concerns about this whole solo travel thing but it’s something I would really like to try. I have the whole month of January off from school/work and would like to look into the possibility of travelling then. However, if it’s still very complicated by then to arrange travelling, I would prefer waiting for things to go back to normal as much as possible. I would like to go on a long holiday of at the very least 3 weeks bc I feel like if I invest time and money in a long-haul flight, I should explore the place thoroughly.
For now I’ve checked some flight prices to see where I could actually afford to go, and my best bet seems to be SE Asia. I’ve also researched this online a bit to see where I could go on my budget comfortably and most people are recommending Thailand.
My interests when travelling are visiting monuments/temples or other built heritage, cool natural landscapes (although I am not much into hiking so preferably easily reachable nature), vegetarian(!) food and I am also reaaally interested in Buddhism and would love to learn more about it.
I would appreciate it if you could share some tips or places that you, as women, travelled to and had a good experience in so I get a few ideas of where to look! Thank you.",solotravel,datdashdoe

Solo Cabo Trip End Of September. 28m,"Hi All,

As the title states, I’m heading to Cabo at the end of September for 8 days. I’ll be staying at the Riu Palace (all inclusive). 

My friends either couldn’t afford to go (no judgement) or couldn’t get the time off, so I’m going solo!

I did an Alaskan cruise by myself last year and loved the flexibility of doing whatever I want whenever I want. 

I enjoy my own time, so I’m not too worried about being “lonely”, I’m good enough at making new friends as well if needed. 

My question is, are prices for excursions and activities generally priced for 2 people? Are there going to be any issues with me booking solo excursions?

What are your suggestions for solo excursions? I’d like to do a full day fishing trip, a scuba diving day trip, jet skiing, dune buggying... etc. Anything else you would suggest?

I know it’s one of those things to “not care what others think about you”, but is it weird to go on these dinner cruises solo? 😂

"Is there a website to search boat and ferry trips, similar to searching for flights?","As the title suggests. I like to incorporate water transportation (boat, ferry, etc.) into my travels. Whether it is between countries (ex: ferry from South Korea to Vladivostok, Russia) or within a country (Thai islands).

Where are the best spas &amp; thermal baths in the world?,"I noticed that people on this subreddit always ask about the best hostels, best food, best bars, best nightlife, best museums, etc. but no one ever talks about the best spas in the world.

I think travel &amp; relaxation go hand in hand so I always try to visit some spas wherever I visit. Yes, I know, as solo travellers and backpackers sometimes we try to save every penny on the cheapest flights and hostels but it’s OK to splurge on yourself too. 

One of the most famous countries for this is Hungary. Szechenyi Baths, Gellert Baths, etc. are really famous and the architecture there is just gorgeous.

Planning to spend 4-5 months living in 3-4 European cities. TOP choices.,"I am planning to go to Europe in my gap year and spend 4-5 months there. I prefer way much ""slow travel"" in order to soak the culture in, speak the language, meet new people, and actually have a deep experience of the place.
I LOVE history, doing a wide range of activities, meeting new people and speaking their language. I am planning to learn Italian (Currently learning German and French). I want to be able to use these languages when I travel.

I have 3 places in my mind so far and would like your opinion and other recommendations:

1) Berlin: planning to spend 1.5 months here, while still exploring other cities in Germany such as Hamburg, Münich and other ""smaller"" cities. I have a very huge passion for Germany, its history and language. So I may extend the stay here.

2)Rome: Planning to also spend 1.5 months here. I chose Rome because I hear it is underrated and there are LOTS of stuff to do. There are other cities such as Milan and Venice that are also competing for this spot, your input here would be greatly appreciated ;).

3) Paris: Also 1.5 months. Obviously, Paris is the most well known city in Europe ( if not the world lol), but I was wondering are there any other suggestions for French cities to spend at least a month there?  

I will still be interrailing to other places such as Amsterdam, Brussels, Budapest, etc..

Although I am interested in any recommendations you may have en route, I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how best to book TSR ideally with stops, awkward visa applications (most likely Russia/China) but mainly best method for the money situation? I have Transferwise card which seems reliable (open to any better suggestions!) And realise I can't go wrong carrying USD.

First *planned* solo trip!,"Hey!

So I have my first planned solo trip coming up and I’m looking for suggestions! I am spending 4 days in Bar Harbor, Maine. I’m not super comfortable eating alone without feeling like a complete loner, little nervous about being in unknown territory without anyone close by in case of emergency.. 

Backstory: I had planned a trip 4 years ago to visit a friend living in California for a week, long story short, day of my flight she basically left me stranded. I ended up having only a few hours to find a place to stay that night and some kind of transportation for the week. It ended up being one of the greatest trips of my life, and by the end I was so happy with how it all turned out. I ended up in 3 cities, 800 miles on a rental car, and a love for solo travel. I didn’t have time to think, I just went, and it was beautiful. I am usually a planner. 

This time I have a plan, activities, and have had time to think 🤣 I’m looking for other people’s experiences, like how do you do meals, any advice? Have you met locals on your journeys, and how? Thank you!",solotravel,kristinenowak
Central America hostel advice!,"I am in the process of planning a San José - Mexico City trip for November - January. Obviously this is dependent on borders but I need something to look forward to so thought I'd start planning a potential trip. I have just over 2 months off work during that time. 

Here is my general plan for now. San José - Nicaragua - Honduras - El Salvador - Guatemala - Belize - Mexico City. 

(Start and endpoints are pretty non-negotiable as I live in San José and flying back from Mexico City is super cheap!)

I need some advice for cool hostels (good for meeting people, slightly quirky, great locations, great bars). Cities and more rural locations are both fine!

So far, I have seen a couple recommended on here, especially Surfing Turtle lodge in Nicaragua which looks awesome.

So, anymore? Any tips for activities/great places I HAVE to visit? Decent Spanish schools? This is my first time travelling Central America so any recommendations are really welcome.

I'll do a detailed trip report on return!",solotravel,swingingpendulums
Shoes for a RTW trip,"Hoping to head on a RTW trip for at least two years after I graduate, always find shoes the hardest thing to pack.

I always take a pair of cheap flip flops for beaches etc. and my Birkenstock’s but I’m struggling to find a pair of light close toed shoes (for a female) for some light hiking but that I could also wear casually, if anyone has recommendations! I’m also struggling to decide whether to bring my Doc Martens, which I wear almost daily here at home and find so versatile, it’s just the weight/space I’m worried about.

10 days in Mexico itinerary help.,"Hey all. I’m going to Mexico for 10 days in mid-December. I fly into Mexico City and out of Cozumel. My focus is culture, food, but especially seeing ruins/pyramids. Rough itinerary, and I apologize if this is not the best formatting, is:

Mexico City (4 days, 3 nights). Merida (3 days, 2 nights). Tulum (3 days, 2 nights). Cozumel (3 days, 2 nights).

Would fly from Mexico City to Merida. Bus from Merida to Tulum. Ferry to Cozumel. Hoping I’m not doing too much in 10 days. I’m hoping the locations will be good to see some ruins/pyramids. I know I can get good food and experience the culture in each place.

What type of travel do you prefer?,"Are you someone that would rather fit in as many destinations as possible into your solo travel itinerary, if it comes at the cost of your overall travel time?

Or are you willing to visit fewer places, if it means you can travel for longer?

I'm currently saving up for what I'm hoping is an epic solo adventure three or four years down the line and have no idea if I'd prefer a more grandiose adventure that covers 30+ countries within a year, or a more subdued trip covering 10-20 countries in three years or so.

It'd be interesting to hear your perspectives on the type of solo travel you prefer and why, especially if you are looking to travel, have travelled or are currently travelling over a longer period of time (6 months plus).

I suppose there's no right or wrong answer to this question since we all find enjoyment in different ways, but I'm curious as to whether there is a general consensus or not.",solotravel,KaleJunkie
I need some specific advice,"Hello. I am 18 years old and looking for some very specific advice. I am going to college soon for 4 years and I am looking to do something pretty crazy when I am finished.

I feel I will be old enough once I am out of college to go out on my own and do this.

What Sized Backpack Should I Purchase?,"Post-COVID I'm going to solo travel to England for six months during autumn and winter. I'm female, and I'm good about packing light. I'm typically a size medium in all clothes.

CLOTHES
2 jeans, 7 t-shirts, 2 sweaters, 1 thermal, 2 bras, 14 underwear, 7 pairs of socks, 2 joggers, 2 beanies, 1 gloves, 1 puffy jacket (worn), 1 collapsable raincoat (day pack), 1 shower shoes, 1 trainers (worn)

TOILETRIES
Travel-sized toiletry bag (shampoo, conditioner, liquid soap, toothbrush, toothpaste, hair ties, deodorant, sink laundry packets, travel towel)

DAY PACK
Tiny umbrella, converter, phone charger, portable charger, tiny first aid kit, dry snacks, wallet, passport, phone, etc.

I plan to stay in hostels, and all I plan to travel with is a big backpack and a day pack. I will bring a collapsible duffel for extra things, which I can leave in Suffolk with a family member.

I'm thinking of getting an Osprey backpack for the trip, but I am unsure of what size would be best. I figure 30l is too small and 40l is too big, but it's hard to tell the actual size from just photos. Any suggestions are appreciated.",solotravel,pieapplekitten

- Are walking tours still operating with the current situation? Send your recommendations!
- Are restaurants operating as per normal?

Mental impact of covid...maybe you guys get it,"Hey all!

I’m posting here because I’m realizing that during these times, I’m feeling a huge lack of community. I’ve traveled to 49 countries, many of them solo. I have found that many solo travelers have some strange little quirks in common, so I’m wondering if anyone here can relate.

To me, I’m not overly concerned about covid. I’ve eaten street food off plates cleaned in very questionable water in Thailand, I’ve gone without hand sanitizer and toilet paper for months backpacking in South America, I’ve slept in questionably clean hostels all over the world, and laid my cheek on old school bus cushions that HAD to have been at least 50 years old. 

I love the world. And I’m worried. 

I’m the kind of person who loves strangers. I couch surf. I host couchsurfers. I trust strangers, and I rarely worry about people stealing from me or trying to hurt me in some way (I’m 36/f/Canadian). 

I invited strangers to my house for a New Year’s Eve intention setting party. I ran a meetup where we met in each other’s houses - not bars. I like real human beings and real connection. 

I just feel such a lack of community in these times. I am seriously worried that it will never go back to normal. I’m really sad to see that we have just accepted that this is the new normal - because to me, this feels terrible.

It feels like the opposite of the trust I have for strangers. I am scared we are getting comfortable with distance, and I hate it. I fear for my global community, and I’m concerned that things will never be the same. 

It hurts my soul. 

I feel like if I am ever to be able to return to normal, that my practices will be viewed as irresponsible. They were already borderline before.

New passport/ COVID-19 help!!!,"Hey all,

I booked a very expensive flight out of the country only to my horror to find my passport had expired.

Sleeping in airports?,"Hello all! Earlier this week, I impulsively bought plane tickets to los angeles for labor day weekend. My returning flight leave at 5 AM from LAX. I was considering just sleeping at the airport since I have to be there quite early, and also, to save money. Ive never done this, so I really don't know to much about it.. Has anyone done this at LAX? Is it still allowed, with Covid going on. Would I be able to check in 5 hours early? I will not have luggage, only a backpack.

Edit: will probably not be sleeping in the airport. People are up in arms about this, so imagine how people at the airport might react if I actually do it. To be honest, I'm not that worried about the virus (there i said it!), but I always strictly follow the safety protocols to be respectful to the public and to staff, and because i do understand there are some people who are extremely vulnerable to it. 

For people mentioning the wild fires in California, I am coming from a state also dealing with wildfires. The air quality here has been quite unbearable. In fact, the 6,000+  ft drop in elevation in Los Angeles will probably help me be able to breathe a little better! 

I hate to break it to some of you, but people are going to travel (no matter how much you disagree with it). People are tired of being stuck at home. For me personally, I will spend a couple of days alone at the beach, with some good books, and plan to stay put at home (other than doing some camping) after this trip. Ive talked to many people booking flights domestically, and a surprising number of people booking flights to Mexico right now. 

I appreciate all the suggestions! Was not expecting so much feedback. I am planning a more elaborate backpacking trip if the virus ever simmers down, and plan to do some MAD sleeping in airports when that time comes. I will definitely refer back to this thread!",solotravel,breas84

I had links to my socials in my last post, so it got taken down, but all of you were being super kind and supportive, answering some of my questions, and providing great advice. I didn't want it to end, so I'm reposting without the links. Apologies again! I'm super excited and wanted to share with likeminded travelers.

OG Post: Next week I'll be starting a once-in-a-lifetime trip. I'm furloughed through the end of the year and renting a camper van so I can responsibly travel and see what nature has to offer. I'll be staying mostly on the Western side of the US. I'll be doing this alone and living/staying in my van, so I will be having little to no interaction with anyone else. The most I will be doing is hiking in our beautiful national parks and keeping my distance from people.

I’ll be renting the Kuga camper van from Travellers Autobarn. General route is from San Francisco, up to Montana, over to ND and down the Great Plains, into the Ozarks, then following 40 most of the way back.

I've started a YouTube travel blog to document and share my stories and have a GoPro and some equipment. I'll be posting and sharing on my Instagram as well. I've also got a Poalrsteps, so my route can be mapped and family members can see where I am. I'm not going to enough National Parks to get one of those passport books. I'll be finding and rating places on iOverlander and Campendium.

I've never done anything like this and don't have much camping experience, so a few questions:

\- Any other technology you'd recommend I set up or start before I leave? I'd hate to find out about some awesome thing to do in each state or some type of tracker and have missed my chance.

\- I don't have a bathroom/shower in the van. I have an outdoor shower which will be fine, but any recs for toilet use are appreciated :)

\- I'll be spending a few days in the Ozarks, which I'm very unfamiliar with, so any recs there would be great!

\- Any big tips for van security? I'm going to have a lockbox/bike lock situation, but since it's a rental van, there isn't much more I can do.",solotravel,Serial_and_Milk
Seasonal jobs while travelling?,"I’m not sure this is the right sub but I’m looking for some ideas and don’t know where else to post.

Advice: Backpacking for 3-4 months with camera equipment.,"Depending on the state of covid next summer I plan on backpacking around Europe &amp; SEA for 3-4 months.

The main goal of this trip is to finally take the trip I’ve been talking about the past couple of years and just enjoy myself. I plan on staying in hostels (with more of a party/social atmosphere). I also decided while on the trip I want to extensively document everything by taking photos and videos/vlogs on my trip to make my own personal travel videos. Also only plan on bringing one big backpack that can fit my clothes and camera equipment in one. 

The reason I am asking for advice is because I have never travelled with any camera equipment or done a long solo trip in multiple countries. I have traveled several times before around Europe so I know what to expect in terms of getting around and staying in hostels. I have done research and decided on a drone, camera, and any extra equipment alongside it that I’ll need.

First fitting all of my stuff in one bag rather than have two separate bags one for the equipment and one for clothing. Don’t want to overpack and be miserable lugging all of my bags each place I go to.

Second since I plan on staying in shared rooms having to worry about storing my equipment and making sure no one is able to steal it or get there hands on it. I plan on locking it up but have also seen people post about a bag you can lock up and anchor to an immovable object in the room if there isn’t anywhere to store it in the hostel.


QUESTIONS:
If anyone has had any experience with traveling with camera equipment while staying in hostels what is your advice? Is it too much of a hassle to be moving from place to place with it? Anything you would do differently when traveling with gear?",solotravel,jturaoo2
Is it feasible to cross the U.S. by bus?,I just happen to be reading a book (On the Road by Jack Kerouac) where this trip is done (at least during some parts by bus) from East to West but it's a rather old book (here's [one of the routes the main character took](http://littourati.squarespace.com/storage/kerouac-files/kerouac_map.htm)) and I wondered: Maybe someone have done it already in r/solotravel!

Solo staycation in the UK ideas,"Hello,

I'm looking to decompress over a very stressful period at work and I have a week from 29th August - 5th September to do something; really what I want to do is grab some books, turn my phone off and head somewhere to camp and just relax on my own, maybe at one place for a couple of days and then another.

"Northern Italy in September, better to start in Milan or Venice?","Hi,

I have a week's holiday booked for mid September as my bosses have politely told me that I need a break and now that people are coming back from furlough I should take time off. 

I was thinking of heading to Italy as at the moment there are no quarantine restrictions to Italy from the UK and vice versa (I know this can change).

I've had a look at flights as I can get to Milan or Venice on the Saturday for £25 albeit Venice lands at 230 in the afternoon as opposed to 10am in Milan. 

I was thinking 2 nights in one of them, heading down to San Marino for 2 nights, Florence for 3 nights and then bologna for the final night as there is a flight home from there midday Sunday.

Has anyone ever done a similiar tour and what's a better city to visit out of Milan and Venice?

Any tips on best routes for solo female travelling in subsaharan Africa? Public transport advice?,"I am planning a 5 week trip next year (or later, post-covid) and would like to see 2-3 countries. I love seeing nature, experience music and local culture.

Travelling as a solo female I have questions about safety and about accessibility.
From my research the safest countries seem to be Tanzania, Uganda, Ruanda, Malawi, Zambia and Botsuana, Namibia maybe Ethiopia? Would love to hear experiences of others who have been there and some route suggestions or other destinations to consider. As I can't see all in one trip I'd either go for an eastern or a more southern route.

Namibia for example has stunning landscapes and wildlife but seems to only make sense with renting a car as a group of friends or go with a group tour, as it's apparently not possible to reach the destinations on public transport.


I looked into overland tours which seem quite affordable and worthwile considering the cost of renting a car or booking Safaris on your own. On the other hand I am more of an independent traveller and worry that their tight itinerary would stress me out and prevent me from hanging out with locals I meet and doing fun little detours. How hard or easy do you think it would be to do such a trip relying on public transport? I realize each country might differ, so I'd be grateful for advice on any.",solotravel,GretaPhoenix

Places you have visited and would not return?,"For me it is Cambodia, beautiful country but I had the worst time. The outright prostitution in Phnom Penh made me feel uncomfortable in ways I've never felt in Thailand. The girls looked so much younger, poorer and vulnerable than any of the girls I've seen in Thailand. 

I'm a woman in my 20s so was made to feel extremely unsafe by the men from europe, Russia, north America who were mostly overweight, balding and over 50. I had a feeling these were bad men who probably have come over for ease of access to sex with underage girls. They were criminals and made me feel sick and constantly scared. A few of them made comments towards me whilst I was alone, I could only understand the English ones but they were insulting. I feel so sorry for these poor Cambodian girls. 

I also travelled to Sihanoukville which was a dump, I only stayed a night as a jumping off place for the islands but that was more than enough. Same dodgy atmosphere men with underage Cambodian girls. Apparently this was a lovely beach town a few years back but nothing of the sort now. Litter everywhere, rabid dogs, shady characters, constant building, disgusting water. Had a quick walk then straight back to the hotel before I got mugged. 

The islands werent bad, had a much better time on Koh Rong and Koh Toch than I did on the mainland but imho there are beautiful islands all over SEA so I wouldnt see a reason to visit them again. 

Lastly Siem Reap, again dodgy characters, less so and more travellers but still the feeling of uncomfortable every time I see a white man with a tiny cambodian girl. Angkor wat was incredible, watching the sunrise over the temples was surreal and probably the highlight of my trip. However I've seen it now and dont think I'd need to see it again.

Solo travel has really become Solo travel,"I wanted to travel the world growing up, like most kids do to some extent. 5 years ago, when I first got the chance to start doing that regularly, I had no idea how to travel and meet people while traveling. That didn't stop me from booking solo trips to anywhere my passport would allow whenever I got Skiplagged notifications about flight price-drops. I'd visit places where I didn't speak the language, stay at budget hotels without any other travelers and especially travelers my age. I'd walk around foreign cities in places like Panama and Japan, knocking out places marked on google maps. I would go days without having real face-to-face conversations aside from the occasional google-translate assisted conversations with Uber drivers. These were exciting times because I was visiting places that I had only read about in history books and I was literally living my dreams. But being a very social person who thrives off meeting people and making new friends, it was also always a bit weird. Entire short trips felt like meditative experiences as I had a lot of time to spend with myself and my thoughts. I think they helped me grow tremendously as a person. Eventually, I found out about hostels/pub-crawls/free-walking tours/CS events and how easy it is to make friends with fellow travelers through any of those. And I never looked back. Traveling and backpacking became very social endeavors. Meeting people at the hostels and going out for a drink every night with fellow backpackers became a daily part of traveling. I am that guy that literally goes out every night when traveling, even if I cannot drink more than a beer because I have to wake up for a 6 am day-trip. In some ways I didn't grow as much from these trips, but this was just more fun and I had no intention of going back to the solo ways.

Now, the Pandemic has brought things back to how they used to be. I just came back from a 2 week trip through all the major Hawaiian islands, and this felt a lot like my first few trips to Central America. Sometimes I was the only guest at the hostel. I was driving around all day around the islands, almost always alone. It was surreal going to popular hikes and State National Parks and often being literally the only one there except for park rangers. At the same time it got lonely. Some days I would come back around sunset knowing I wouldn't meet another person till I visit a coffee shop the next morning. Just like the first trips, I had a lot of time to spend with my thoughts. I probably had more moments of deep reflection in the 5 days in Maui than I did in the 4 weeks in Stockholm last year. At the same time, I don't think I did anything as fun/euphoric as meeting a group of awesome French guys at a techno party in Zagreb and heading with them to Slovenia the next day. I guess ideally I would have a bit of both during my travels. I feel like I can't complain because traveling (even like this) is the most fun thing I can think of doing right now. I will absolutely keep doing it to the extent it's safe until this pandemic ends. It's still a great time. But I also have to say I can't wait for things to get back to how they used to be with packed hostels and late nights. Felt like these thoughts belong here and others may relate

EDIT: To anyone concerned about me not following Hawaii's quarantine restrictions for visitors, I live in Oahu. Inter-island travel was allowed and considered safe during my trip. State National parks have been open to the extent they can be while enforcing social distancing measures (all indoor buildings, visitor centers and certain hikes have remained closed). Even the cars I drove were picked up via non-contact methods with Turo where the keys were left in disinfected lock-boxes attached with the window.

Hi! Can someone tell me how the restrictions will be in April 2021? Also need help with daily budget. Thanks!,"/s

You can delete this, if this is isn't supposed to be here.

Lately, this has become really something nerve wrecking, people seem to assume this Sub can predict the future.

It became quite uncanny to scroll through new posts, basically only consisting of oracle-like questions and impossible help seeking.

I think it has affected this sub. I see less engaging overall and some of the better posts just disappear in the sheer amount of above said posts.

Furthermore, it is understandable to need help with budgetting or asking what it's like somewhere else. I mean, i guess that's what the sub is for.

Funnily enough, it seemed to become really common to avoid some info gathering before, google-ing and maybe even select a few countries to be more specific.

Is It Expensive Traveling With A Flexible Itinerary?,"I'm planning my first solo trip, hopefully, and optimistically sometime this summer, and I want this trip to be as open-ended and flexible as possible.  I've really taken to the concept of traveling with no concrete dates, in sort of a nomadic fashion, just staying in a city or country until I get bored and deciding a week or less out where I want to go next and when.  I've seen many posts here and follow many travel vlogers who travel like this and I've been inspired.

However, it seems to me that this style of travel would be much more expensive, particularly when booking flights on such short notice.  Am I wrong?  Is there a good strategy to save money on flights when traveling in this style?

To add more specifics, I'm planning on traveling to Turkey, and then from there, I would like to continue on to at least one or two more countries nearby in the Middle East or the Mediterranean.

Weak passport holders- how do you travel spontaneously?,"So I plan to travel once it is safe to travel. My idea initially was to take a break from my job and travel for 3 months backpacking across Europe. But seems like that plan will take a while due to the pandemic.

Central America: Where is the Turf to Surf?,"Hello all,

I have been brainstorming travel ideas as life begins to slowly crawl towards normalcy again, and have been dying to go on a trip. I have just received my first dose of the Pfizer vaccine (am an HCW) and am receiving my next dose in two weeks if it is worth mentioning. 

If possible, I'd like to plan this trip for early to mid May. My budget is ideally under $1500 for two weeks in a country in Central America. I also have $150 cashback bonus on my credit card that I plan on putting toward the cost of the flight. I am kind of a history geek as well, but am also interested in somewhere rich in hiking spots, with other activities available (allowing social distancing of course). I Imagine costs for the flight will amount to no more than $350 out of the total 1500. I have found several beachside AirBnbs in Nicaragua around $25 per night!

As for activities, the main thing on my list is finding the best beaches to surf on. I'm open to hiking, fishing, camping, swimming and the like. I live in the deep midwest, and have been a wage slave at my place of work since COVID - am needing to get away from that place for a bit. The language barrier doesn't mean much, I have a decent amount of traveling experience and know enough Spanish to get by. 

In what country can I get the most out of my money?Does 1500 seem like enough for a trip such as this? As the vaccines become distributed, will countries begin to adjust their policy regarding international travelers?

5 Things That have made Solo Travel more Enjoyable to Me after 30+ Countries - Looking for Other Viewpoints from Travellers,"1)	A phone with battery to last 2 days and MAPS.ME offline maps application. During my early solo travels, getting lost was always something that I was afraid of. Maybe I was hesitant on exploring a neighbourhood because I suspected I wouldn’t find my way back. Maybe I was hesitant to follow a road because it could turn out to be a waste of time. No more of that after I discovered that offline maps can minimise all these issues. You always know where you are and even if you get lost, you can easily find your way back. This made me feel much freer and more increased my eagerness to explore different places in a city.

2)	A good selection of eBooks pre-selected before the trip. Any trip has downtime, maybe a long queue, recovering from a heavy meal at a restaurant or just these few hours at the end of the day to relax. I find that it’s good for the mind to keep busy reading something during those hours. It could be a book related to the place of visit or about the history of the country. It could also be something completely unrelated like a Victorian novel or a non-fiction book about a subject of your interest. It doesn’t matter as long as it compels you to read and keeps your mind busy.

3)	Packing light and a good backpack. When I first arrive in a new location, I don’t want to feel the stress of having to find my accommodation right away because of heavy luggage concerns. For that reason I pack as light as possible with the assumption I must be able to carry the weight throughout the days on my back at all times. It makes my travels a lot more free-spirited. I can wander around the city all day and only go to the hostel/hotel late at night and then leave again early in the morning to maximise sightseeing time.

4)	Leaving flexibility in my plans and being okay with missing MUST-SEE places if they don’t personally interest me. This has greatly freed up my travelling days. My previous approach included listing down let’s say 5 places that the guidebook recommended and then visiting them, this left me feeling like I am doing hard work and sometimes the places themselves felt overrated or not worth seeing. My new approach to mitigate this is to just decide for myself what I want to see – Lonely Planet says a museum on local religious art is number one attraction – great, but I don’t care much for religious art so I will rather spend my 2 hours walking around a neighbourhood and taking photos and trying out local food.

5)	(Advanced-Only) Going in blind without doing any research and not booking any accommodation ahead of time. After being to 30+ countries, travel can start to feel routine. You go to city x, sightsee, sleep at hotel x, then go to city y, sightsee, sleep at hotel y. It’s all a bit predictable. I wanted to feel a sense of chaos and adventure, so I tried out this philosophy on a recent trip to Morocco. I did very little research, the only accommodation I booked was the first night after landing. Then when in Morocco, if I felt like staying an extra day, I could do so, if transport options to go to place x were not available, I simply went to place y, it made the entire trip much more relaxed and spontaneous. There were also more moments of surprise as I had done little research so it felt like exploring the unknown sometimes. The only thing to note here is that this approach can only be done in countries with lower tourist demand (such as South Morocco in early December) as otherwise the price penalty from not booking ahead would be significant.",solotravel,rw1337

This is an unfortunate reality. But it's worth asking yourself one thing. Is this really why you're going on a vacation? If it were your largest motivator, why would a donation not suffice? My favorite clubs are suffering right now too. And yet, it would not make sense for me to go clubbing. Nor would it be a charitable act.

**I am following all the rules**

I think we all agree that just because you can doesn't really mean you should. In many parts of the US, local regulations say you're able to go around without a mask. We know unequivocally that this is wrong. Despite it being allowed within the rules it puts everyone around you in harm's way.

**I'm taking all the necessary safety precautions**

For one, as we all know, a negative result is not a guarantee that you are COVID-free. This puts your flight attendants, pilots, airport/airline staff, taxi drivers, hospitality staff all at needless risk.

Two, the biggest safety precaution that our public health experts have advocated has been ""stay home"". You cannot be abiding by all the recommended safety precautions given that you've violated the biggest one.

**I will be fine even if I get sick**

I'm trying to foster an honest discussion. So honestly, chances are, yes. People on reddit tend to be younger and you'll likely make it out OK. But as people who love to travel, I have to imagine part of the reason why is because you genuinely love the different people and cultures of the world.

Show your compassion and love for these people now with your patience. They are excited for you to come back as much as you are to see them. But there is a time and place. And while it is not now, it will come soon.

--------------------------------------------------------

I know this has been a tremendously difficult experience. But normalcy is so close. A vaccine is within grasp and you will have it soon. Better yet, a vaccine will make your travel experiences exponentially better. And of course, the people and places you love around the world will be much safer too.

I know people can't stay inside their home indefinitely. You need to leave the house once in a while, if just for your sanity. Try local day trips that have minimal exposure to others. I've hiked this year more than I ever have in my life!

And at risk of sounding privileged, consider what a gift time can be. I have never had so much free time in my life before. I've started reading again. I've started playing my cello again after a decade away. I'm taking courses in statistics (for my career) and Spanish (for my future travels). My diet and exercise have never been better! While these luxuries are not something everyone obviously has access to, I imagine if you are considering travel/vacations right now these might be accessible to you too.

Ultimately, I'm a stranger on the Internet and the decision is yours alone. But I think it's important to be honest with oneself about your motivations before making a decision. I hope I've helped in some way to inform an honest assessment when you make your choice.",solotravel,blue_doki
When to travel and how to afford it?,"So I am a teenager who has been fortunate enough to be on my own solotrip once ... and I loved it! I am taking a gap year in two years and recently started saving to afford my plans and started planning it in more detail. But this made me wonder; how old were you guys when you started to travel and does it stop at a certain age? I am just afraid I wouldn’t get to experience many countries on my gap year except at the expense of experiencing countries in-depth. And if I dont experience many countries on my gap year, I am afraid I will never visit them in my life. Is this assumption some-What true? 

On the economic aspect, how do you afford travelling so much to so many countries and how do you budget for them?

Thanks in advance for your help!",solotravel,PossibilityPuzzled
"Ukraine - kiev, liev and Odessa","Hey guys :) im planning exploring Ukraine in the upcoming summer. I only stay at hostels but other than that I use quite some money on drinking (mostly beers, no fancy drinks) am eating out once or twice a day and gonna explore museums and Chernobyl for a day tour.

Use up all my hotel points and still meet people for my birthday trip to Central Europe?,"I've done plenty of solo traveling in the past, stayed at hostels, hotels, airbnb's, flown first class and taken obscure local trains. I also have really been into gathering hotel and airline points from credit cards the last 5 years, and using them mostly to fly better airline classes when the flight is over 8 hours long. I've only occasionally used hotel points, preferring to do bnbs and hostels when traveling solo to save money and meet people more.

But my 30th birthday is coming up this summer, so I booked a trip to Central Europe (Budapest, Vienna, and Prague), and I want to treat myself for this one. 
I have tons of points I could use for swanky hotels in these cities, but I feel I would miss out on meeting people, and end up feeling very alone during the trip. On the other hand, if I have the hotel points why not use them before they get devalued into oblivion and save the money for other stuff? 

Are there ways for me to meet people outside of hostels and guesthouses? Or could I drop into a nearby hostel anyway to meet people that way? I'm torn. I've checked out a few apps and they look pretty dodgy and not reliable enough to meet people through.",solotravel,philsworth
What do I do about this messy situation?,"Hey there,

So I'm sure I'll get shit on more than anything for this because of COVID so I'll preface that I:

* Am vaccinated
* Will wear a mask and face shield and use hand sanitizer 1,000 times
* Will be getting tested multiple times, and will not be ""doing tourist shit"" or interacting with the locals and will quarantine when I get there and when I get back.

**So my question is:**

I have a flight scheduled for January 23rd from Newark to Morocco (actually it's Alaska to Newark to Morocco but they are two separate bookings). My flights from NY&gt;MA and back were wicked cheap, about half the price of the next cheapest flight which should have been my first red flag. I booked with TAP Portugal and didn't really think anything of it.

Well, I mention my flight to someone on Facebook and they say ""oh no, TAP is horrible"". They had apparently canceled her flights **three times**(!) and refuse to issue a refund. Like basically it's a known scam airline that sells crazy cheap flights and then cancels 90% of them last-minute, never issuing any refunds. I looked online and saw dozens and dozens and dozens of extremely angry reviews.

So I called TAP Portugal customer service and... the number doesn't work. Like, the airline's number just doesn't work. I try several other numbers associated with the airline, none of them work. Expedia, which I used to buy the ticket, basically washed their hands of it. ""We can't call them if you can't"" kinda deal. Plus the airline set the cancellation fee at **$400-fucking-dollars**.

So I contact my bank to see if they can chargeback. They can't, because despite the ticket being purchased a week ago it still hasn't posted and they can't touch a charge until it's posted.

**So I'm wondering:**

* Does anyone have experience with international flights with TAP Portugal?
* Should I just go with the hopes that the flight will actually run, and run the risk of having it canceled last minute and being stranded in NYC?
* Buy another fucking ticket and eat the cost of the budget ticket, with the off-chance possibility that they might refund me?

Thank you!",solotravel,Katelyn89
Travel plans for France // Greater western EU trip: Looking for suggestions to and tips to get me started as a first time traveller,"I know this post is perhaps a bit more vague than the other ones here, but I don't have any precise plans for travel quite yet, just that I know after all this pandemic nonsense is said and done I *need* to get out of the country. I was specifically reserving 2020 for my ""fuck it, I'm going to travel the world"" year, and my new company gives me a month of vacation. So, might as well start planning now.

I know French and some German, and France has always been a destination I'd love to tour, but I need suggestions for good cities and sites to visit because it has just been difficult to wade through all the tourist-adevertisement laden stuff, I don't actually have that much interest in Paris, but would love to see and tour some of the lesser known chateaus and countryside towns. If you guys know of any particularly pretty hidden gems. If I have the time and money, I might do a bit of backpacking/touring more of France and western Europe in general, specifically I'd love to visit Berlin and Lisbon, I also have friends from my time volunteering scattered around Europe (London, Rome, Geneva, Solo). So, if there are generally any ""must sees"" or ""If you're going to visit X region, here's everything I would look into"". That'd be awesome!

Again, I know this is kinda vague and a lot, but as a first timer I'm not looking for an encyclopedia or everything to be spoon fed. Just some ""Hey, if you like X, these regions have nice stuff"". Because trying to get the big-picture stuff sifted from all the tourism-laden websites is... Difficult, and I'd like recommendations from other travelers :)",solotravel,Cendruex
"Will Covid-19 or the issue of ""over-tourism"" make you to rethink your plans?","Before Covid hit there were countless articles about over-tourism (too many tourists) in places like Paris, Rome, Prague, Barcelona, Venice, etc. Then Covid-19 hit and they went deserted. Have any of you changed your plans (or thought about changing your plans) to avoid contributing to the  problem in the future or maybe avoid crowds where you could more easily get an air-borne disease as crowds are returning? Does anyone live in a city/region that gets too many tourists?

My own city Sofia was becoming way too touristy in 2019 and many here have complained of it losing its authenticity. I quote a friend ""Hearing foreign speech is cool during the first 100 times, after that it makes you feel like the place has been infiltrated and hijacked"" (must be a subconscious thing from prehistoric tribalism lol). Most places where people have been friendly to me are either those where there aren't that many tourists/foreigners (genuine curiosity and interest) OR those that literally rely on tourist money to survive (not very genuine). Locals in cities that are big enough to survive even without foreign tourism are usually less accommodating/welcoming and couldn't care less. Anyone notice this pattern?

The pandemic showed that tourism is a very volatile sector and societies who rely only on it need to diversify. As for me, I've decided to travel to less popular parts of countries (Southeastern/Eastern Poland, Eastern Hungary, Puglia in Italy) and only stick to a few popular touristy places where I really love the place &amp; local culture, but visit them less often (Madeira, Krakow, Stockholm, etc.). And you?

Edit: 2nd and 3rd tier places in Europe worth checking imo: Bamberg, Erfurt, Eisenach/Wartburg, Visby/Gotland, Przemysl, Tarnow, Morskie Oko, Debrecen, Balaton lake, Ruse, Sliven, Yambol, Stara Zagora, Bari and Lecce.",solotravel,martinotbulgaria

Is there a list of hostels that have permanently closed this year?,"I've seen a little discussion about this on r/solotravel but not as much as I expected to. I’m curious about which hostels have closed permanently due to this year’s lack of travel (and how many have closed in general). I know there are a few threads about certain hostels that have closed, but I’m wondering if it would be possible to make a mega-list of hostels that have closed permanently so that people who have spent time there have a place online to pour one out for the places that meant something to them, or to just know that a place they used to love (or hate) has closed up shop. 

These are the ones I know of off the top of my head that have closed permanently. I can keep the list updated if the mods are cool with it:

\- Retox (Budapest) 

\- HI Hostel (Austin, TX, USA)

&amp;#x200B;

I think the aspect of solo travel I miss the most is staying at the kind of hostel that feels more like home than your actual home – the kind of place that you get stuck at for way too long because you can't bear to check out. I've been donating a bit on [AdoptAHostel](https://www.adoptahostel.com/), but I know that there are a lot of beloved hostels that aren't on there, and I'm not sure how much it helps in the face of such huge hostel income losses. Anyways, let me know if anyone has other confirmations about places that have closed permanently. I'll add them to the list above.",solotravel,akbanx
Difference in behavior traveling solo vs a group,"Since I haven't been able to travel much I was thinking about past trips, looking through old photos, etc.  I noticed that the trips where I traveled  solo I act completely different.  My experiences ended up being completely different even in places that were the same. It was consistent during domestic (US) and overseas trips. 

In groups I'm shy, I never meet any locals, I only spend time with friends, I don't do much site seeing.  It's generally just my girls and I hanging out in a different location.  I don't feel like I get much of a 'trip' out of it but I come back fresh and relaxed abd still look back on those trips as fulfilling.  

Solo I'm almost extroverted, I meet a ton of locals, go site seeing, do excursions, stay in dumpy hostels/airbnb's, turn on a Tinder account that just says ""Here on vacation"", go out more.  I generally look back on these trips as fulfilling as well and definitely more of an adventure, however I come back exhausted and almost needing a couple days to just chill.  

Both are great and I think I would want to continue both but it took a long break from travel to notice the differences.",solotravel,Street_archer_87
Transiting overnight through London on way to US. Can I go to hotel?,"So I'm flying from Finland to the US, transiting through LHR. 

Travel restrictions have messed everything up and I have an overnight layover (5PM to 10AM, so under 24h) in London.

Option 1: Suck it up, stay airside
Option 2: Pass customs, go to hotel, sleep.

No embassy website has super clear instructions for this scenario. Only that I may be required to take a Covid test if I pass customs (OK with me).

Sad that I won't be able to travel again," I have a feeling the COVID-19 pandemic will last at least two years just like the Spanish Flu (1918-1920), I'm guessing mid 2022. In January 2020, I booked a cheap roundtrip airline ticket from New York, New York to Miami, Florida for the end of March 2020. Then COVID-19 forced me to cancelled my ticket two days before departure. I was really looking forward to my trip. If I knew this was going to happen, I would've never bought a ticket in the first place. I'm kind of worried I won't be able to use my airline credit at all since the ticket was nonrefundable and it expires in December 2021, hopefully the airline will extend it. I would've continued my trip to Florida, but beaches and restaurants were closed at 5pm, city curfew at 10pm and Disney World was closed indefinitely, so there was no point of me going with all those restrictions. I have this feeling that I have to wait five years to start traveling again meaning no mask, no social distancing and no quarantine. I'm sick and tired of staying home all the time, not going anywhere at all while extremely bored. I rather be staring out of an airplane window, instead of my living room window looking at trees. This pandemic is making me waste my 20s away, the age range I'm suppose to enjoy (I turned 24 two days ago). Every time I look at the photos/videos of my first solo trip in May 2019 at the age of 22, I start to smile, wishing I can go back to 2019. Don't take life for granted as they say.

Atlas Obscura trips - any experience?,"While travel still seems like a bit of a pipe dream at the moment, I'm considering signing up for a group trip when it looks more realistic. I'm considering the standards (Contiki, TopDeck, G Adventures), but saw on an old Reddit post that Atlas Obscura actually [hosts group travel](https://www.atlasobscura.com/unusual-trips/all#2021%20trips).

Has anyone ever been on one of these trips? I'm intrigued by their offerings, especially the [space-themed Russia trip](https://atlasobscura.com/unusual-trips/moscow-soviet-space), which seems incredible (I'm really interested in space travel).

Disclaimer (based on other threads I've read where people have asked about organised group travel): I'm aware that these are expensive and it would be cheaper to organise myself; I'm very comfortable organising my own trips, just keen to give some group travel a go later in the year and these seem like very unique trips.",solotravel,eclipse--mints
"Anyone like traveling to places on the basis of ""who else do you know has gone to x""?","Something was pointed out to me by my family over the holidays(via Zoom). My travel plans have shifted in the year before the pandemic to look for stuff that aren't ""regular"" destinations in earnest.

 I have visited my share of more ""popular"" destinations (Paris, London etc.) and certainly enjoy them. I am not a person who degrades anyone for their choice of travel. I have a great aunt who spoke with me about wanting to go to Rome on her first international trip and said ""but that's just too boring for you"" and I reassured her that any place she wants to go is a good trip for her.

 I mention this because I was told that I have begun to look at places on the basis of the question ""do you know anyone who has traveled to x"" or ""who else do you know has gone to x.""  I was told that I am doing this just to shock people and gain credibility with other travelers as well as one-upping others. I had never thought of it like that, but I had mentioned that I would really like to see Iran and Saudi Arabia. These are two places that have intrigued me since I was young, but as a solo woman traveler, I never thought I'd get the chance. I have read more and more about them and it looks like they are potential options, but I have been told that I would only be doing it because it is uncommon(though probably not on this sub).

I was thinking about it and I guess that is part of the appeal of some places. I'd like to visit the Faroe Island and Svalbard. I'd love to do the Trans Siberian railway and Beijing to Lhasa one as well. These are all places that look cool but am I doing it just because it is less common? My family and friends do not believe that these are places that are actually on anyone's bucket list. They intrigued me for what they are but I can't deny that there is a part of me that thinks ""I will be going somewhere that no one I know would venture to."" It feels adventurous. I was the first person in my family to visit Japan(my first solo trip) and everyone had a meltdown(except my deceased father who accurately predicted that it would be the first of many journeys), and now, as much as I love Japan, it feels a little pedestrian. I'd love to go back, but to explore the more out of the way places.

Sorry, this was long and rabmly, but I am just thrown off a bit, feeling like perhaps my motives for travel are wrong?",solotravel,dezayek

Travelling in Covid as a SOLO teenage (19M) traveller: Poland – Slovakia - Hungary; August/September 2020,"We can all agree since the lockdown, life has taken an interesting route. Personally, my adventure to Switzerland were cancelled and a holiday to Berlin was put on hold. priorities began to focus on other areas of life and no longer being in and out the airports.

My last solo trip was back in January to Portugal, so I was ready for a trip. fortunately, I booked a cheap flight to Palermo and spent 3 nights there to fuel the spark and getting into the zone. March to July (4months) slowly passed and now its time to travel!

Finally made it to my hostel **Bubble Hostel (£5 a night)** after a budget friendly flight to the airport located 15k outside of the centre. When you first step foot outside any airport, the taxis are the first line of defence, but you got to ignore them and find a bus/metro or a train– in Krakow’s case, a bus was the option. Travelling solo allows you to listen to music so always have the freshest Spotify playlist prepared you’re your adventure.

Arriving from the UK were BoJo was doing his best impersonation of Vicky Pollard (Picture Daily mirror of this). You would expect the clubs and bar crawl to be closed... You are wrong! Whilst I was in Poland, I went on the same bar crawl 5 times! All nightclubs open until 5am and later. It seems to me that Covid must go to sleep at midnight.  Forget the new normal because I am now back in the normal. 1m floor signs and masks still to be worn in indoor spaces, Gyms fully open and no need to book. This was a blessing as gyms only reopened later on in the UK...and of course closed again

During my month in ‘Eastern’ Europe you allocentrics may call it - to me its Central Europe. It seemed very calm and controlled compared to the state in the UK. It continued like this for the whole month.

The flight situation was the there was no blocking of seats, however on all three flights I experienced, there was the luxury of a row to myself. The bus situation is that there are no blocking of seats and it seemed normal. The only thing what was different is that you have to wear a masks in both areas

Headphones in and listening to the varies songs and occasionally podcast – I ventured on the explore the main attractions of Krakow (Pictures). There are positives travelling in Covid, as the sites become quieter and as a tourist, it is an opportunity to appreciate the sites. On the other hand, less people on the bar crawls, but the locals did not disappoint.

When visiting a new country, it is always best to learn a few words to impress the locals whenever you’re in a bar and had too much to drink. I experienced many friendly people and never felt unsafe in Poland as everyone I met was very welcoming. In my first hostel, I met a few German lads who I had a chat to about the city they were from and my limited knowledge on to Bundesliga. Travelling around, I feel like football is a universal language (Especially being from Manchester) as people smile when you just mention a few players from their country or team.

3 days into Krakow, I reluctantly switched hostels to **Willa Retro Hostel (£9 a night)** as I enjoyed the free coffee/tea and breakfast offered by the Bubble Hostel. In the new hostels garden was a very chilled vibe with music and socializing taking place.A complete opposite to what lockdown offered in the months of April and May. At this point, my excitement levels jumped despite I had no plans on the coming month.

A few days later, I agreed on an itinerary exploring the southern areas of Poland. This include the cities of Katowice – Wroclaw – Lodz – Warsaw – Lublin – Zakopane (via Krakow). Spontaneously after a chat to a stranger at 4am in a Krakow nightclub I decided to go to Budapest BUT turns out I had to go before the 1st September as Hungary were closing their borders. I did not know this prior purchasing the Flixbus tickets from Krakow – Kosice (Slovakia) then Kosice – Budapest.

Sad to be leaving Krakow I ventured on to Katowice just for the night. I can’t say much about this city but around this time there were protest against the current government on their views on gay rights so I spectated a fairly peaceful protest in the city centre. **Hostel Sentral (£9 a night)** was seen as a bargain as I was one of two people in my dorm - another common theme

Few hours on the morning bus ride to Wroclaw was relaxing as there was no people around me. This was a regular theme throughout my trip. Travelling in Covid was a dream for exploring. Wroclaw was a lovely surprise due to it reminding me what Krakow was like with the beautiful architecture. Labelled as a university city, I did notice the student scene as the parks on the river were full of life with people drinking and just socializing. This was a completely different approach to the UK due to no more than 6 people meeting up. Still amazed that the gyms still open and the evening atmosphere in the centre still alive. You wouldn’t see a soul enjoying life in the major cities of the UK. I didn’t stay much in **Absynt Hostel (£6 a night)** as there were many areas to check out. (Pictures of stadium, centre and park) It had that big city feel which I wernt expecting but I can see this city picking up a reputation and I would recommend anyone to visit

On to the lesser known cities of Poland – Lodz. Another cheap and safe journey by Flixbus and I was greeted by the presence of nothing. A massive bus station filled with nothing. I don’t know if this is because of Covid or the bus station is too big for the city?

The same greeting, I had from the bus station was the same greeting I had when I entered my dorm at the **Cynamon Hostel (£8 a night)** Nothing. No one entered my room for the next 3 nights I was there, and I’m convinced there was no one else in the entire hostel. An entire hostel for £24 pounds for 3 nights. Royalty. Lodz isn’t too popular with tourist, but I’m surprised to see no domestic tourists. It was the weekend, so it gave me an opportunity to check out the nightlife. Over this weekend I watched the demolition Bayern Munich did to Barcelona.. watched on Bein sport with some guys from the Middle East. No English spoken it seems in these parts of Poland and so just ordering a simple drink was complicated. I laughed with the locals, whilst not understanding a word but the music was good!

Warsaw... second time in Warsaw for me after visiting with friends back in March 2019. One of my favourite buildings is located in this city (Palace of Cultural &amp; Science) but apart from that..eurgh. When travelling, I think when you travel to the capital, it does not represent the country, so travelling to the second cities to countries it gives a fairer review of a country. One of the many few positives Warsaw holds is that there’s an impressive beach where you can chill! **City View Lucka Hostel (£5 a night).** Not the best hostel but I was bound to encounter a negative hostel experience especially when hopping from hostel to hostel. Moving on..

Travelling again with Flixbus to the next city on the eastern side of Poland which is Lublin. Prior to coming to this surprisingly close-knit town, I didn’t do any research as I wanted to be surprised.. and I was! A standard old town filled with the coloured buildings and hosting an impressive castle casting over the town. I would recommend this place and recommend the hostel as well **Folk Hostel (£8 a night).** Finally I weren’t alone in a dorm, as I got talking to a few of the tourist. Just by luck a Hungarian girl was staying in the dorm as I ended up getting her contacts as I planned to visit Budapest. Also, a hostel first for me was that a dog was staying in the room, was a very cute dog and caused no problem aww. The main attraction in this town is the Concentration Camp located on the outskirts of the city. Vast area with a handful of people in the grounds. Highly recommended if your interested in the history of the surroundings.

Flixbus again of course back to where it all started. How much has Krakow changed with Covid restrictions since I was last there a few weeks ago? Turns out, not much as I met up with the bar crawl lads and seshed to 6am with varies nationalities including France, Netherlands and even the UK.  As a solo traveller it is a great way to meet people and connect with as when you’ve had a drink you would make friends with anybody. In and out of hostels It is always good to splash out (not too much) on an apartment for a few days to recharge the batteries. A dumb move by me was the book an apartment by the train station - **JM Rooms Lubicz 10 (£15 a night)** .. wonder why it was so cheap!

Afternoon bus to the hidden beauty of Zakopane. Only 3 hours from Krakow and I highly recommend visiting if you ever get the opportunity. I expect it to be packed because of the many walking routes you can do in summer, in contrast to the skiing in winter. I really did get that Austrian mountains vibe but with such cheap prices. One to visit again in the future, unreal views UNREAL. **Willa Mavi (£13 a night)** topped it for me as I decide to stay in apartment with views of the mountains. BONUS: it had a bathtub! When you visit the bordering regions of Poland/Slovakia, you got to check out the ‘Morskio Oko’. Even in these Covid times, get to the bus station early to beat the crowds because you would like the lake for yourself.

A completely different side of Poland I thought id never encounter with the fresh air and amazing views. I returned to Krakow feeling content knowing it was the weekend, so I had to go on a bar crawl on my last night of Krakow. I sure did that and stayed out until 6… No 10pm pubs shutting here but hey ho, you people in the UK had 50% off food.

Next day was off to a new place in a new country – Kosice, Slovakia. Was a lengthy bus journey and no trouble crossing the border. I thought because of Covid there would be trouble but no there was no problem whatsoever but could I leave Slovakia and enter Hungary... who knows lets risk it.

It’s a shame for Slovakia because it is positioned in between their well-known neighbours of Poland &amp; Hungary. I personally not too interested in the country and yes I have been to the capital - Bratislava last year (not solo).

My mind was just thinking about if I can enter Hungary, but I would have to take a overnight train to Ruzemberok then a bus down to Budapest. Thankfully, no issues on crossing the borders. The date was 31/08/2020 so one day just before the borders close. From the bus station to the hostel was just an easy metro ride to the centre. It really is not hard to direct your way around the major cities of Europe just follow the maps on offer and use google maps. The metro to the centre was a quick ride and I was soon ready to check in…but it was 7am. Most hostels/hostels accept check ins at 2pm so knowing this I booked the night before and with hope I could sleep the morning away in Budapest. Long story short that was not possible. After chatting to an Italian girl about her city Torino, who was working in the **Hostel One Basilica (£5 a night)** I explored the attractions such as the Parliament Building, Chain Bridge and many more.  The busiest attraction would be the Széchenyi Thermal Bath, but we are in a global pandemic.

The nightlife in Budapest did not disappoint despites it was Covid. Luckily my hostel was full of outgoing people who worked in the hostel and knew the best places to party. A tip for any student travelling is to research the citys Erasmus page and check if there are any events. This is because the beer tends to be cheaper!!! I was successful in my search for an Erasmus night. The entry was cheap, and the drinks were cheap but of course they were because Budapest is cheap!! So many people in these Covid times into a strange nightclub with many corridors to apply. Just a few hours ago I was talking to my mates how we miss a normal night out..oops. Further few nights were spent in the capital and I met up with the same girl from Lublin. She showed me around the city, and we talk about many different topics.

First time Solo-Travel to Peru (Aiming for 14-21 days) Any Input is appreciated!!!,"Hello Everyone! So context, I am a medical student and we get 1 full month off in our third year. During this time I want to take a trip to Peru and I would like to stay for 2-3 weeks. I wanted to hear anyones advice and input on my Itinerary! I am concerned about altitude sickness, so I will be bringing Azetazolamide when the time is right, and also I planned the trip based on ascending altitude. I had COVID and will be donating my plasma to help pay for this. I am guessing I would need around $2,500 but I could be significantly off. Here is what I was thinking, is this totally unrealistic? Any input is appreciated!!

Do you collect anything uniquely meaningful to you when you travel?,"I have a shoebox full of mementos from the time I lived in Europe - city maps, wristbands, concert tickets, restaurant menus, drink coasters, notes from friends, newspaper clippings, you name it. 

I was a *very* broke university student, so I couldn’t afford many meaningful souvenirs. I had to skip out on a lot of paid museums and restaurants for the same reason. Almost all of my money went toward Flixbus or budget Ryanair flights, spontaneous hostel reservations, and quick stops at grocery stores for beer and whatever cheap groceries I found affordable enough to hold me over for my time there (usually bread, a protein, and my fair share of greasy street food).

I may not have gotten the most in-depth cultural experience in each country, but it was a uniquely humble method of diving in and adapting to each new place. I’m not from a wealthy family whatsoever, so the worldly thinking I developed was life changing. The memories I made were well worth the struggles. I keep telling myself I’ll go back to some of my favorites someday - I think now I can afford a few €15 meals :) 

I’m doing better for myself now, much less vagabond but trying to keep up my share of unique travels. Feeling deprived (thanks COVID), I pulled my box from the back of a shelf for the first time in about 3 years and was understandably hit with a massive wave of nostalgia. Sure, it’s just a box of scraps, but to me it’s tangible proof that this weird, recurring dream I hold so dearly in the back of my mind was once reality. It’s a tiny reminder of the sweet, sweet freedom I once felt as a student, holding these same maps in these same hands as I happily navigated myself through new worlds with pure, bare-boned happiness. I realized I’ll never be able to share these feelings and bits of memories with anyone but myself but that’s what makes the old shoebox so beautiful.

"Anyone have experience driving from the US to Monterrey, Mexico?","I have a three-month furlough coming up this summer and I'd like to to something fun. Last time I had a furlough, I went to Peru for a month. This time I'm thinking of an extended stay in Mexico, specifically Monterrey. I live in New Mexico, and would cross with my own car, as I would like to bring my two dogs with me. I'm interested in probably renting an AirBnB for a month or so and just exploring that city/area and improving my Spanish. I'm a solo woman traveler and I'm already fluent in Spanish. I've been to Mexico a number of times including studying in Mazatlan and a two week solo trip to Oaxaca and Puebla in 2018. All the same, I've never drove my own vehicle in a foreign country. Is the road from Laredo to Monterey safe? Is there anything I should know about driving in that part of Mexico? I live in New Mexico but specifically chose the Laredo route, as it would require the least solo driving in Mexico. I know I have to purchase insurance when I cross, but I don't know any specifics of that. I'm honestly also interested in getting all the way down to Mexico City and seeing Guanajato and San Luis Potosi on the way, but that seems quite overwhelming to me. Any thoughts on going that far south by car as well?

My work requires me to plan my vacations until mid January - but this year?,"I get thirty holidays and I've ""saved"" up five days worth of overtime from last year. Usually I do three weeks in April and three weeks in November. As things are going I won't be able to do a trip in April this time of course. Access to the vaccine is relatively unclear at this point, though it seems likely that here in Germany you will be able to get a vaccine as a healthy person in summer. To be safe I was thinking about putting in three weeks in late November/early December. But what to do with the rest? I'm afraid of planning - let's say three weeks in June and then losing out because of bad luck. That's why I'm then considering to spread it out a bit with shorter trips. Current plan looks like this: 

- July: 2 weeks in Spain (or somewhere else in Europe)

- September: 2 weeks in the US (or someplace else with a large amount of vaccinated people)

- December: 3 weeks in Mexico 

Do you think this is realistic or should I spread it out further with smaller trips? Problem is the more trips you take the more money you spend and only being at work for 3/4 weeks for half of the year sounds like it'd break up my workflow too much.",solotravel,No_Contact_3998

How much money would I realistically need to travel continuously for 3-6 months?,"I am a 21 year old located in Australia. Initially I was very career-driven but now I am starting to realise that COVID aside, I may never be in a better position to travel than I am now.

I am currently on a $63k salary with about $10k in savings. I would like to quit my job this/next year (depending on the COVID situation) and travel for a few months before getting another job. I am single and live pretty cheaply, so I envisage my savings increasing over the next few months.

I have an undergraduate law degree and about 4 years of work experience behind me, so i feel fairly confident that I wouldn’t be rendered unemployable by an extended travel period.

I realise that living costs vary but I am not fussy on travel locations - I just like to see new places. Would I be able to support myself on $20k in a foreign country, or do solo travellers pick up odd jobs along the way?

Australia Working Holiday!... or Not. Having Problems with Anxiety and Solo Travelling.,"Hi all. I’m hoping to go on a 417 Australian Working Holiday in January 2022 (assuming that boarders are open, and things are relatively back to ‘normal’) and so, looking for some advice. 

I’ve really dreamt of this trip for the last 2 - 3 years, researched and planned in depth, and used it as motivation to get to the end of uni (it would be a post-graduate travel gap year). At some points, it’s been all I could think about; the sun on my skin, seeing the Blue Mountains, taking a surf lesson, sailing the Whitsundays... However, now that it’s becoming ‘real’ and I’m getting closer to having to make actual decisions e.g applying for a visa and booking flights, I’m getting a bit nervous. I’m a fairly reserved and introverted person with, to be honest, a fair amount of general and social anxiety. I’ve lived by myself, a few hours from home, for the last year, and have traveled both locally and abroad many times before - with friends and family. Here, on holidays, I usually love every minute, largely the ‘doing’ element; the activities, the sights and experiences etc. but I’ve not travelled by myself before, let alone stayed in a hostel, and now, am questioning whether I can follow through with what I would love to do vs. what I’m capable of doing. A few family members, who I’m sure mean well, have basically told me not to go, due to my quietness and / or because of going by myself (I don’t know any friends or family who are either not in uni or work, or who are financially stable enough etc.), whilst my best friend encourages me to go for it.

So, any tips / experiences / suggestions for:
- Solo travelling for the first time (for females, in particular). 
- Anxiety and travelling. 
- Solo travelling / anxiety whilst on an Australian Working Holiday. 

(Please try to be constructive, not criticising.)

Happy New Year (and Decade!),"Hey folks! 

It’s been an interesting year to say the least haha - and I’m looking forward to being able to (solo) travel again :)

An interesting experience with solo travel - last year I traveled by myself to Quebec City for New Years (and I’ve done solo New Years another time in Montreal) and had a lot of fun with folks I met there!

Today as I’m wishing people a Happy New Year, besides my family, funny enough the group that we formed last year (also on WhatsApp) for New Years feels more like the group of people I’d love to spend another New Year’s Eve with!

There’s something quite fascinating about the relationships you make when you solo travel - neither of you expect much from the people long term - but for the time y’all are together, it does feel like a great community :)

Travel Insurance,"Bit of a confession here, some of you will probably think its stupid of me but I havent really bought travel insurance for most of my trips, especially for the two 'multi countries' trips. Thankfully nothing happened to me for them, e.g. ended up in the hospital/lost some valuables etc.

Obviously, this is bad but has anyone else just go ahead and travel without them, and to those who gets travel insurance like normal people, which one do you suggest on getting (UK based if that helps). Reasons I dont get it is because, either I get really excited and forget about it or just see it as another expense I could get away without. But I know if shit hits then fan, it will cost me much more than getting one in the first place.

To those who have claimed, what happened and how does the process go, e.g. losing an item on a trip. I plan to take just one rucksack for my next trip in the near future hopefully and that would mean putting a camera along with my other things - maybe insurance would help just in case I end up losing/forgetting stuff while packing on the go.",solotravel,parttimebackpacker

Getting robbed and losing visa advice/experiences,"I’m trying to understand what people do in the case of getting robbed when moving between locations — ie where you haven’t been able to stow your passport and backup cash and card at a hotel/hostel.

I know you need to make your way to an embassy, but how do you do that with no money or identification?

Question(s) about WHV in Oz/ NZ,"I plan to apply for one of these in early 2022 so I can have a longer-term, sustained travel through Oceania without cutting too deep into my nest egg for further SEA/ steppe solo travel afterwards. 

I know that the visa is predicated on having short-term, non-career based jobs during the stint. My question is, besides seasonal/farmhand, what is actually allowed by this, and how is the legality determined? 

I have a few years of experience as a semi-nomadic engineer in mechanical, structural, and manufacturing environments. Would something like a term-limited contract job in this field be allowed? Either something like a graduate-level apprenticeship, lab/manu technician, or construction job in structures/hvac besides unskilled labor? I understand the availability of them is nigh-unpredictable, I’m more so curious if it’s even legally pursuable. 

Also, it seems like completion of a WHV has no impact on future long-term visa acceptance. Is this correct? I ask because I’m fairly certain to relocate from USA to either NZ or Germany permanently after 10-15 years of a semi nomadic living, and having completed my degree in Germany I have an advantage there. Would a year of life/work in NZ have no impact at all on future consideration?

Australian Visa,"I cant find a proper group for this question, but I need help!

While I was there I met my boyfriend and have since decided to move to Perth to go be with him. I know right now with covid we will be waiting for a bit and trust me I'm well aware of that whole situation. My question is this: Can I apply for the second Working holiday visa, or is there a time frame I missed? I heard that I may not be ablate enter for another 3 years? Or if there is an option to reapply for the first working holiday? When I go next I want to be there for a year and hopefully apply for a partner visa while I'm there, not yet though. I'm just confused as to what visa would work! I've looked everywhere. Thanks!

Just wanted to add some information after reading some comments. I'm currently 20 years old. I didn't do any of the needed work in order to qualify for a second working holiday. I arrived May 2019 and left August 2019, therefore my visa was good until around May 2020. So it has since then expired. My hope was being able to possibly reapply for the first one and then do the work, but I no longer think this is the case though it would be easier. I'm looking at partner visas but they're very expensive and take a while to process. I'm still waiting to see on if anything changes with their international travel ban, but if not I'm going to start applying for an exemption in February. ",solotravel,mrworldwidesupersize
Getting COVID in a foreign country while traveling,"Question for those still solo traveling during the pandemic.

Has anyone gotten COVID while in a foreign country? I don’t plan to travel until the vaccine, but I’m really curious how people are handling this.

Obviously it would be very unethical to move about  once you have symptoms, so what do you do? 

Cancel all forward (or return) travel until you clear a PCR 2-3 weeks later? Tell the hotel you are sick and can’t leave if you are supposed to check out?

If you are hostel bound, I wonder if they would just kick you out. Where do you go from there?! Seems inappropriate to check in to a new hotel or AirBnb once you are sick. 
And, depending on the country, how do you get food in a safe manner? It all seems quite risky, especially if you don’t speak the language.

"18 y/o, First Time Solo Travel to Latin America, Advice Needed","Hi guys,
Assuming coronavirus is sufficiently contained by 2021 summer*, I was hoping to go solo travelling. I am European and will have finished my final exams. Usually people after these exams go travelling with friends around Europe, however, I wanted to do something different. It's not that I have no friends to travel with, more that the last few years and my childhood in general have been difficult, and I feel like I am starting a new chapter in my life. As cheesy as it sounds, I am dying for some alone time somewhere foreign, where I can engage my love of travel and learning, as well as taking time for introspection and learning more about myself. I would aim to spend about one month or one month and a half travelling - much more than I could in Europe, given that Latin America is cheaper from what I understand.

Latin America has always fascinated me, which is why I really want to visit. Not only the culture, but also its history and its current interesting socio-economic situation, with countries like Mexico and Brazil straddling middle-income status, next to more developed nations like Chile and Uruguay. I am fairly fluent in Spanish (approx. C1 level), and am learning Portuguese.

I should mention right off the bat that I'm a city guy: I like buildings, I like museums, architecture, learning about the history and socio-economic and political situation of different places around the world. That said, I can and do appreciate nature when I get the chance; I'm just not the type to go hiking and trekking, more the type to sit and admire the scenery.
With that all said, I have a few questions:

What is the ideal itinerary? I had a few different ones in mind:
(-&gt; is by bus, =&gt; is by air)

Belo Horizonte -&gt; Sao Paulo -&gt; Curitiba -&gt; Iguazu Falls -&gt; Buenos Aires -&gt; Santiago =&gt; Lima &amp; Cusco OR Bogota

or

Buenos Aires =&gt; Ushuaia =&gt; Buenos Aires -&gt; Mendoza -&gt; Santiago =&gt; Lima, Cusco OR Bogota

or some combination of the two. 

Other cities of interest are Florianopolis, Porto Alegre and Asunción. Nothing is concrete yet, I'm really just playing around with ideas right now. From what I understand, many of the nature parks in South Brazil aren't accessible by public transport, which is why I haven't considered them.

2) As a first time (male) solo-traveler, is visiting Latin America - Brazil in particular - a good idea?
I am well aware that there are crime problems in Brazil. Although most of the dangerous cities appear to be in the North East, where I don't plan on going, I have still heard bad things about Sao Paulo, and even worse things about Rio, which is why I haven't even considered Rio for travel at all, and am cautious about considering Porto Alegre (please do tell me if this is silly or not). I have never had a gun pulled on me, or been the victim of violent crime; the only ""robbery"" I have experienced are street muggings by unarmed people when I was younger.

However, I should also mention that my family is of Indian origin; my family in India, who I regularly visit, live in a fairly poor/deprived part of Delhi, so I'm not unfamiliar with the discomforts of travelling in less developed regions. I have visited Chicago, Washington D.C., and the outskirts of Detroit, if that makes a difference.

I am also fortunate enough to be fairly well travelled with my family; we tend to do budget city breaks when we travel in Europe, which entails using lots of public transit, and sometimes staying in slightly shadier parts of town.

With all this mind, am I too ""inexperienced"" to go to Brazil (and/or Colombia)? What about Buenos Aires, Patagonia and Santiago?

Help finalizing my Mexico Itinerary,"Really hoping this post doesn't get flagged since I'm not sure how descriptive I will get.

This is my first international solo trip!

I am 95% complete with booking my accommodations for this trip and have one MAJOR portion that I need some suggestions for so I can do it best.

&amp;#x200B;

I have one major gap in my itinerary and I want to know the best way to use it.

&amp;#x200B;

Do I \_\_\_?

A) Go to Valladolid for 1 night

B) Add a 3rd night to Tulum

C) Add a 3rd night to Bacalar

&amp;#x200B;

I’m super interested in Valladolid for some of the Cenotes and like the idea of seeing an old Colonial city. 

If Valladolid is suggested I can flip the dates and go to Valladolid and then Tulum to cut back on driving distances. It seems I would be back tracking to go from Tulum to Valladolid to then go to Bacalar. Bacalar is over an hour closer from Tulum.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my current list of locations im going to.

Arriving in Cancun and going directly to Isla Mujeres.

5/8-5/10 Isla Mujeres (2 nights)

5/10-5/12 Tulum (2 nights)

5/12-5/13 ????????????????

5/13-5/15- Bacalar (2 nights)

5/15-5/16 Cancun and fly home

&amp;#x200B;

I appreciate any help with this! I'm truly unsure of how I should do it. Im very interested in Valladolid but worried if it is going to be too hectic for 1 night and I should just stay somewhere else an additional night. THANK YOU!

How to financially sustain yourself during long term traveling?,"I went on a date a few months ago with someone who had spent 3 years of his life just freely traveling the entire world. It's something I've always dreamed of doing and I want to get plans underway, but something I didn't get to ask him (and can't now because he ghosted me) was, how does one sustain themselves financially while traveling for 3 years? My best guess would be he must've picked up odd jobs along the way, but I don't even know how one goes about finding odd jobs to pick up. Do you just ask around? How do you distinguish a financial opportunity from a labor trafficking trap? Hopefully this doesn't sound too naïve, I genuinely want to learn how this works and have nobody in my life to ask. For context, I'm female, American, in my mid-20's, white, and have very limited language expertise (but am working on learning secondary languages). If anyone has any advice or resources to help me learn more about this, it would be greatly appreciated!

"19F Solo trip to Colombia, should I skip Bogotá?","Hi. Sorry if I formatted this wrong, I do not use reddit much.

I am 19F here and planning my first solo international trip to Colombia in 2021 (if covid allows). I am student with over $6000 USD in savings that I want to travel with and since school is online, I can study anywhere I want and I feel like this is best time in my life to travel because of that despite my family telling me I will make it back in a body bag. So, I was planning on spending most of my time,2-3 weeks in Cartagena since I enjoy the beach more than anything. But I have heard Santa Marta is better so that is not set in stone. I also am planning at least 5 days in Medellin and same with Cali. I have heard some bad stories about Bogotá and am wondering if it worth planning some days there??? 

I am planning on using air bnbs. I know a lot of solo travelers use hostels but I like my privacy. I am not looking to party much. I do not know much Spanish though, I have been studying on and off for about a year along with some classes at my college but would only consider myself to be conversational. 

My questions:
- Is Bogotá worth spending a few nights in?
- Is Colombia relatively safe for young solo female? I am not sure how well I will blend in as I am a tall pale redhead. But I know not to go out at night, hide my valuables, same precautions I take in any big city alone. 
- Is there any must see attractions in Colombia?
- It looks like you can take overnight buses in between the bigger cities but it is just better to pay for a flight in between?? 

Any and all advice will be greatly appreciated as I have never done anything like this and my family is not very supportive.",solotravel,Practical-Bread7709
Travelling from Canada to Barcelona for Medical Reasons,"Hello,

I am planning visit Barcelona to obtain medical imaging this January. I have been in contract with a neurosurgeon's office who informed me that I am able to skip quarantining upon arrival as the trip is for a medical appointment.

However, I was reading into the Government of Canada website that details the travel restrictions that says the following ""Travelers arriving from Canada are not allowed entry to Spain. However, certain travelers may be allowed entry if they can prove the essential nature of their travel or if they meet specific criteria.""

However the link to the specific criteria doesn't details what falls under ""essential nature"". I was wondering if the trip is for medical reasons and I have documentation showing I am going to visit a neurosurgeon would I be allowed entry to Barcelona.

Additionally, as I am 21 and unfamiliar with international travel and Barcelona I was wondering if I would additionally be allowed to bring a friend to accompany me on my trip.

List of questions:

1) What are the procedures before I travel to Spain

2) Would I be allowed entry for medical purposes

3) Can I bring a friend to accompany me, and would he or she also be allowed to skip quarantine

3) Do i need pre flight covid tests/ and testing when I land

Any other additional information would be extremely helpful as I am having a hard time finding the proper listing of esstential services and any other procedures I would have to follow.

Spanish Immersion Program + hiking trails,"TL;DR: Planning to travel in June'21 or when the world opens up. Looking for a place where I can learn Spanish and have easy access to trail running and hiking.

&amp;#x200B;

Hello all, I've saved enough to take a 6-8 month break from work and not be worried about it. I was planning to travel in June or whenever the world is safe for travel again (whatever comes later). I don't need to hit up too many places but am content with staying longer in a few locations, focusing on my well being and getting immersed in the local culture.

Three things I did want to do are:

1. Learn Spanish (current proficiency: Basic)
2. Photography (current proficiency: Intermediate)
3. Hiking and trail running (current proficiency: Intermediate +)

I wanted your advice/experience on places where I could be part of some Spanish immersion program and have easy and safe access to some great outdoors. (Safe =  where I could hit the trails almost every day without worrying about having a guide or a group accompany me)

Below are a few places I've been to before and would love to return and stay longer, but unsure of the Spanish programs there. Would love feedback on them or any other similar places you'd recommend:

* Peru: Huaraz or Cusco (loved Huaraz!)
* Argentina: Bariloche (though it'll be winter in June/July)
* Spain: San Sebastian (passed through it on a hike and loved the town) or Mallorca
* Guatemala: Antigua or Lake Atitlan (loved it but was always told not to venture far without company)

I've heard great things about Colombia, Bolivia and Ecuador but have not been yet. Not a high roller but pretty open on budget.

Should I check in a luggage for my backpacking trip? Is it possible to travel with a 8 kg backpack for my whole trip?,"I plan on doing a backpacking trip across Turkey and potentially parts of the Soviet Union this May. 

My itinerary is

1. Fly from US to Turkey via Paris on Air France. Free 23 kg check in baggage
2. Travel around Turkey using Turkish Airlines, trains, busses, or Skyexpress airlines. All airlines allow free check in baggage 
3. (If all countries lift Covid rules by then): Public transport or Train from Turkey to Georgia. Then Georgia onto Yerevan, Armenia. I will skip this section if countries still have covid rules.
4. Fly from either Turkey or Armenia to Kyiv, Ukraine. Airline will be either Ukraine International or Skyup. 23kg checked baggage will cost $15-$25
5. If the EU allows US travelers by then. Fly from Kyiv to Warsaw Poland on Skyup. Checking in will cost $13 (which is 50% of the cost of the flight). Then fly from Warsaw to Chicago on Tap Portugal. This will cost me an extra $50 vs purchasing the Tap Discount fare. 

So basically, I will be paying an extra $80 ish to bring in a checked in suitcase on board all my flights. I'm just not sure if I can bring 3-4 weeks worth of stuff in a backpack.

Crazy hostel experiences,"So, I'm not solo travelling (I'm backpacking with my boyfriend) but I thought this would be the best place to share my crazy experience. 

Moved into a hostel about 2 days ago, due to start working for accommodation on Saturday for hostel, so currently still paying. The room i've moved into is next to a noisy room, where people want to stay up late, have their friends in the room til late playing music, banging door to get in. It's annoying.

So after the second night of this happening, wakes me up at 1:30am (i've got work all day for a client so not good) - I knock the door ask them to turn music down, ignored. Knock again, finally stops. 

The next morning, I realise the noisy person is also the night manager and the cleaner, who angrily barks at people who don't clean up after themselves. So instead of going straight to reception to complain, I decide to speak with my new colleague now she is sober, and it's morning to ask her to go downstairs next time she hosts a party because we're neighbours. She goes crazy. Mental. Before I know it, she's cornering me in the bathroom threatening to punch me in the face. I can't move, she's actually physically blocked me with the steam cleaner. I keep my cool, stand my ground, until a girl brushing her teeth breaks it up. But she's not finished with me, she returns seconds later, telling me how she's going to shove my head in the toilet. At this point - I go to the manager, who is already coming out to see what the racket is all about. But the girls following me down the corridor, telling me about how she can't wait to put my head in shit. 

An hour later, she is removed from the hostel and ever since she has been wandering the street, walking around the block for a good solid 6 hours.

Pre travel anxiety,"I am 20 yo and for the last 5 years I've had crazy pre-travel anxiety and I really need some help because all the posts I have seen it is almost always about things you can write down and get over with.

For example I have to travel today by train (4 hour trip) to get to my home city for Christmas and even though I have done this trip many times, I still feel very anxious before the trip. These past years I have been basically living with it and not really caring about it, I just know I am going to get anxiety and I just try to go with it and feel bad for the rest of the trip. I have gotten to the point where I vomit because of my anxiety especially when it is at its peak, minutes before the trip begins, ruining my day both emotionally and physically. Also I have to say that I really like traveling and visiting new or old places and different countries but I have to deal with this anxiety. What I mostly feel is stomach ache, nausea, short breathing, dry mouth. Generally sick.

"Trip Report: Russian Federation, September / October 2020","Hey brothers and sisters!

After making a lot of research I took the chance and visited Russia for 30 days in September and October 2020. Russia was always a dream destination for me and I was happy that I could still pull it off this year, despite all the obstacles that Corona put upon us.

**Disclaimer:** I am aware that I visited Russia as a foreign citizen for recreational, touristic purposes during a global pandemic. I hereby declare that everyone willing to travel should do his/her careful research about travelling in this era and what the the possible consequences of such a trip are. I therefore am not endorsing nor discouraging anyone from doing a trip nowadays - I'm just saying that you should do your careful research first.

**Background:** 29M Swiss, mostly have adventurous backpacking experience in Asia. Very interested in Russian / former Soviet culture and history. I can read Cyrillic and have some very basic Duolingo Russian skills, but apart from that I can't understand sh** and are pretty bad at everything. The trip took place between September and October 2020, right before the Corona numbers again went off the roof. 

**Budget:** About USD 50 per day, not including airfare or visa fees etc. Because of the current global situation the highest expenditure was the flight Zurich-Moscow and back, which only operated twice a week. But because my flight options were pretty limited I swallowed this bitter pill and did it.

**Length of Travel:** 30 days

**Destinations (not including daytrips):** Saint Petersburg, Petrozavodsk, Moscow, Volgograd, Simferopol, Sevastopol, Yalta, Vladikavkaz, Grozny, Erzi (Southern Ingushetia)

**Accommodations:** Either cheap hotels (found via HotelsCombined or Agoda) or at friends' or at guides' homes.

**Arrival:** The Corona pandemic makes planning an international trip obviously much more difficult than normally. While getting the 30 days visa was not a problem (only citizens from Switzerland, UK or Turkey could obtain tourist visas at that time), I also had to get a negative PCR test result 72 hours prior to my flight (in English or Russian language). This already set me back quite some money and time. At the airport in Switzerland my test result was checked very carefully by the departure staff and arriving in Moscow Domodedovo the Russian officials again checked the result along with my current body temperature. The procedures at immigration and security didn't take too long though (about 1.5 hours) since there were almost no travelling tourists but only returning Russian citizens. Many people were quite amazed to see a foreigner traveling at that time. Immediately after getting my backpack from the baggage claim I headed to the domestic check-in counters and took a domestic flight to Saint Petersburg, which also worked flawlessly.

**Activities:**

* Visiting the many landmarks in Saint Petersburg, such as Peter &amp; Paul, Artillery Museum, Peterhof or Kronstadt
* Visiting Kizhi Island and renting a car to visit other landmarks in Karelia (such as Ruskeala)
* Visiting Moscow and its many landmarks, such as Red Square, Kremlin, Bunker 42, Federation Tower or Monino Aircraft Museum
* Visiting Suzdal (Golden Ring) and its many churches and monasteries
* Visiting Volgograd and its landmarks such as Rossoshka Cemetary, Square of the Fallen Fighters, the war museums, Mamayev Kurgan
* Visiting the Southern part of Crimea, such as Simferopol, Sevastopol, Yalta and Bakhchysarai. Lots of daytrips such as to Artillery Bay, Crimean War panorama, Chersonesus ruins, Maxim Gorky fortress, Submarine base in Balaclava, Cape Fiolent, Ai Petri or Chufut-Khale
* Vladikavkaz, Karmadon Gorge and the Necropolis in Darvgas
* Grozny and a wonderful trek in Galanchezh region of Chechnya
* Southern Ingushetia including treks to Table Mountain and Erzi National Reserve

**What Went Right:** Pretty much everything major - despite the limitations by Corona everything in general went smooth without any incidents. Most landmarks and transporation options worked flawlessly.

**What Went Wrong:** Some few landmarks like Ostankino Tower in Moscow were closed without a comment due to the Corona measures and sadly couldn't be visited. Also many Western bank cards, credit cards and SIM cards won't work in Crimea due to Western sanctions, meaning you need to have some backup. Also because of annoying Corona measures I lost one day of travel between North Ossetia and Chechnya (which is a long story though).

**Recommendations:** GO TO RUSSIA (especially when the whole Corona circus is over).

**Final Verdict:** While maybe not as super adventurous and wild as South East Asia or the Middle East, Russia is a phenomenal mix of European and Oriental influences with extremely many facettes. Compared with other regions in the world it's also a safe and stable destination for a backpacking trip. Locals are lovely and hospitable people, especially in the countryside and in the south. The country simply has everything to offer for every taste, and even within 30 days you can only explore a fraction of the whole picture. While it was not my absolute favorite solo backpacking experience (that would rather be Iran or Vietnam) Russia is still very high in my personal list and I recommend anyone to visit it when things calm down again.

The bitter sting of failed travel romance,"I met this guy (currently travelling in Latin America)... we spent almost a week together whilst staying in the same hostel, kept in touch almost daily for a week afterwards and then tried to get things back on track when we met again in another city, though within a week it had collapsed. I won’t go into detail other than saying it failed because he was a lot less emotionally mature than I was, and I ignored a lot of red flags because our attraction was so intense.

3 weeks to be connected to someone whilst travelling felt like such long time... we were super into each other and even spoke about having feelings for each other and he even alluded to us having future on several occasions. 

 we ended it 3 weeks in and it hurt both of us. We carried on staying in the same town for 2 weeks afterwards and had some miserable and heated run ins. He finally left yesterday and wouldn’t even say goodbye to me. 

It’s a good thing he’s gone but equally It really hurts and I feel quite empty.

Has anybody else experienced similar? I swear it’s those “almost” situationships that hurt the most, and leave you feeling so stupid for getting so carried away in such a short space of time.

When would you feel confident enough to travel internationally again?,"Sorry if this is a repeat post or anything. Curious how other solo travelers are thinking about this.

Would you do anything differently post-pandemic? This is independent of destination, just when you personally would realistically book a trip internationally. Obviously, there has been news around the vaccine, but I think the unique risks of traveling alone make it something to be wary about and you can't be too safe right now.

Edit: sorry for not adding a ""now"" option, I didn't think about that to be completely honest

"As an American, I'm really nervous about being able to go on a good solo trip again before starting a career.","I know I'm not original in my sentiments here.

I had just discovered how much I love international solo travel earlier this year before the pandemic spread far and wide. I was going to make plans to travel more over the summer before going back to school. It would have been perfect, because I wanted to go backpacking once more before getting immersed in my career. Obviously, we've all had to make some sacrifices.

I am going back to school for computer science, and as much as I love it, I'm concerned that I shouldn't make the commitment yet. In the US as far as I'm concerned, it's standard to only get two weeks of vacation time a year. Seeing as how I am not expecting to travel any time soon, even with the vaccine being deployed, I'm so scared! Especially because if I don't get an internship this next summer, I'll have to get one the next. And then I should be ready to graduate, and a gap on my resume would look bad, I think.

I would love to become a digital nomad, but I don't know how realistic that is, especially since I haven't really honed my CS skills yet. I would also really love to move to another country, but I know how hard that is to do, too. Especially since English is my only language.

Any thoughts, advice, or similar feelings? Sorry if I sound whiney! Traveling and experiencing new places/ cultures is really what makes me feel happier to be alive. These past few months have been hard with nothing to look forward to.

Tips to meet people while solo traveling (even if you're awkward af like me),"I commented on someone's post about this but figured I'd make a whole post. I'm a huge fan of making friends while traveling and still keep in touch with random one-off friends I made in weird places. I think it's a special bond. Here are some ways I break the ice. 

**Note:** I've been on both sides of this as the lone traveler who has met and made friends with other solo travelers and groups, as well as the person in a group who has absorbed an orphan traveler into our group for the day/week. 

**These have worked for me:**

* **Wear or carry something distinctive, something that relates to your hobbies or passions.** I put stickers on literally everything and all my stickers relate to my hobbies/interests/bands/shows/books. So many people will stop and be like ""ahh, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy sticker!"" or ""The Office!"" (even though everyone loves The Office, doesn't matter). Talking about *something* leads to talking about anything. More people than you realize want to make friends, they just feel weird as hell like you do. I live in Alaska so if I put something that says Alaska on it, people will inevitably comment on it **but** be wary of geographically identifiable clothing as it can make you a target as a tourist in less safe places.
* **Just ask people why they're traveling and where they're from.** Everyone thinks they're a grand explorer when they leave home and they're dying to talk about it.
* **Be interested in listening, don't feel pressured to talk.** Being interested is way more effective in making connections than being *interesting,* as people are more likely to want to hear your stories if they feel bonded to you and not like you're some weird stranger, vomiting your story all over them. So ask questions and actually listen, listening is super rare and always extremely appreciated.
* **Act open and excited, people are drawn to that shit.** Don't be weird, but don't be jaded. Sometimes anxiety can manifest as someone looking bored/disinterested, but nobody wants to have to pry someone out of their shell to get to know them. Be mindful of your paralanguage (non-verbals) and how closed-off you seem.
* **Practice trying new social techniques.** If you fuck it up and make it weird, you will literally never see them again and nothing matters. I've done some insanely awkward shit in the name of travel and while I didn't always make a lifelong friend, I definitely have some interesting stories.
* **Be open to new things.** Just because something doesn't sound fun, doesn't mean it can't lead to something fun. Sometimes I think we travel to distant lands just to do the same shit we do back home. Challenge yourself. Your routine will always be waiting for you back home. For example, I went motorbiking in Bermuda for the first time, it was scary as hell and my new friend broke her ankle and I accidently drove into a prison complex but did I have fun? Fuck yeah.
* **Don't wait for others to do a cool thing.** Do that cool thing and you will invariably find people there who do cool things. Your friends don't want to go to an Irish pub in motherfucking Ireland? Well guess what that pub is full of? People who want to be in Irish pubs. 
* **Take an active interest in the local culture.** Locals love sharing the regional drama, love being experts in their country, and delight in foreigners who aren't just there to see That One Tourist Destination. Most of them will complain about tourists, and that's half the fun. Like I said, in Alaska we joke about Tourist Hunting Season and complain about how our downtowns are flooded with outsiders every summer, but given the chance we will regale you with our crazy outdoor adventures and brag about how our cousin's ex-boyfriend was a crab fisher on season 3 of That Crab Fishing Show Whose Name I Can't Remember.
* **Don't be sloppy.** Nobody wants to hang out a second time with the dumpster person who got blackout and stuck their group with their tab.
* **Go on dates!** (if you're single, obvs) I've met some cool-ass people while traveling and swiping. As long as you're up front about your boundaries and what you're looking for, lots of locals are down for a one-off date and they probably know the ""cool local spot"" that they're excited to show you. I got roasted by Judah Friedlander at a comedy show on a date in NYC once. Probably wouldn't have known about it if my dated hadn't told me about that comedy show. 
* **Lastly, don't get stuck in your demographic.** Some of the coolest people I've met while traveling were way older. For example, when I was 26 I did shots in Iceland with a 65-year-old travel agent while her husband cheered us on and she still sends me periodic updates about her grandkids. Old people are cool as hell, hang out with them.

why don't people try to fight back muggers in colombia?,"from what i understand, going to medellin or bogota is completely law less. it doesn't really matter how ""careful"" you are. if someone so much as sees that you have an iphone, you're basically guaranteed to encounter a mugger, from what i understand. it's ashame, can't even check your phone or the time because you want to avoid giving away you have ""value"" and instantly being marked as a target by potential on lookers

my question is, why don't people fight back? for example, if you know someone is likely to mug you just for walking down the street, why not prepare for it. i've read people get mugged so easily there. just walking in broad daylight around some people, then 2 guys approach you and pull out a knife, demand your phone, and then run off. and everyone around you just continues on with their day as if nothing happened, cause it's just so normal for that to happen

how about having some mace on hand, so that when you are approached and see the knife, you basically mace the guy in the face, give one swift kick to the balls, then just be on your merry way. it's not like others will stop you from doing this, or you will be caught by cops?",solotravel,itcantbestopped11
Kindness to a Weary Moroccan Traveler,"I love travelling. I've been solo traveling since I was in my twenties and actually prefer it because of the adventures I've had, though I look forward to including my partner one of these days. I'm really bummed right now, though about how unsafe and difficult it is to go anywhere, so I've been thinking about stories from the past. I wanted to share the experience that convinced me to keep solo traveling.

In 2007, I was a university student during a year abroad in Canterbury, England. On the advice of some people who had been in my program the year before, I decided not to go home, back to the states, for Christmas, but instead stay there and use the time for traveling. While most of my friends were going to Amsterdam for the legal pot, I had my heart set on going to Morocco because I wanted to experience Northern Africa, the first time I would be in a country where I was not the dominant race. I figured that it would be perfect to spend Christmas there since, as a predominantly Muslim country, I figured most business would be open through the season.

So, once classes were out for the winter break, I took a Ryanair flight over to Barcelona and spent a week in Spain before hoping on a bus from Madrid to the port city of Algeciras to catch the ferry over to Tangier.

Now about all that went as expected was I found where to purchase the tickets for my ferry and went over to the waiting area. I wasn't sure when the ferry would take off, but I figured it had to be soon. So I waited. And waited, And waited some more. I was there hours before it was time, evening slipped into night, and the waiting area was quickly filling up. I sat there until the wee hours of the morning, unsure when I was finally going to get to go but not terribly worried since I had no firm plans. Finally they started loading the boat, and I found myself on a cramped ferry and could only plop down on the floor in an empty space. I had no idea why so many people seemed to be trying to get to Morocco that night.

It was early the next morning, around 7:00 am by the time we got to Tangier. I was hungry and exhausted and really wanted to find a place to get some rest before continuing on down the coast the next day. As I was disembarking from the ferry, though, I was pulled aside, along with a few other people and had to wait for a rather gruff and unhappy looking customs officer to come talk to me. It turns out that the way customs works on this particular ferry is you get your passport stamped on the boat and then just show your passport as you disembark. There had been announcements but, because they were all in Spanish and Arabic, I didn't understand them. I was horrified and scared he was going to send me back to Spain but, after some questioning, he took out a stamp, stamped my passport, and sent me on my way.

I immediately realized something was up when I saw people literally on the street corners cooking goats. I would come to find out that, yes, I had escaped the Christian holidays in Britain, but my uncultured self forgot to check the Muslim calendar. I had arrived on Eid al-Adha, one of the holiest days on the Muslim calendar, and I was witnessing people out celebrating and preparing their feast. That's why there were so many people on my ferry. I started to panic: I knew I would be lucky that day to find a meal, much less lodging, that day.

I had picked out a pension, a small, cheap hotel, to stay in for the night, and found a taxi driver, who had no idea where it was. After driving around in circles, I asked him to drop me back off at the port, and then I realized the pension was only a block from the port on a pedestrian street. I walked up to the pension and stood at the front desk, exhausted, hungry, and more than a bit weary from the last twenty-four hours.

The owner of the pension walked up to the desk, a little surprised to see a customer at this time of the morning. I asked him if he had any rooms. Yes, he told me he did. I felt elated. For the first time this trip, something was going right.

""But I will not check you in!"" he told me. I looked at him, baffled. What was going on? Had I already offended him? Did I break some taboo without even knowing?

Sensing my confusion, he repeated, ""I will not check you in!"" He paused, looked at my face, and smiled. ""It is a holy day! I will not check you in until you have tea with me!""

It took me a moment to process what he'd just said. This man, who didn't know me, who had just met me, was asking me to have tea with him in honor of the Eid. I'd like to think he saw in my face a weary soul, way out of my element, and wanted to show me some kindness.

I did sit with him and with an Indian man I would find out was a regular at the pension. We talked about life. I told them my story as we had Moroccan mint tea with some bread and honey. I told them my story (the Indian man was briefly confused when I said I was from Indiana) and they told me theirs. We learned about one another that day. I also expressed my fear of not being able to find food on the Eid, and the owner reassured me.

""You are staying in my pension. You will eat tonight!""

I was overwhelmed by his generosity and, just before midday, crawled into a bed on the second floor, sleeping sounder than I had in ages.

That man is why I keep travelling. Travelling keeps reaffirming my belief that most people are basically good and want to be good people. His hospitality to a complete stranger who would have stayed at his pension even without it was so touching. I have since encountered generous, kind people in so many countries on multiple continents. The pension owner taught me that, even in a new country where I don't know the language or customs or traditions, even after a long, stressful day, there were people who could touch you and lift your spirits with a simple act of kindness.

I hope I'm half as good a person as that man.",solotravel,queerly_radical

Does anyone else not meet people when they travel?,"I read a lot of stories and threads in this sub that are detailing the amazing experiences that people have meeting other people, sex, travel romance and to me I can’t relate to any of that because I never meet anyone when I travel. Does anyone else not meet people? 

I still have fun but all my experiences are solo experiences I’ve not had a shared experience before which goes against what this sub usually experiences. 

People say they meet other people on walking tours; I’ve never been on a walking tour that didn’t just end at the finish and when we tip the tour guide people just went off and do their own thing. The last two walking tours I went to the majority of people there clearly knew each other and stuck with each other. 

Saying hello to people never seems to go past an introductory phase or the usual ‘where are you from’

I’ve been on tours and not met anyone. I went on a full day tour that involved boating and everyone there clearly knew each other and had formed their own groups and were talking together in their own languages so I ended up spending the day by myself getting the cuntest sunburn of all time. 

The most awkward tour was when it was me and these two women who knew each other, there was a 4th person but he cracked the shits about something and went off raging in to the sunrise and after trying to strike a conversation with the others and getting nowhere I just left it

In hostels I’ve not met anyone either. I usually go out during the day, come back for a snooze in the afternoon then go out for dinner and drinks in the evening and maybe it’s just bad timing but most of the hostels were either empty in the common area at the time or people were with their friends or doing some undisturbed so I usually do my thing alone. I go to bars alone and don’t meet locals but I usually don’t speak the language well enough. 

There was one hostel where there was a group dinner advertised so I went there, sat down, started saying hello and what not and the entire table was speaking French - I was neither in France nor am I French so I just left. 

On the days where I’ve not wanted to do much I noticed most people did the same thing I did going out during the day and night so the hostels were mostly empty and there wasn’t a “hey we both got nothing to do let’s go do something” person around. 

Maybe it’s just me doing something wrong I don’t know but my experience of travelling seems to be the complete opposite of the stories people post in here. Surely someone else has the same experience when they travel? I don’t find it to be the super social experience people say it is but maybe that’s because I won’t disturb a group if they know each other or speaking other languages to each other which I’d consider rude. 

I’ll usually try and say hello how are ya etc like when I was at hostel and got dinner I sat outside on the table and a group was already there but it didn’t go further than that. For whatever reason people don’t seem receptive to me and timing also doesn’t seem to align when meeting people so I usually just end up going to bars by myself, get hammered and find my way home some how.

It doesn’t really bother me too much since I don’t have any friends where I live so it’s no different and I’m used to isolation but I guess I had that expectation that travelling and doing things like tours and staying hostels gets people together when it doesn’t end that it doesn’t matter where I am in the world I’m still the same loser there as I am here",solotravel,PMmeYOURBOOBSandASS
Best/safest places to visit as a solo female?,"Hello!

Am I the only one who does this?,"I’m female in my late 30’s. Looking back on my years of solo travel adventures, I seem to have constant affairs with hotel/hostel workers.
Here’s a few of them: 

Egypt: 26 year old hotel manager in Cairo. Was upset I was dating another Egyptian guy. Bought me gifts, took me out to restaurants and an amazing day trip to the Red Sea. Had sex in my room twice. (All with protection of course) 

Dubai: half Emirati half Yemeni guy working at the check in desk. We flirted. After 3 days, brought me dinner to my room. Had sex. 

India: 22 year old Rajasthani guy who worked hard to become manager of hostel. Would flirt and bring me chai to my room every morning. He jumped into bed with me. 

Nepal: 28 year old upper class Nepali guy who’s parents owned 3 hotels. Took me on his motor bike to the most amazing restaurants and temples. Had sex twice in my room. When I left he slept in my bed for a week without changing the sheets. 

Kuwait: Syrian guy. Flirted for a while. Came to my room to watch tv. Took of his pants and asked if I like what I saw. I did. 

Tunisia: a guy my age working at the front desk. Took me around Carthage, trendy bars and restaurants. We took a road trip Down to the Sahara desert for the weekend. 

Morocco: Moroccan hotel manager who took me to all the souls in Marrakech and shared my bed for 2 nights

Cancun: head chef at resort from Vera Cruz. Cooked me amazing food and would come to my room after dinner service with a bottle of champagne 

I had a great time with all of them, but surely I’m not the only girl they do this to. I’m sure they hit up every attractive girl that comes through the doors.

When have you splurged way beyond your normal budget and was it worth it?,"I stayed for 80 euros for one night in a hotel in Northern Greece. Might not be huge bucks to some but considering I'm a life long backpacker who is normally slumming it in 5-12 euro dorms. 

It's because I was cycle touring and I ended up stranded in a small place with literally no other options. 

I mean, it was a nice place. Breakfast was amazing. Room was amazing. You can get very very nice hostels too with nice breakfasts but it did make me feel that for at least one day on every extended trip I should enjoy a taste of the (relative!) high life.  
Edit: One nice thing was that, because presumably they aren't used to cycle tourists in nice hotels and the hotel was quiet (low season) I got a bit of the old VIP treatment! A very exuberant Greek chef came out when I was having my breakfast with an extra dish or two saying things like ""this very special Greek pie - will give you lots of energy for your cycling!"" And then gave me a few chocolates to give me more energy for my journey. Especially welcome as that morning turned out to otherwise be a very rainy miserable morning of cycling. 


On the other hand, I paid similar for a premier inn some random ass town in Southern England when I missed my train and again had no options. And it was literally no nicer, if not less nice, than a good hostel.

That's hotels though - there's also tours; attraction fees; transport; meals; whole destinations like Bhutan, the high arctic, North Korea, Turkmenistan or Pacific islands generally (I've been to two from that list: Papua New Guinea and Svalbard and both were worth it). 

I feel this is relevant to solo travel as things like hotels are more expensive to us and we are much more likely to slum it in general, but interested in your takes.",solotravel,pooey_mcpooface
Which country/destination made you truly feel like the adventurers or explorers of the past ?,"Hey everyone how's it going ?


If it wasn't for a certain pandemic I would be eagerly awaiting my solo trip to Peru and Bolivia which isn't going to happen anytime soon so I thought might as well plan my future bucket lists when international travel is allowed again. 


Now I know in this day and age there really isn't any truly 'uncharted' territory left and everything has been discovered and if its worth doing I wont be the first one there nor will I be the last. I mean if you really wanted to you can even book a trip to both the North and South pole or even climb Mt Everest (for a heavy price). 

I've been to Nepal for EBC and Tanzania for Mt Kili and although they are both extremely popular tourist destinations far from being 'uncharted' or 'off the beaten path' they still gave me the feeling of being a 'adventurer' in a 'unknown world' 


So I'm pretty much after locations/destinations that gave you the feeling like you are in the unknown wilderness far from civilisation and completely untouched or forgotten by humanity. Essentially if the destination or journey made you feel like the explorers and adventures of old I definitely want to hear about it !

Dolomites/swiss alps questions,"Hey y'all, I've been inspired by this subreddit to plan my first solo international trip for next summer and was wondering if anyone with experience in these places could help clarify a few specific things for me or at least point me in the right direction. 

My first question is that I plan to stay in a lot of rifugios/mountain huts in Italy and the swiss alps and I notice some websites say to ""bring your own sleeping bag""... Does that mean like an actual sleeping bag you'd bring camping/backpacking or something else? Because I also notice from pictures that the beds have a folded blanket on top of them. Also for rifugio locatelli's reservation page, it gives me the option of ""beds with bed linen (in 2,3,4 bed rooms) or mattress storage"" for accommodation type and I can't figure out what the difference is between those. It might be a weird English translation thing? 

My other question is regarding parking at tre cime to stay at that rifugio. In my current plan, I would arrive there by car in the afternoon, like around 2 or 3pm, but I've seen the internet say that the parking lot fills up by 10am. I assume people continually leave throughout the day so is it ACTUALLY possible that I could be blocked out from parking up there that day, even with an overnight reservation up there? 

Thanks! I'm from the US and my goal is to go end of august-early Sept if I'm vaccinated by then (probably)",solotravel,derpina321
What is the most unbelievable thing to happen to you while travelling solo?,"One of my favourite things about solo travel is the fact that it forces you to go outside your comfort zone. It's a lot easier to say yes to things you wouldn't usually do and this can result in the most insane/hilarious/scary/incredible things happening which are often some of the best memories of trips away. 

The one annoying thing I've found though, is when I get home and I'm telling people about my trip. I can sometimes tell that some of my friends think I'm bullshitting them with Walter Mitty-esque tales. It doesn't bother me too much but it's sometimes frustrating when I'm being honest but I don't have someone to corroborate my story. 

With that in mind, and with the promise that I'll believe your story no matter how insane it might sound, what is the most unbelievable event (or events) that has actually happened to you on your travels?

(I loved reading all the responses on the thread about people in hostels yesterday. Reading your travel stories gave me my first sense of optimism about getting away at some stage when all this is over).",solotravel,LeighAnoisGoCuramach
Motorcycle trips,"Hello,
I'm new to this sub, I had recently started to solo travel 2 summers ago on my Harley. I'm from MA and last year I made it to Acadia, the Catskills and few other MA destinations. My experience is limited but with the world returning to normal (hopefully) I plan on hitting the road again once warmer weather comes.

I'm wondering if anyone has any advice as far as motorcycle traveling goes.

Situations to avoid 

So far I have an old army back pack and basic camping supplies, this coming season I plan to ditch my bulky tent and go with a hammock and utilize public land to camp and hit hostles when I can. I found the tent to be nice but a pain in the ass to break down and set up every day.

Who was the oddest person you ever met at a hostel?,"I don't necessarily mean it in a sinister way. Just like... the most odd/BIZARRE (not OLD 🙃). 

I was in one of the Budapest Party hostels about 5 years ago and one of the other solo travellers there was obsessed with chess. Would only talk about chess. Commandeered the hostel chess set and went from group to group trying to play it with every guest. Absolutely dominated all of them. After the win, he would move on without saying much. 

On my last day there, I was his lucky chosen one. We started playing. I'm shit at chess. He took my queen after 5 or so moves. 

At this point one of the staff announces that anyone coming on the hostel organised day trip has 10 minutes to meet at the reception before they head off. Mr Chess must have reserved a place on this trip because he was getting noticeably nervous and prompting me to hurry up everytime it was my turn. I was getting destroyed so I of course purposefully slowed down. 

The ten minutes passed and he had to leave. Our match was far from over and he was freaking out. He insisted that we took a picture of the board and continued where we left off when he returned. He then quickly shovelled all the chess pieces into the box and brought the chess set with him on the day trip. 

After they left, I packed my stuff and moved on to Croatia. 

I often think about him and wonder if I was the only person he didn't beat on his trip.

Traveling in Egypt for 2 weeks,"Hello , 

I am traveling in Egypt for last 2 weeks of December.  I am flying in to Cairo and flying out of Sharm. My plan in this trip is to start with Cairo , see the ruins and know the history. Make my way south to Luxor and then across east to Dahab. Probably make a stop in Sharm for a night or dive there.  This is my tentative plan but I am open to suggestion. 

I have been doing my research but I would like opinion from people who have traveled to Egypt or know the country the following things. 

* Guides - I feel guide is important as there is so much history related to this place. I am not sure who i can hire them for a day or two. Would like to get a reliable source. 
* Tips - Looks like Egypt has a tipping culture ( atleast on the tourist sites) , I saw on the video's that people would expect tips if they help you take pictures or in transportation. Is it a must to tip ? how much would you tip ? I have no problem tipping in restaurants or for a cab , but for a picture ? Please let me know. 
* Covid - What is covid situation is Egypt ? I do not see much info online. Not that I am going to cancel the trip now  but any information will be helpful 

Places visiting 

* Cairo 
* Luxor / Aswan (may be)
* Dahab

Travel 

I am planning to travel in bus/train in between the cities. Will be taking ferry to Sharm. Does any one know if they are on operation ? One of the video I checked said it only runs/floats , during the peak season. Apparently this is a peak season , but we are all aware of the condition now. 

Interest in Egypt

* Culture 
* History 
* Diving

Anybody else not care about being the stupid American?,"Rn I'm in north Africa and I do a lot of stereotypically American things. I feed the stray animals, I give beggars money, I talk to strangers and I'm very friendly with them. (I'm actually half north African so I'm sensitive to the culture and know it well.)

Sometimes it hurts my feelings when they don't know I understand the language (even if I can't speak it very well) and I hear them make fun of me or intentionally overcharge me but I don't care if they think I'm being stupid. I don't care if this is extremely stereotypically American and I look naive and cringey.

What type of people did you meet along the way that had the biggest impact on your growth?

What is the best way to go about this?

Going to Greece next November - Aegina vs. Mycenae?,"I'm (hopefully) going to Greece in November if the pandemic allows for it to happen by then. I only have three full days, not including the day I arrive and leave, and I'm going to be spending 2 of them in Athens. For the third day, I'd like to take a day trip, but I'm not sure where.

I love history and culture and those are my two main interests in traveling. Mycenae is obviously a great historical sight, but I'd like to soak in at least one island and explore the natural beauty of Greece, since I know that's a huge attraction that all my friends and family tell me I need to see before I leave the country. The problem with Aegina though is that I'm not sure how lively the islands are during November and whether most stores, restaurants and attractions will still be open during that time of the year. 

Alternatively, I could spend an extra day in Greece and try doing both, but then I'd have to subtract a day from my Istanbul plans (I'm currently planning on four full days in Istanbul after Greece. It would be three if I want to spend another day in Greece.) I just feel pretty overwhelmed because there are so many options at hand, lol.

Turkish E-visa question- Do I have to wait 180 days between each trip to apply for a new e-visa?,"I am a Bangladeshi national planning a trip to Turkey at some point next year when things get better.

I am wondering if I can stay in Turkey for 30 days, leave and go to Georgia/Egypt/Balkans and come back a month later with a new e-visa? Or will I not be allowed to reapply until the 180 day period for the original one isn't over. If the latter is the case, I would apply for my visa 4-5 months ahead of my trip and time my trip just right, so I can leave for a month, wait out the ending of the 180 day period and re-enter with a new e-visa application. I was hoping someone more familiar with this would be able to correct me if I am misunderstanding the rules here. Thanks in advance

Solo Female trip to Nairobi in September,"  Hi Everyone, 

 Scott's Cheap Flights delivered once again! $650 USD tickets to Nairobi. Now this was pretty was spontaneous so I still have a lot of planning to do but you guys are really great with recommendations so I'll start here. Would love your recommendations, tips, tricks, must sees for Nairobi:

Interest: Mostly outdoor, camping, hiking, whitewater, beach, mountains, wildlife, art, Avant Gard, weird stuff, cooking

Length – Friday to following Saturday (9 days)

Budget – Would like to be as frugal as possible but willing to spend for the big experiences (treks, safari, flights, tours, etc). I anticipate either renting a car or hoping on a regional flight at some point for a few days outside of Nairobi. I can sleep anywhere that is safe and hope to camp at some point as well (either alone or with a tour). I prefer hostels over AirBnB or hotels if possible.

Other Considerations: I only speak English, I can read and understand French at a beginner level. I don’t know how to drive stick shift. I have experience travelling solo in Mexico, Slovenia, Barcelona, and USA. 

Questions on Car Rentals: Are there any surprises? Like in Mexico where the rental is $5 a day but the mandatory insurance is $500. 

Currency?: Should I expect local cash exchanges only or can I use my travel credit card?

Ideally, I imagine a few days in the capital and then the rest of the time travelling around Kenya via car, or possibly getting on a plan and travelling to somewhere else in the region. Flights to the continent of Africa are usually $1200+ in my area so I want to take advantage of the opportunity.

"Want to go see the world on my own, but I'm not sure if I was built too","Hey all, 20M here from the UK. For the longest time I've been fascinated with the countries of the world and the people and cultures in them. I really want to go start seeing them at some point, I have a super strong urge to just travel all over Europe this upcoming Spring (provided lockdown is over by then of course). However, I have some conditions that I think will make this quite hard. The big one is that I have a form of ASD and therefore can be prone to panic and being overwhelmed in unfamiliar environments. To add to this, I can sometimes have extreme difficulties in socialising because of it, although this has become much less of a problem in recent years. But a few years back when I was travelling in the UK on my own, I ended up having something of a total breakdown and have been put off going abroad ever since. Although I am still not sure what incited this breakdown since I was deeply depressed at the time but I'm now on medication which has made me much less prone to these incidents. 

I am not at all experienced with travelling abroad, with the exception of a few days in Paris on a high school trip over five years ago lol. Mainly because of the fear that my anxiety disorders and depression would just get the better of me for when I travel alone, as it has done domestically. I finish uni next Summer, having been locked on my own for nearly half of the three years I had spent there due to Covid and whatnot so I'm really eager to go explore when it is all over but I'm just not sure I have it in me to pull it off successfully. 

Has anyone else had similar experiences before they started solo travelling?

So, due COVID cancellations I have a bunch of carrier flight points to use in the US and wanted to spend 1-2 months in the country. Never been to the US before and I am planning to rely on buses and my bike to travel around as much as I can.

Thing is, this would be my first international bike trip, and my first time in the US. I would land in JFK and cycle down Washington and then Virginia.

Recommendations on where I should go! (first major solo travel ~ 3 weeks),"Hello, hope everyone is staying safe during these crazy times....
TL;DR

In my early/mid twenties from USA and will have about 3.5k to spend on a 3 week trip. Trying to decide between: South East Asia, Japan, or Europe 
Or if you have any other recs plz lmk!

Just a little background, I did my first ever backpacking trip with a friend from college in Europe for ~ 1 month. It was fantastic, but honestly my favorite part of the trip was when we split up for about a week (no drama or anything, he just went to see family) and i got to experience staying in a hostel by myself and planning all my own activities. I was so surprised at how easy it was to meet people and felt so free not having to plan around someone else!

That was about 1.5 years ago(summer 2019, I know, we got so lucky we got that trip in before all this happened) and honestly, ever since then I’ve been dreaming about my next trip (solo) and saving for it. So far I have about 2.5k saved for a trip and am planning to save another 1k in the coming year. So ~3.5k in total is my budget

After I get the vaccine and travel is back to normal I’m thinking I’m going to take 3 weeks off work either 4th quarter 2021 or early 2022.

Looking for recommendations on where I should go. I’ve heard South East Asia is really good for first time solo travelers and has an established backpacker infrastructure but the only place I’m really interested in so far would be Thailand. I imagine 3 weeks would be too much time in one country but lmk if you think otherwise or have any other recommendations in SEA.

I’ve also always been fascinated with Japan and really want to visit Tokyo/Osaka. However I know that not much English is spoken and I worry it would be a little too much for a first time solo trip. Also Japan will be there and maybe better for when I am older (in early/mid twenties rn)

And my last thought is to go back to Europe and go to some of the countries I skipped/really liked. Portugal and Spain. Or maybe go with the northern route. I did really like Europe!

I know this is pretty vague and I’m super fortunate to have still been employed and be able to save this amount for a trip. Any recommendations would be helpful on those 3 I talked about or honestly if you have an entirely different place I hadn’t thought about please do tell!!!
And do you think 3.5k is a good budget for 3 weeks? Or if that is that overkill, I could always spend less and save the rest for my next solo trip down the line.

I love to day hike and am experienced and spry enough to attempt some fairly tough mountainous adventures. I won't have a tent or anything, since I'll be carrying all my supplies in a single carry-on bag, so overnight hikes are a no-go, especially since I'm a lone lady. 
Do you have any good and solo-safe recommendations for day hikes that I can walk, hike, bus, or train near to its trailhead? I'll be spending most of my time backpacking in Eastern Europe, but will be commencing my journey in the UK and France, and will continually keep my eyes open to cheap flights to Greece and surrounding islands, and also the Nordic countries. If there are any unmissable and easily accessible hiking spots that are safe for solo adventures and that are along common tourist routes, I would love to know! If any of the hikes are special in specific months, like some of the hikes in Norway with its Aurora Borealis season, that would also be great to know. 
Thank you!",solotravel,STF-ImStudying
Can Workaway be immoral?," I'm very interested in using workaway but am worried about the potential immoral aspects of workaway or voluntourism in general, for example:

* Taking positions that could/should be done by paid locals
* Being unskilled, especially in construction, then creating more problems down the line
* Creating a dependency on foreign aid rather than improving the local community
* Short lived engagements with children creating separation anxiety for them

Do you think these are problems with workaway and if so how can you avoid perpetuating them when using workaway?

p.s. I don't mean to offend anybody, and don't necessarily think these things I'm just interested in your opinions/ help before I start workawaying. Thank you!",solotravel,archersonly

I finally found personal value in keeping a travel log,"Memories are something that I cherish and travelling brings me some of the most valuable memories I've ever had. However, some of them are lost from my mind and there are personal experiences that I should record because they were perceived from my own eyes, ears, etc. There are also places that I want to return to, and there's always the possibility that various attractions will be added or modified over time. That is mostly why I want to have a travel log now so that I can personally see history play out with my own eyes and take in my environment in the most gleeful, optimistic way I can. Outside of my work-a-day life, I want to tread wherever I can on my own and find the constantly changing beauties of the world and forever embed those moments into my mind. I've already been to Bangkok, but I'd like to compare it to the underacknowledged Chiang Mai, and a travel log will definitely help me with that to the fullest extent possible",solotravel,tennlene
Does anyone else feel like traveling will suck for a couple years after COVID?,"Once most of the world is vaccinated, and assuming things open up enough that we go back to some semblance of normal, millions of people who have been cooped up in their homes are going to want to get out at the same time.

I expect to see demand for hotels and flights surge, with prices skyrocketing, and travel destinations being swarmed with tourists. As someone who doesn't mind the usual tourists, but finds solace in a quiet, less-crowded nook of a city or travel site, I feel like we're not going to get anywhere near that at least for a few years until everyone scratches their travel itch and start to forget about home lockdowns all together.

Need Help With International Phone Plans,"I'm in the process of planning my first solo international trip, optimistically for late spring/early summer 2021, and I'm at the point where I'm trying to figure out what phone plan I need.  

I am surprisingly technologically inept for being a millennial, so my absolute number one requirement would be convenience and a hassle-free experience.  Essentially, I want to step off the airplane and have my phone work normally as it would at home.

Through my research I am currently leaning towards Google Fi, it seems to be the easiest to use and also works immediately in most countries.  However, I have also seen good things about T-Mobile plans and of course the very popular and common method of buying local sim cards, however, that adds a few more steps to the process of having my phone operate normally in foreign countries.

Has anyone from the US tried booking a trip overseas recently?,"I have vouchers from Iberia airlines left over from Covid, they have to be used by June 2021. 

I keep getting emails from them reminding me to use them, so yesterday I figured why not… I  found a good trip to Barcelona, went through the whole process of applying the voucher and putting my credit card info in, and after trying multiple times, it wouldn’t accept my payment. 

my thought process was… I know that we’re currently banned from traveling there, but I’m hoping we will be able to by the summer. I figured I could just book the trip and if we were still banned, I would reschedule it again. 

I didn’t think that there would be some sort of gatekeeping mechanism in place on the airline website, but I could be wrong.

Best places in the US for solo women,"I realized I haven't traveled much domestically, so would love any suggestions for destinations and journeys in the US for a solo female traveler. Some considerations:

- I’ve lived in large East Coast cities (NYC/Boston/DC), and in general, would like to avoid spending too much time in very large cities like LA etc. I’m thinking more like smaller cities (e.g. New Orleans or Portland, ME) or non-cities.

- Length: 2-3 weeks.

- I'd love to see as much of the country I can by train, like how people buy an Interrail/Eurail pass to see Europe. I can’t drive, and while flying is an option, I’d ideally want scenic views during the journey.

- Budget: I’m unsure about this, so estimates would be helpful. I’ve saved up and was thinking around $4k, and while obviously the less the better, I’m willing to go up a bit if that seems unrealistic. I’m not seeking luxury, but want to be reasonably comfortable and safe.

- Interests: Food is super important, I don’t care where I get it from as long as it’s delicious; no dietary restrictions, and am very open to trying new foods. I also love to just walk around, surrounded by beautiful scenery or interesting architecture. Not as interested in museums or nightclubs.

- Safety: I’m a woman of color, so yeah, while I wish this were an irrelevant fact, anything that minimizes my risk of sexual assault/racism would be great.

Thanks in advance!

Europe in Three weeks,"So I booked a Contiki for April this year, and low and behold COVID happens and everything gets cancelled 4 weeks before I'm supposed to travel. I've accepted that it was actually a great thing because I realized that the trip included places I didn't particularly want to see (because it was included in the overall trip), and I don't want to waste valuable time in a bus. So I am going at it alone, I'm planning to go to Paris, Italy (Florence, Rome, Venice), Berlin, Amsterdam and London. 

\- PARIS 4 DAYS - FLORENCE 2 DAYS - ROME 3 DAYS - VENICE  2 DAYs - BERLIN  3 DAYS  - AMSTERDAM  3 DAYS.

How reasonable does this sound? The Contiki trip was 1500 euros for 14 days but from my planning its coming to about 1000 euros (my budget in total is 2000 euros but I can go over). 

 The plan is to just book hostels/airbnbs and use flights/trains to travel between cities. Please recommend some trustworthy sights that I can use compare/book on, I've just been using google and going off of that.

Does anyone else go through a week-long phase every year or so where they get insanely excited about solotravel?,"That's what's been happening to me this week! I've been nonstop reading through posts on this subreddit, looking through my old travel blog/photos, researching plane tickets, visa requirements and so on.... I think being all cooped up in quarantine is giving me even more travel-lust

So as a result I decided to plan on my next big trip! In March of 2023, I will have been at my current job for three years and will have certainly saved up more than enough to take a year off for solotravel. I plan on giving my notice and then starting my travels in May of that year. Here is my loose itinerary:

# PART 1: THE MEDITERRANEAN, EASTERN &amp; CENTRAL EUROPE

**May:** Fly to Israel via Birthright. Since I'm Jewish I can go on an all-expenses-paid 10 day trip to Israel. The catch is it's not solotravel because I'll be with a group, and also I'm really not a Zionist, but hey it's a free plane ride to the middle east. After the trip is over I plan on hoping over to Istanbul where I'll spend the rest of the month couchsurfing and exploring the city

**June:** Start moving westward. I'd like to check out Sofia and Athens. Maybe I'll find a workaway/helpx program to join for a few weeks

**July**: Work my way up the Adriatic Sea and check out Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Croatia.

**August:** Head to Budapest and spend 2-3 weeks there. This was my favorite city when I did my very first solotrip in 2012 and I always wish I could have spent more than just a few days there. Towards the end of the month, I'll start working my way north into Slovakia and then Poland where I'd like to pay my respects at a concentration camp.

**September:** Head to Berlin, where I'll spend most of the month couchsurfing or helpxing. I have some friends there from my 2016 SEA trip I'd like to reconnect with!

# PART 2: THE HIMALAYAS &amp; SOUTH ASIA

**October:** With the cold weather approaching in Europe, it'll be time to change things up! I plan on flying from Berlin to Kathmandu to spend a month trekking. I hear this is the best time of year as the monsoon will have just ended

**November:** India! After I'm done trekking I'd like to check out Delhi and Rajasthan. As usual I'll be couchsurfing, helpxing and staying in hostels

**October:** Start working my way further south and spend a good chunk of time in Mumbai

**November:** Continue southward and spend time in Goa

**December:** Explore the southern tip of India I guess? I honestly have no idea what's even there and what to expect but why not!

**January:** Sri Lanka! I think I could spend a month here

**February:** If at this point I've had enough of South Asia, I'd like to check out Japan for a month before heading back home (big bucketlist item is to stay in a capsule hotel). I'm thinking a couple weeks in Tokyo, a couple weeks exploring rural japan.

**March:** Pit stop in Costa Rica to see some family and then head back to the USA to begin job hunting and piecing my life back together!

How's this all sound? Is it crazy to be planning like this 2 1/2 years ahead of time? I feel like my India plan could be more fleshed out, I really don't know much about India, but I guess that's part of the appeal!",solotravel,Retawekaj

Serendipitous solo travel moments,"I remember when I was making my way from Vietnam to Thailand. I was sitting in the Hanoi airport on the way to Bangkok and made eye contact with another traveler taking the same flight. I didn’t really think anything of it until we noticed each other again waiting for a taxi in Chiang Mai. We went our separate ways but were again brought together at a 7-11 a  number of hours later buying the same snacks and water. 

At this point, we spoke and decided the coincidence was too strong to ignore. We shared the rest of the evening at a nearby bar, had a great conversation, drinks, and food, and then parted our separate ways. It was as if we’d known each other for years - such an impactful experience. I tried to get her contact info so we could meet up in the future, but must've taken it down incorrectly so I never saw her again.

"How to go out in ""riskier"" countries?","Hey!

So I've traveled to a few places before and stayed at hostels. However this has been mainly in Western Europe and Japan. Japan is extremely safe and I feel comfortable walking home with someone I met at the hostel completely shit faced at 2 in the morning. The same goes for European countries where I know what I'm doing. Of course there is always a safety risk but I see the risk as quite low. But here comes my problem: in poorer places or just places that are not as safe, how do you go out? I'm asking this because I'm currently in Colombia but I'm too afraid to do anything. I'll go out during the day and explore but avoid the bad areas (again being very cautious) and have an early dinner and stay at the hostel. I'm afraid to go out in to the dark streets of Colombia and go drinking somewhere. If we are in a big group I'll go out but avoid having more than a beer. I constantly read stories here about people going out and drinking,doing drugs etc. This is what I like and what I want but don't dare to. This question is not Colombia specific, I'm asking about all countries that wouldn't be considered ""very safe"", so even countries in SEA like Vietnam or Thailand.   


So, how do you guys do it? Maybe I'm too cautious since I avoid many situations even during daytime while alone exploring. But then again, I don't want to get robbed or worse, injured in any way.

What's the most affordable city you've been to with the best amenities for everyday living?,"For me it would have to be Medellin. You could take the metro and cable car everywhere and Uber is dirt cheap. Airbnb's are plentiful and you can find nice rooms for 200 a month or sometimes even less. Restaurants give great discounts with their ""menu del dia"" options which helps cut costs even more. On top of this it's a beautiful city with great nightlifte, etc. So far it's been difficult for me to find places that compare. 

When things calm down I was thinking of returning to Medellin for a while to work remotely, but at the same time I'd like to explore other areas. I still haven't gotten the chance to venture out to Eastern Europe and SEA, which are next on my list.

Greece May 2021 questions,"Seeking feedback on a planned solo trip to Greece 2021, COVID situation dependent.

I’m primarily interested in hiking/exploring with bars and music at night. Beaches are nice, but swimming not a focus on this one. 

I’m date flexible, but trying to balance good weather (not a fan of overcast) and meeting other travelers with beating the stampede. 

Tentative schedule

May 4/5th: USA -&gt; Athens (get in 10pm)

May 6th or 7th: -&gt; Rhodes

(Possible ferry to Fethiye/Bodrum In here)

May 12th: -&gt; Crete

May 16th: -&gt; Athens

May 17th: Delphi day trip

May 18th: -&gt; USA 

# Date questions 

1. Is this too early weather wise? I’m under the impression that Rhodes especially, but also Crete will likely have sunny weather, and great temp for hikes. But would bumping to mid/end of May be wise? 
2. Likewise, from a seasonal perspective. I know COVID adds uncertainty here, but should stuff mostly be open by early May? Will anyone be around? As a solo, I certainly don’t want to be in a ghost town.

# Crete vs Paros/Naxos 
My first choice is probably Paros/Naxos instead of Crete since it’s so huge and intimidating with the limited time I have. I also like being able to day trip from Paros to Naxos for hiking (and possibly Santorini). However, I’m under the impression Crate should be much more active by early May than Paros/Naxos and much easier to get to from Rhodes. Is this likely the case? Is it worth pushing to mid/end May and switch to Paros?

# Turkey
Is it worth making time to hit Fethiye or Bodrum from Rhodes? Especially if I can extend the trip by a few days? I’d really like to do it, assuming the ferries will be running at that time, and it won’t be a headache. 

I’ve been reading a ton of info online about solo traveling Greece, but I’d love any advice anyone can give about where and when to go. And tips for Solo in the Greece islands.

"I'm lost. I want to live abroad but I don't know if it's possible or where to start. Just kind of poured my thoughts out and would appreciate insight or advice. Not sure where to ask so I just posted here, sorry if it doesn't belong.","*Preface as to where I'm at with school and how I feel about jobs-* 

I’m a junior in high school and coming to terms with the fact that I have an entire life ahead of me independent from my parents. I have to make something of my life. I have to find fulfillment and happiness, and at the same time be self sufficient. There are an inconceivable amount of possibilities yet I have to hone down on a singular path. I have to take a first step and I don’t exactly know what it should be. 

School has been a mess and I have absolutely zero passion or interest in any class I’ve taken. I suppose some aspects of literature and history have been interesting here and there, but the work revolving around anything related to school is so draining. It’s incredibly hard to motivate myself to do homework or to study and I can’t imagine pursuing an actual career related to the subjects I’ve stumbled across. The thought of being rooted in one place pursuing some career in whatever field my college degree happens to be in sounds horrible. 

There’s something about tasks that require lots of thinking where I’m expected to meet a deadline that doesn’t click with me. Writing essays, studying calculus, reading about cellular respiration, and anything in between is incredibly hard. I just can’t focus on it. I have a much easier, relaxing time doing mundane, physical tasks like mowing a lawn or stocking shelves than I do complex tasks that require deeper thought. Maybe it’s like this for everyone, but I guess I don’t have the stamina or willpower for it. It’s too hard and too stressful. If I’m going to have to work to make money I’d rather it be something easy than it be something hard. 

I’m content with the thought of working a low paying, low skill job for the rest of my life. I feel it's wishful thinking to believe there’s a sizable chance I’ll find a job that I enjoy doing, and I’m sure most people end up not liking the job they get stuck with. Might as well cut my losses rather than try to grasp at something that’s not there. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Travel related part-*

This leads me to my issue. There is an abundance of trades that pay relatively well, or even just jobs managing the local walmart or whatever, but anything in the states just sounds boring and depressing. Living in the same town for years on end is boring. The world genuinely interests me and I want to explore it. I want to travel, and not the sight-seeing vacation type, but just experience everything. I wanna be able to settle down in any old European town and live there until I grow bored of it and wish to seek a new culture or landscape. I don’t care for the materialistic side of things like having a nice home or nice cars. As long as I have my basic necessities covered and I’m not homeless I’m sure I’ll be fine. 

The problem is I don’t know if it’s possible to pick up jobs in foreign countries, especially if I’m not fluent in the language. I don’t know if I’ll just be able to show up in a city and find employment relatively quickly. Maybe I will need to settle down someplace in the states and work to save money by living below my means so that I can afford to travel the world X amount of months out of every year. 

It’s so overwhelming and I’m having trouble articulating my thoughts. I really do just want to go out and explore the world, live my life in the moment. I don’t want to be tied down with a family driving my kids to soccer every weekend, working my 9-5 so that I can pay the mortgage on my house in the suburb and put food on the table. I’m just scared I’m gonna graduate and go move to Europe with 10,000 dollars in my bank account, stay for a month unable to find employment and end up on the streets with nowhere to go. Maybe I should get a college degree so I have something to default on. I just want to live this nomadic lifestyle and experience what there is to experience, but I don’t know where to start. I don’t even know if it’s possible. I’m not even sure this entire rant even makes sense, but I’d appreciate any advice or insight.",solotravel,imadrowninmysorrows

So is everything going to be fully books/overstretched/insanely crowded at some point in the next two years?,Maybe I'm selfish asking this but can't be the only one wondering.

Spending Christmas/New Years Eve on the road,"Hey folks, has anyone here spent Christmas and/or New Years eve solo travelling, if so, where did you go and how was the experience been?

I've travelled for 2 years in a row now to Belgium and Germany for the days between 26th Dec to 31st - usually non eventful days off for me anyway so I just go on a quick trip to Europe. 

For me, I actually enjoy going for a quick trip during those times, its very quiet as you would expect, but to me its actually nice to walk around and see the sights in peace away from large crowds.

Its ironic as well because I feel the 'Christmas spirit' more so when I am away from home, maybe due to the extremely cold winter and the chance to drink gluhwein or whatever haha.

I'm thinking of actually spending the whole period abroad - obviously not this year but maybe for next NYE and beyond. I normally stay in hostels, wonder if they are empty by new years eve?

Possibly just around Europe again to save a bit.

Any painters on the road? What's in your bag? Tips?,"I've just recently started to pick up watercolor as a stress relief hobby. I used to paint for fun in school, but stopped over a decade ago--losing all my penmanship and dexterity since I only use my hands for typing these days. I'm just starting to relearn everything, but really liking it so far. 



I like the idea of plein air painting. I love the quiet people-watching moments that solo travel allows, when you have all the time in the world to sit and soak in the ambiance. Usually I just absent-mindedly drink some coffee and leave when I'm done, but I figure plein air painting would be a great way to really appreciate my environment and commit it to memory. There's been so many instances solo traveling where I want to soak in my environment and have an excuse to sit around for an hour lol. 


Does anyone else paint on the road? If so, what are your supplies? Do you have any advice or recommendations? I've bought one of those mini tins that can cram 18 watercolour half pans, but I'm looking for small brushes and other mini equipment that won't take up much space. I'm into minimalist travel, and it'd be great if I could find supplies to fit in small spaces for backpack-less day trips (eg with a small fanny pack or crossbody purse).

Renting a car long term.,"Hello!

I'm planning a 4 months long euro trip and having some troubles regarding the vehicle which I'll use.

At first I was considering buying a cheap 2nd hand car but as it turns out, it's quite problematic in Spain where I will begin the trip.
I'm now looking at the option of renting a car and I'm having a hard time finding a cheap long-term car rental deal.

Does this look as bad as it looks? Awkward solo travel moment...,"I was on a plane from Tangier to Rome seated next to a very sweet old lady wearing a hijab. She spoke no English, and I speak no Arabic nor Spanish, though between us we made a little headway with our equally shaky French and plenty of friendly gesticulating.

At some point in the flight I realised I smelled very much like a smelly backpacker. So, when I had to go to the bathroom, I took my roll-on with me to freshen up a bit out of consideration for my friendly seatmate. I was in the plane’s toilet cubicle and there wasn’t much left in the roll-on bottle (one of those Nivea ones with the thick gel-liquid-stuff) so I shook it to get it the dregs to go onto the ball.

Horrifyingly, the ball popped off the end of the bottle (which has *never ever* happened to me before) and the fucking deodorant flung out in a slash all over the mirror, basin and my jeans. The deodorant gel was white, not clear, so I started panicking and thinking “I have GOT to get this off my pants.” I tried wiping it with toilet paper but that just pilled and made grains of toilet paper stick to my leg and crotch in an incriminating blotchy white line.

It definitely looked as bad as it looked. I’d been in the bathroom for ages at that point and eventually had to head back to my seat with a long white stain down the groin and left leg of my black skinny jeans. There was nothing discrete about my re-entry and my new friend refused to gesticulate with me for the rest of the trip. Shame – a lost opportunity.

Month long solo UK trip - Summer 2021 - Is this feasible?,"Hey solotravel!

With news of the vaccine being great across the board (so far and fingers crossed), I am starting to look to Europe for a long awaited solo trip. I am specifically planning a trip **around the UK in the June for a little over a month** and I am curious of everybody's thoughts around here on the details of my trip, specifically from a solo traveler perspective because I'll be totally alone for basically all of this and I figure folks around here have done similar trips in the past.

I am an American and I have never been to the UK (only been to Europe once as a high schooler in Italy), so I am a noob across the board. But I really want to see a bunch of stuff. 

**Here's my trip outline:**

* **London** - June 2nd-June 7th (**4 full days** in London, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Liverpool** - June 7th-June 10th (**1 full day** in Liverpool, 1 day trip to Manchester, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Edinburgh** - June 10th-June 15th (**4 full days in Edinburgh**, 1 day trip to Loch Lomond, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Glasgow** - June 16th-June 20th (**3 full days in Glasgow**, two travel days in/out)
* **Belfast** - June 20th-June 23rd (**2 full days in Belfast**, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Dublin** - June 23rd-June 25th (**2 full days in Dublin**, 2 travel days in/out)
* **Birmingham** - June 26th-July 2nd (**3 full days in Birmingham**, 1 day trip to Oxford, 1 day trip to Cambridge, 2 travel days in/out)
* **London** - July 2nd-July 6th (**3 full days in London, 2 travel days in/out)**

When I say travel in/out I basically mean half days where traveling is the priority, so for that first London date I'd be flying in on the 2nd and leaving for Liverpool on the morning of the 7th.

Are there any stops on here that are way too long? I don't need to be go-go-go for every part of this trip, I wouldn't mind relaxing here and there. I tried to build that rest into some of the Birmingham time because I figure I'll be a bit worn out by then, and that town is centrally located and low key so I thought it'd be good for day trips and rest. Again I'm alone so I'm really just into museums and nature and wandering around.

I plan on using trains to get around for the most part, though I have become aware that renting a car may be easier for an American than I originally thought. So we'll see on that!

Does anything stick out as red flags on this trip? I'm really just looking for general thoughts and reactions from seasoned travelers. I appreciate any feedback! Obviously, this is all COVID contingent, so here's hoping that the vaccine distribution is successful across the world.

**EDIT:** Thanks so much for all of the advice so far! It sounds like the consensus is for sure that it is too city heavy right now and that I should lean more towards smaller towns and countrysides. I think I am going to take that to heart for sure. The other advice is that Ireland and Northern Ireland are worth doing separately and I think I am starting to agree with that. Also I'm impressed only one person corrected that Dublin is not in the UK haha, I know that but looking at the map it made for an easy loop around. I understand it's a whole different place though.

I'm starting to think that I will reduce the number of nights in the cities and do some research on specific spots across the mainland that would be a bit smaller/more nature focused. I'm also thinking that if this does go on to be the first leg in a greater European trip, maybe I can round out the trip in Ireland at the end and spend more time outside of its cities.

I really appreciate all of the advice! This has been so helpful so far.",solotravel,l0ngstorySHIRT

On my last trip, I traveled to a city that had so much to see and do that I was *constantly* on the move, every minute of the day.  Because of that, I was exhausted by each evening, and having only a few drinks at the hostel just sent me to bed right as everyone was getting ready to go out or the night was starting.

Learning a Language While Traveling,"Have any of you had any luck learning a language by moving to a new country for about a year? I really want to learn Spanish but my accent doesn’t help and it doesn’t help that the country I live in doesn’t speak Spanish. I’m seriously considering moving to South America for about a year in hopes of learning, but moving alone and not knowing the language feels daunting. I’ve solo traveled countless times but English was known enough in the countries I’ve been to that I’ve been able to get by on that alone. This is also something I’m planning for in the future, hopefully once COVID slows down so I can visit other countries/cities while I’m out there. So any tips on preparing before the move would be helpful as well. I know a good amount of vocabulary but struggle with listening/speaking/sentence structure. I’ve considered Argentina and Chile the most, but am afraid that the big cities I have in mind will still speak a fair amount of English and counter my whole reason for the move. I live in Europe and have considered doing a month or two long course in Spain but honestly think South America would be a better adventure. What do you think?",solotravel,MetMeInTheAfterglow
How I can meet people while solo traveling North America?,"Since March, I haven't left my house. The only people I have had any in-person social interaction with are my immediate family members. I am taking a gap year before beginning college next year. 

I can't leave my house because I have to take care of a parent who has a condition whereby getting COVID can be very dangerous. By April or May I can leave because my dad is gonna come back from abroad. 

I can feel that my social abilities are becoming weaker. I feel awkward even when talking to friends on Zoom.

I was planning to backpack South America around May-July, but I realized that most international borders may still be closed to tourists and there would be many restrictions. Now I am planning to take Amtraks to different parts of North America. I am not planning to camp or do any wilderness related traveling. 

How can I meet people while doing so? Where should I go? What should I do specifically? 

I would like to interact with lots of people so that I can practice social skills, lose any awkwardness I feel now, and regain whatever I lost during this period. 

In Europe or certain parts of South America, hostels are popular which is a good way to interact with people. Is there any equivalent in America?",solotravel,Intrepid-Composer730

When should we be planning for post-covid world travel?,"**Sorry if this has been discussed endlessly already, but search yielded little results.**

With many vaccines about to be distributed, when should we realistically expect to be able to travel freely and enjoy the world unfettered by masks and restrictions? Europe, SE Asia, and South America may have different timelines.

I'm hoping for the best, but planning for the worst. The bankers (Goldman Sachs) announced they believe 70% of the developed world will be vaccinated by fall 2021.

Considering realistic expectations, I'd wager that it's really not until 2022 that we have a return to normal, assuming no surprises. Regionally 2021 will be better for everyone, but international travel may still be restricted, or at a minimum you'd still encounter covid-related obstacles around the world.

Tried to do a local trip by myself,"I feel like it was a fail cause I ended up chickening out. Basically I booked this Airbnb which wasn’t far from where I live to go hiking by myself. When I got there it was like middle of nowhere and tbh I was immediately uncomfortable because there were a bunch of White supremacists signs on a few peoples homes in the area. But since I already paid for everything i decided to stay. The Airbnb was pretty nice and relaxing with a view of the lake. Then I went out to the hiking trail. I kinda got lost and my car was not suitable for the terrain so I had to leave it. I started walking to the trail it was bright and sunny but a little cold. I did see a few older people on the trail. For some reason I felt really uncomfortable being alone. I just couldn’t do it and turned back. 

I went back to the Airbnb. Basically I ordered food got some wine, watched Home Alone and went to sleep. The next morning I left my trip early and went home. I don’t know why but I just was feeling really sad. I’ve always wanted to do this and it just didn’t work out. I’ve always went on trips with people (family, friends, former partners, etc) this was supposed to be my first solo trip and it just sucked. My anxiety, depression and stuff since my breakup really messed with my head 

I’m gonna try again and research better next time. But anyway, i know this wasn’t really traveling since it was only a short road trip away.

Travellers on Capitalism,"I'm a 24 year old male from Canada and I feel as though I have no direction in life. This might not be the right subreddit to talk about this but I feel travelers have a great perspective on life. I'm currently working and the job by all accounts is fine, but I'm starting to get into the 9-5 grind and I'm not excited about the prospect of doing this for the next 40 years. I've been thinking about on moving to a larger city maybe doing a program overseas like JET before COVID, but with it has come a delay which has left me a lot of time for contemplation. 

I have a good career trajectory but I feel as though I've been on the rollercoaster of life without much of my own say in the matter and now here I am. I can continue down this path and live a life of comfort and stability, which I can build upon with family and friends and no doubt will I be happy, as I understand these are luxuries are not provided to all who walk this world but there's still a part of me that yearns for something different. I think this comes from my past of traveling doing three separate solo travel trips. These trips have certainly impacted my life and made me less reliant on physical items for happiness and more on experiences which goes against the capitalist system that we as humans are forced to live within, so I guess my questions lies there. I assume most travellers live with the ideology of experiences over materialism, but how are we to cope with life when reality by all accounts forces us down a path of capitalism and conformity?

Solo Travel while Partnered,"Howdy, everyone. 

Does anyone have any advice for not feeling guilty about traveling solo while you’re partnered?

I discovered solo travel after a manipulative and emotionally abusive relationship, and it’s truly become a part of who I am.  My longest trips have been 3 weeks in Southeast Asia and 4 weeks in Portugal and Spain.  I love seeing the world and connecting with my inner-most self.

I’m lucky to be in a secure and loving relationship, now, and my partner embraces, supports, and actually encourages my solo travel.  It feels weird, to be honest!

(As an aside, we also travel together and I enjoy it, but solo travel is still my favorite.)

Does anyone have any suggestions for combating that guilty feeling?  I feel like I “should” want to travel with him more than I want to travel solo (even though I know this is a cognitive distortion and I’m lucky to have a partner that gets it that solo travel is part of my DNA).

Do most people travel carrying their passport on them at all times. The moment I arrive in a place I immediately lock up my passport in either the hostel storage locker or hotel room I’m staying in. Only time I have it on me is in the airport or crossing borders if needed. I usually just carry my US state ID with me in case I need identification for anything.

Is there a reason people carry it with them at all times that I’m missing? Or should I be carrying it with me at all times?

Help me with my first international solo trip! (Tulum),"Hey everybody! I’m going to be as descriptive as I can about this in the hopes of it not being removed and actually being able to help me out. 

I have my first international solo trip coming up on May 8-16 in Tulum. Fingers crossed the virus is in a much better place by then. 

I am trying to come up with a rough itinerary on things to do and places to stay. 

I will have a rental car the entire 8 days. 

My MAIN question that is killing me, has to do with additional excursions that aren’t the easiest to do. 

I’m trying to decide if I want to take a ferry to Cozumel on my arrival day and spend 1 night there before getting to Tulum. And my second question is do I want to drive all the way down to Punta Allen and do I want to stay a night there? 

If the trip to Cozumel is suggested I was thinking of leaving my rental car in Playa del Carmen and renting a Classic Beetle to drive around the island for the day. 

The type of activities I am looking to do are more adventurous and seeing nature than spending a week on the beach. I will probably spend 1 maybe 2 days on the actually beach. 

Certain things I’m specifically looking at doing are the river float in Sian Ka’an. Going to Cenotes. A group dinner experience. Seeing Mayan ruins. Snorkeling with the sea turtles.

"Travel Middle Eastern countries with the name ""Israel"" ?","Hi guys, This is a bit of a weird question.  
I would love to experience traveling throughout the Middle East.  
My only concern is **my birth name is Israel**. I'm 100% Australian, no real connection to Israel as a country or any religious ties. (Not that it should matter anyway)  


I've heard there are quite a few countries that don't have the greatest relations with Israel.  
This begs the question, As someone whose name would be closely related to the country of Israel - Would I have any problems in certain Middle Eastern countries?  


As someone who loves all cultures, religions, and people I would absolutely love to travel to almost all of the middle eastern countries but can't shake this weird feeling I might encounter some troubles.  


(for reference, in Australia and almost every country i've been to when i mention my name people generally assume/ask if im Israeli, Muslim or Jewish)  


Thanks guys, Peace and love.",solotravel,jayjaybirdsnest
What's an European country or city to travel to that doesn't feel like Europe?,"Considering Corona is probably easing up with the rollout of vaccines within the next few months, what would be a good European country or city to visit alone, that doesn't feel like you're still in Europe? 
Been in Sweden (swede so duh), Copenhagen, Paris, London, Brussels, Gdansk and Warsaw, Rome, Naples and Pisa, Athens, Vienna and Zagreb but I always feel like I'm still in Europe :/ 

It'd be nice to not have that feeling if that makes sense? Like when traveling to the US and you see the skyscrapers and realise you're actually abroad for example. 

Due to economical reasons and just wanting a quick get away I don't think I'll want to go further than Europe once travel restrictions go away (at first anyway), in case someone wonders why it has to be in Europe.

Have you ever taken a solo photoshoot while travelling?," I think that one of the worst parts of solo travel  is being stuck with selfies.

Nowadays though there are many websites like airbnb where you can book a photoshoot in the place you're travelling to. Have you ever taken one? 

i hate looking back on a trip and not have a ""decent""  pic to show my family or friends.

Most of the time i've take them on a tripod with a self timer and they turn out okay, but i don't always feel safe to do so. It's always a risk putting your phone or expensive camera on a tripod and stand far away from it to take a picture. Anybody could snatch it off in a matter of seconds.

And photos taken by strangers.. well they are just not it

Social versus safety when traveling?,"I've been reading all these posts about people who go solo travel, meet some cool new people, go out drinking and all that stuff. the question that's been nagging at me throughout my solo traveling experiences is- How do you all balance this with safety? 

I know of somebody who went traveling, made some new friends, went out drinking with them - and woke up in a gutter with all their stuff stolen and had to get an emergency passport back to the US.

Personally when I solo travel, I pretty much have eyes in the back of my head. I do not trust random strangers who are inviting me to go check something out, and don't really care to get inebriated, because if I get drunk and in a bad situation, there's no one to come save me. Also I'm relatively lightweight.

At the same time, I feel like I've missed out on a lot of potential awesome times because of this.

Starting van or camper travel late in life?,"Ok, so I’ve never done either. Lots of tent camping as a kid. A few summer road trips sleeping in my car.  I’m planning a cross county trip,this winter. Right now the plan is Motel 6 every night. I’m wondering if I could pull it together to get a vehicle I can sleep in.  I plan to be on the road or visiting family for at least a month, so having a portable place to sleep is appealing to me. Weighing the cost of a used van/ camper and its gasoline vs hotels every night. My issue is really not so much the cost so much as Can I do it? I’m middle aged, short, not especially strong. Don’t think I manage a DIY van conversion. I think about struggling to hitch a camper to a tow. I think about a driveable RV, no towing. But that could lead to auto repair issues on the road.

Your dumbest mistake while solotravelling?,"While we shouldn't be out travelling during the pandemic so what's there to do other than sharing our brainbloopers and learning from them perhaps.


I've shared this mistake in another thread with similar theme, but oh what a costly error of thinking. 

I was finally travelling home from Southeast Asia after spending a month in Vietnam. I didn't book a flight home as I had no specific deadline other than a loosely set date. 


Browsed the web on my phone, found a reasonable price - a bit late in the night 00:10, but to save money I'm no stranger to travelling late, can even sleep on the flight so not even a bad choice after all.


So here's the fuck up, I booked the flight home for 25th of June, 00:10. Not optimal with checkout times but I figured I would just travel a day early to get closer to the airport, check into a cheap hostel. So I did, checked out from the hotel and booked a taxi to the hostel. Had a day to rest out and do literally nothing. I arrived at the airport the 25th of June around 21:50, ready for a long flight.


Made my way to the lists of flights and gates that's continously updated. Stood there like a dumb fuck staring, looking for my flight for atleast 5 minutes. Waiting to see if the rolling list was just playing a trick on my mind, making me miss my specific flight.


Eventually when looking down at my phone and checking my flight reservation I realized I had missed my fucking flight. It's about to hit 26th of June 00:10. Not only did I miss it, but I missed it by an entire day.


After sighing internally and declaring myself dumb for another solid 5 minute which felt like an hour I quickly began looking up new flights. Instead of paying 550 euros back home I'm now paying 700 euro, and not until the day after. But I'm a belief of the you live and you learn, plus I'm not by any means rich but I'm not poor either so I always budget for major fucks up like this even if it did sting like a bitch.


**tl:dr** Booked flight for 25th of June 00:10, thought this meant I could go to the airport the 25hth of June close to midnight and make my flight but obviously it's about to be 26th of June.

Taking a pet with you while going abroad,"Hi! I'm a senior in college and I recently found a stray cat and really want to keep him.

As the title suggests, I’m planning a trip to Central Asia and the Caucasus for the future.

"The pandemic is kind of like a travel ""tolerance break"". Anyone else feel they got an interestingly positive perspective reset?","Well here's my rant for the month, not really a question. I fucking hate this pandemic, and I hate being stuck domestic, but there's a tiny silver lining for me anyway. 

About a year ago,  I took my first solo trip and never looked back on whether or not I'd like the idea. I was less than a year into really moving on from domestic travel (been to most cool cities in the US) to primarily going abroad. I did as many countries in 2019 as I had in my life prior. I had a cushy remote job, which meant workations on top of good salary and paid vacations. 

Then 2 days before I am supposed to leave for Colombia, borders shut down. 

Slowly but surely I started forgetting (or becoming a bit numb to) what I loved about travel and why, I got used to not seeing and hopping on flight deals I find just because. The unknowns of solo travel started to be nerve wracking again when I contemplated future trips. 

**But.** 

Distance does make the heart grow fonder. As I look at my potential future journeys, I'm looking upon them less methodically, with a fresh set of eyes, a new sense of adventure, and in a way rediscovering why I want to see the world. 

It's not often that I get to reset that bewilderment and innocence of doing something new that I end up loving; the pandemic hitting right as I started to become semi-nomadic did give me a minute to evaluate and experience that again. It is kind of a cool feeling, to be honest.

Is it still possible to travel from continent to continent by cargo ship?,"Reading the books of such authors as Jack Kerouac or Gary Snyder (two huge solo-travel heroes of mine) it seems that traveling from, say, Europe to India by cargo ship is an incredibly cool way to do it.

Solo U.S.A. Minivan woman traveler - looking for courage / advice,"Hello! I’m new to reddit and enjoying this sub, looking for courage and advice for the next step of my heavy solo traveling life.

I’ve travelled solo since I was 21, when I went 3 weeks early to my London study abroad semester and booked a 2 wk UK tour with strangers...followed by solo trips to Ireland and Scotland, and a partly solo 5 country European tour in 9 days (lots of alone time, traveling w two near-strangers, did all the planning/routes, mainly using Rick Steve’s’ Europe Through The Back Door :). 

(Actually my FIRST time w solo travel was on a plane at 12, to Boston / Lake Winnepesaukee NH, to visit my best friend...wow just remembered that :)

Since then I’ve toured and travelled solo most my life, moved to NYC for 2 years for grad school and would take impulsive trips to Montauk or back to Chicago (near where I’m from originally), etc, joined a touring children’s theatre for 2 years and ran off on solo excursions with the van sometimes, and now, I’m a spontaneous singer-songwriter, taking nature drives and ‘songwriting adventure’ trips every month (mostly in nature since covid), and before covid, was booking frequent 4-6 day solo Midwest tours. Sometimes to based around where family lived, sometimes with strangers to play DIY basement / attic shows, developing new friendships and sleeping there, and sometimes just to get away completely solo and write songs in new places (changes in perspective help me), and in those cases, booking motel rooms or Air BnBs.

But I’m at a huge turning point and could use a pep talk lol...bought a minivan last year for touring (Sienna LE, tinted windows) and I teach piano lessons for income and currently they are all virtual and I might keep it that way permanently going forward...so I realized I could afford to travel solo a LOT more often in the future (post-covid), if I SLEPT in it! 

So far I haven’t done it, I’ve heard you can park overnight in Walmart parking lots...but I’m a little concerned about bathrooms and safety.

I’m 4’11 so comfort isn’t an issue, I’ll fit no problem...and I slept on floors on tour anyway. It’s more that I have a history of some sexual trauma so I’m less adventurous than I was around possibly unsafe things...like I wouldn’t do mixed dorms in hostels now, for instance. I’m also not sure how I’d feel parking in a secluded place...like rest stops in rural areas. BUT I dumped way too much money into cheap motels on my last cross-country trip, and I don’t want that to deter my *hopeful* (covid-wise) late 2021 adventures, sooooo...

Puerto Escondido vs Puerto Vallarta For Solo Traveler?,"Hey all,

I planned a trip to Mexico for Mid-December. I have a choice between going to Puerto Escondido or Puerto Vallarta for 7 days.

All I'm looking to do is Wake up &amp; Surf, Work from the Hostel (all I need is wifi), Eat good food (maybe cook since I like to do that) and maybe go to a few bars/restaurants/walk around the city while wearing a mask of course! I'm NOT looking to do any tours, like ziplining or rafting, nothing crazy. I'd also like to go hiking (I love waterfalls) on my day off if possible. But really surfing, food, culture and being in warm weather while I work are the reasons I'm going.

A few more details:

1. I'm a beginner/intermediate surfer, I've done a few group lessons and can stand on my own if the waves aren't too crazy. Still learning to go left/right. I'm not sure if Puerto Escondido or Puerto Vallarta is better for my skill level.
2. I've already booked a hostel at each location (I get a full refund if I cancel). The Puerto Escondido Hostel is right on Playa Zicatela while the Puerto Vallarta Hostel is a 2 min walk to Rosita Beach
3. I don't plan on renting a car, but wouldn't mind renting one for a day to go hiking in Oaxaca or up/down the Pacific coast from puerto Vallarta on my day off.
4. I have a wifi extender that I can plug into an outlet to (hopefully) increase the wifi connection. I don't have a problem working in common areas of the hostel, and I work essentially 9a-5p.

Ukraine 2020,"I wanted to share my experience traveling to Ukraine.  

I choose the country because it was open to international travelers and it was somewhere that I wouldn't normally consider.  There is an obvious language barrier.  At least in most other places in Europe they use a Latin alphabet which makes things easy.  I found that most young people spoke passible English. There is always Google Translate.  

Ukraine had resisted COVID related restrictions and just recently started to require that businesses close down at 10pm.  Some establishments are closed not because of COVID specifically but because of the economic impact of the virus on consumer spending.  

For obvious reasons the summer is the best time to visit the country.  The sunny weather allows for activities on the beach of the river Dnieper/Dnipro.  I arrived for only a couple weeks of mild weather before things got chilly.  

I got by well with a heavy thermal base layer and a sweater.  Then I bought a packable puffer jacket on Amazon.  The combo works well.  The alternative would be to invest in a fancy CanadaGoose style jacket.  Being from a warm climate I did not think that be a wise investment since I wouldn't get much use out of the heavy coat.  

Kyiv and Lviv are amazing cities.  Kyiv is the capital and the nexus of the country's airline network.  Lviv is a quaint city with a very European atmosphere.  A lot of locals think of Lviv as boring since it is such a small area but I found it to be very walkable. You can get to most places in the city center within a 15 walk.  

Uber in Ukraine is cheap.  My most expensive fare was $13 for 50 minute trip from the airport in Kyiv.  Before the advent of Uber I had previously spent $100 to get to the airport in some N. American cities.

There are plenty of excellent restaurant options in both Kyiv and Lviv.  Tinder dates are the best way to experience the dining scene.  Because of logistical complications seafood in Ukraine tends to be subpar.  I think when you freeze a good tuna steak it tends to loose a lot of flavor.  Also there is a peculiar Ukrainian style of putting cream cheese on sushi.  They often call it a Philadelphia roll.  I prefer my sushi with just sashimi and rice, but that is the local take on sushi.  

I prefer to engage with the locals rather than expats you find in the popular tourist places.  I told my dinner date how she spoke English very well.  She smiled and reminded me that ""English is an international language and you do not own it.""  I thought that was a very succinct way of putting it.  The people I meet in Ukraine where pleasant and made for interesting conversation.   

The thing I disliked about Ukraine is that you are unable to drink water from the tap.  Have you ever been stupid hungover from a night of heavy vodka drinking only to find yourself without any water.  It is a real hassle to have to lace up your boots and layer up with many articles of clothing only to stumble to the store and buy a few liters of water.  

I am glad that I travelled to Ukraine.  I would not normally consider it as a tourist destination.  I have heard good things about Georgia from many of the locals.  I am now considering flights to Tiblisi when their borders open.",solotravel,ATX-SD
What are some adventurous trips I can take starting in January?,"Here's the situation: I'm graduating college in 3 weeks and already have a job lined up for September 2021. Until then, I can do whatever I want and this is how I planned it from the beginning. I wanted to have months to explore the world and go on an adventure. I have about $20,000 saved up (currently invested but easily willing to pull out)

&amp;#x200B;

Now it's that time and covid has made me confused. I still am itching for an adventure, but I my thoughts are all over the place. Some days, I'm thinking I'll stay home and do stuff locally until a vaccine comes around, other days I'm thinking this is lame and I can't just wait around. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's a list of stuff I considered doing but haven't acted on anything yet:

\- multi-week trip to hawaii to hike and explore (I have a round trip ticket via my hawaiian airlines cc)

\- drive to Utah to go skiing with a friend of a friend who will be there

\- go to Europe May-September for backpacking

\- bike across the US (the logistics of this intimidate me, especially in the winter)

\- some combination of the above 

&amp;#x200B;

Really, I just want to do something adventurous so that I can look back on these times and think that I made the most of it. I don't want my life to be lame and I don't think I'll ever have this much time again. What would you do?

&amp;#x200B;

BTW, I am from east coast US.",solotravel,bsrbsrbrs

Chiapas/Yucatan 9 Day Itinerary - Doing too much?,"I'm planning a 9 day trip to Chiapas and the Yucatan. I'm wondering if there is too little time here to do either one well. Here's what I have planned:

Day 1 - Fly into Tuxtla Gutierrez. Stay the night in San Cristobal

Day 2 - San Cristobal

Day 3 - Yaxchilan/Bonampak

Day 4 - Palenque/Agua Azul

Day 5 - Travel to Valladolid - basically burning a day here

Day 6 - Hit a cenote, Ek Balam

Day 7 - Open/Flexible day

Day 8 - Isla Holbox beach bum

Day 9 - Isla Holbox beach bum

Day 10 - Isla Holbox beach bum

Day 11 - Fly back out of Cancun

&amp;#x200B;

Here are my concerns:

1. I'm trying to do too much and it won't be enjoyable
2. Lots of travel time between Chiapas and the Yucatan
3. If I rent a car to get around, it will be extremely expensive to rent in Tuxtla and drop it in Cancun

Here was my thinking:

1. I am very attracted to Chiapas for the jungle atmosphere. Maybe I'm glorifying it, but it sounds a bit more ""adventury""
2. Beach days are non-negotiable, however the location is. I picked Holbox because it sounds the like the least built-up/touristy beach option, but lack of good snorkeling is a major downside.

&amp;#x200B;

Random sad/crazy story,"I met a few people in Mexico and we all explored Tulum, Mexico together in my rental car.  

I left but stayed in contact with everyone through Instagram.  

When I got back to the airport my cars battery was dead, then I finally got home to find my plumbing was backing up into my sinks and shower! 

A friend messaged me seeing if I made it home alright and I explained all the stuff that happened once I arrived home and said “I feel like something really bad is gonna happen now”.  Kind of joking but had a weird feeling my “bad” night wasn’t over.  

Then one of the guys I met messaged me and said “Richie just died” Richie was another person we traveled around with.  

They went onto the roof to stargaze and one section of the roof was only plaster, the section was over the 4 flights of stairs.  Richie stepped on this section and ended up falling through.

I am thinking in take 1-3 years travelling,"Hello guys, i am thinking in travel around the world in may-jun of the next year IF the vaccine and covid are getting better. I don't know for how long my travel will be. This is part of my doubts.

I am an asian male of 25 years born and raised in Brazil.I work as a doctor and everyone says to me that i need to do my residency first ( specialize to be a cardiologist, neuro, intensivist, whatever ...) that will take me another 3 or 5 years of my life. But i am afraid of getting to old and lose part of the magic of travelling. I know that i'm still young, but i remember when i was 18 and every travel, party or food was more magic that its today.  

I am planning to stay the majority of my time in south east asia end eastearn europe because of the cost of living. I don't know much about east europe , do you guys think it's gonna be safe for asians  to travel there after covid ?  But i want to travel to other places to like china, korea, india, israel, morroco, libanon, egypty,  new zealand, australia, USA and Canada . South america i already traveled to some places and i can always go to a quicky travel of 2 weeks because of the proximity with Brazil. 

If i make  that travel this gonna blow my economies, because our money its worthing nothing in dollars right now. . But i think that our life time has no price. Do you guys think its possible to work in places like australia , new zealand , USA or europe ? ( not as a doctor, but in farms, restaurants, hostels ... )

To the others doctor in the community, do you guys think i am crazy to leave everything behind for 1 or 3 years just to travel  ?   I don't think i will have other oportunity like this in a long time. Who know if i gonna be married with kid in 5 years or become sick or another millions of thinks that can stop me from travel for so long.  

But remember when i return i will need to take my exams, study a lot to pass in the exams and if i pass i gonna need to work 60- 90 hours for week receiving 500 dollars per month as resident doctor for more 3-5 years being older and with all my friends in other stages in life . ( Yeah we receive very little in those years).

I'm sitting at the airport alone. Suddenly feeling really self conscious. Help!,"Let me begin by saying I haven't traveled anywhere in over a year. I've been working a lot and getting burnt out and felt like I ""needed to getaway"".

Last week I put in for some time off and booked a flight to Cancun. I told my dad and he was a little disappointed about my decision because of the whole covid situation. 

I told him my itinerary and that he can call me anytime. He told me to enjoy my trip. 

So I'm at the train station and I see this older couple in their late 50s having trouble navigating their way with the signs. 

They asked me which was the train going to the airport. I told them I was going there too. It turns out they're on the same flight as me. 

They said they wanted to follow my lead and we talk on the train for a bit on our way there. We get there and check in. I was still getting my ticket and they said they would go to the gate first. 

I said I'd meet them there. I get my ticket and get past the gates. I decide to get something to eat. I see them at the next table but I didn't want to intrude. I just wave and we say hi. 

Afterward, I go and sit near the gate when all of a sudden it hits me - I'm all by myself. 

Now I've always traveled alone. I've been close to 20 countries all alone. I've never felt so self conscious as I do right now. 

It's like you feel lonely and desperate for some type of companionship. 

I'm sure I'll meet some awesome people at my hostel like I always do but as for right now, holy shit. 

This sucks. Maybe I jumped the gun. Maybe I shouldn't have booked this trip.

"Any advice, suggestion, or tips for a solo female traveler in Europe?","Hello, I’m 24F and I’m planning to tour around Europe when this pandemic is over. I have always dreamed of traveling to Europe alone (because honestly, I want to have a soul-searching/finding-myself experience). The past two years have been very difficult for me as I have experienced big changes in my life: being diagnosed with depression and anxiety, leaving law school, and ending a relationship—all of which led me to believe that I truly need and deserve to travel for myself and by myself.

Experiences of Black women traveling solo in Italy,"My first solo trip was a couple years back. I spent three weeks in Europe and travelled mostly in France and Italy. I loved Paris. Now, I'm a black woman and my friends had told me Italy was amazing, specifically the larger cities. I actually expected more racism in Paris by reputation, but I never had one bad experience there. I travelled by train from Paris to Milan and that was the start of the longest ten days of my life. It was a NIGHTMARE. Seeing as this was my first solo trip and I knew nothing, I had two huge suitcases. I get off the Metro at Duomo, knowing I could get a taxi to my nearby Air BNB. Massive mistake. It was July, the sun was beating down full force and empty taxi after empty taxi passed me by as I was flagging them down. At first, I chalked it up to the size of my bags, my youth, anything and everything. After close to an hour,  I even left my bags in an alcove so I could just jump in front of the next empty taxi I saw and make them take me. (I was standing in front of a traffic light, so they had to stop). I was ignored and batted away.  Finally, a kind trans person came out of a local business and called me a private taxi. That's the service I used the rest of my time in Milan, I never could get a cab just by hailing there. And I didn't have phone service so I couldn't use Uber or Lyft. I've never been so aware of my color in all my life. I'm a 450 in Fenty, cocoa girl and I had long faux locs for traveling convenience. I was staying in a residential area of Milan and people would literally stare at me when I walked down the street. 

A lot of it was racism but some of it was xenophobia against the African immigrants there. When I wore any kind of American paraphernalia I was treated WAYYYYYYY better. I moved onto Rome quickly. It was better but still awful. I'll just never know what percentage was racial. One night, I went to a ballet at La Scala and bumped into some white American tourists. And they told me about how badly they were treated as tourists! Some of what they said sounded very familiar. That leg of trip wasn't all bad. I did some great shopping, had the best gelato ever, saw the Vatican, enjoyed the Eternal City. But I don't know if I'll ever go back, not even for Venice or Naples. I felt so isolated and unsafe. Has anyone experienced this? Any suggestions?

UPDATE: Wow! I did not expect such a response. I really appreciate everyone’s feedback. Everyone who explained Milan’s taxi situation, you helped me see the whole experience from a different angle. I was in Paris for two weeks before I went to Milan, and I hailed cabs all the time-but I was also right down the street from the Luxembourg Gardens, so I’m sure there were an abundance to be had. I stayed in Trastevere in Rome, so I could walk a lot or take trams and buses. And when I would come home from attractions, I would automatically use the taxi stands, so I never really put any of that together before about the taxis in Milan. I’d always wanted to go to Italy so badly and I was disappointed when I did. So I’m grateful to everyone who suggested ways I could take back the experience or navigate similar situations more safely. I’m glad I posted here. The experience was always such a weight on me. I never talked about it with my family because they hadn’t wanted me traveling solo anyway and I didn’t want to give them any ammunition. I feel like I could give Italy a second chance now, but even if I never do, I feel cleansed of the original experience. Now that I’ve talked out the negative, I can just remember the positive, those beautiful sunsets, those lovely narrow streets, and the best gelato I’ve ever had.

Experience as a white guy in Colombia,"So for background: I’m a tall (6’4) German/Nordic looking white dude (If you want, you can see photos in my post history lol)    

Currently in Colombia for a month-long vacation. My experience in Bogotá has been completely awesome, cheap excellent food, interesting culture, so much to see and do..  

That being said, the amount of staring I get is crazy!   
I’m talking almost everybody I pass. At the very least, I get a curious glance, but more often than not it’s a full on, stop what they’re doing and stare situation. I should add it’s not unpleasant or hostile staring. More like very curious looks.    

I get it, I’m white, blondish and tall in a country of darker skin tones, black hair and (for the most part) shorter folks.

Renting out a house while travelling,"I'm currently living with Parents (in UK) and considering buying a house and going travelling.

I have supportive parents who encourage this idea, saying that they will manage the tenants when I'm away, however my main concern would be that I struggle to find tenants, or that the mortgage that I pay would be a lot more expensive than the rent I receive from the tenants.

On the difficulty of crossing busy roads without cross-walks,"I have been pondering, as I have been watching travel videos and planning lovely future-tense vacations, where the hardest places to simply cross the road are?

**Nothing brings me more stress than a difficult-to-cross road.** It was a deal-breaker for me in much of Vietnam, as I stood, my entire body hairs upright, bracing to cross several times a day for three weeks, and I would find my nervous system so aggravated by just trying to cross the road that I would spend my nights inside in defeat. I was in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, Hue, Hoi An, and Can Tho, and other than Hoi An, every city was terrifying to cross at many intersections. Fastforward to Phnom Penh, and I loved it, in retrospect I think because I walked the corniche so often, although I once found myself again unable to cross a sea of motorcycles again at rush hour and wound up finally biding time in a store for an hour because I could not figure out how to cross the street -- even with locals -- without having a sort of sense of nervous collapse.

I have been to Istanbul, a city of 20 million or so, and walked across a freeway once when lost, and did not feel at all anxious. So it's not only the number of people out, but also, how they drive.

Since we can reflect now, and it has come to mind as I watch videos of Cairo, where it looks like Ho Chi Minh City all over again but cars, I find myself thinking, ""I don't want to ever go there"" or ""I'd go straight to Luxor, which could not be that bad! Nothing could be THAT bad, right?"" I'd probably stay in Giza and ask if I could ride a camel to the pyramids and sphinx, from the hotel, lol!

**I'm curious about three things now:**

* 1.) does anyone else just sometimes avoid traveling to places where they feel anxious about being run-over while crossing the street, not because they have unreasonable anxiety issues but because it's just hard? Do you find it kind of wrecks your whole day and you wind up trying to take cabs (that's what I did in Vietnam, and I am not a big fan of cabs for short distances -- I love walking the city streets!)
* 2.) Where does the good people of this subreddit think the world's hardest cities to just cross the streets are, based on personal experience, and why?
* 3.) (Optional) -- for anyone who has been to either Ho Chi Minh City or Hanoi (or similar) --AND--  Cairo, or any other Egyptian cities, how did they compare? That's a kind of passing curiosity now.

Thanks for your replies! Seeking future-chill travel which doesn't make my hair stand on end and leave me curled up in a ball in my guesthouse for the rest of the day after a one-hour excursion. But moreso, I just have not seen it discussed before, and I can't be the only person who thinks of the world in terms of ""streets that seem legit"" and ""streets that scare me completely.""",solotravel,the_latest_greatest
Where to go?,"I’m 25F and I’m super burned out and stress from work. I am looking to travel next year around February, assuming the borders are open already and COVID is cancelled.

Thank goodness I was able to leave the US before my country went lockdown. I’m from the Philippines btw.

I'm considering spending most of my time in Morro de Sao Paulo, Floripa, Rio (Carnaval will probably be cancelled like Festa Junina was, huh?) and/or Curitiba. Also interested in seeing Iguaçu, Pantanal, and Jalapão (maybe as long-weekend trips). I will almost definitely be back in Brazil after COVID, so if there's anything that will likely be difficult or pointless to try to do/see now, I can plan to do so later.
* I have friends in Salvador and intend to spend time at the end of the trip with them there, and will visit Chapada Diamantina with them

Specifically looking for guidance on where you recommend I stay for month-long (or so) periods, considering access to activities due to COVID, internet, etc. Thanks in advance for your help! Respostas em português tb são bem vindas!",solotravel,MrLostValley
"Trying to figure out transportation in Egypt (ferries, trains). Also, please help with itinerary.","Public transportation in Egypt seems to be quite complicated. I have read that certain trains (or compartments) are accessible only for Egyptian nationals and that as a foreigner, you have to book a more expensive luxury compartment (for example for going from Cairo to Luxor).

The same for ferries. I looked into the one from Hurghada to Sharm, and the price is way more expensive for tourists. 

Is there any way to avoid these restrictions and get normal train (and maybe ferry) tickets in Egypt? Is just buying the ticket once you are already on the train a viable option?

I wan to see the following places: 

- Cairo
- Luxor
- Aswan
- Dahab
- Mt. Sinai
- Maybe Alexandria 
- Maybe Abu Simpel

I am flying either into Hurghada or Sharm. If it is the latter, I guess it would be a good idea to start my trip in Dahab and spend one or two weeks there. But actually, I wanted to save Dahab for last, because otherwise I fear I might get ""stuck"" there and spend my whole month there lol.

So my question is this: How can I get from Hurghada to Cairo the cheapest way possible? I have looked into it, but couldn't find any options.

&gt; I know about Go-Bus. But is it possible to catch so-called local buses in Egypt, where you just show up at the bus station and get on the next bus to anywhere? Like it works in India, for example...

I don't want to take any flights.

Also, can you recommend any other places worth seeing in Egypt? I want to avoid resort towns like Sharm. I am interested in Ancient Egyptian History, Islamic history, laid-back places like Dahab...

I am 21, male, from the EU, I have been to countries such as India and Pakistan before, so I know my way around touts, pushy vendors, shitty buses etc. 

Thanks! Looking forward to hearing any advice.",solotravel,HitchhikingToNirvana
Destination recommendations for December 2021,"With the vaccine news looking promising, I'm starting to plan a 3 week trip that had been previously postponed for sometime in December 2021. Problem is, I don't really know where I want to go. 

* 32F likely to be traveling solo for most of the 3 weeks, so safety will be important. I'm comfortable traveling solo to big cities like NYC, but not as experienced with international solo travel. 
* I would like to spend a portion of the time relaxing in some sort of tropical/beach climate at a nice resort/hotel. 
* Generally more interested in cultural things (museums, food, attractions) than hiking, camping, etc. 
* Budget is not a factor. I am receiving a stipend from my employer that will provide $2,300 (plus flight costs), and I've been saving up for quite some time so I'm also willing to go into my own pocket to make it a memorable trip.

Quit job and move to West Africa - dumb move?,"Hi, I am the son of immigrants, and am considering moving to my parent's country for a year or so to travel, learn the local language and find volunteer opportunities. I am 26M, working in an investment bank (\~180k-200k total compensation yearly), but I am bored of the work, am not learning what I want to anymore, and I want to pursue this passion I have had since I was a kid. I am aware that I am earning a large salary for my age, and many people (especially my parents) are telling me to ride this for a few years and build savings. However, I have completely lost interest in my work and have refocused on working in economic development instead. This is also why I think this move could be beneficial. I am looking to spend most of my time in Senegal, but will probably spend time in the Ivory Coast. I will have access to family, so I will not be totally lonely.  I will probably spend a year total on the continent before going to grad school.

Looking to spend a few months in the UK in the new year,"Hey all, bit of a wall of text incoming. 

29M from Canada here looking for a bit of advice or perspective. At the beginning of 2020 I got my 2 year tier 5 yms visa for the UK (valid until January 2022) with the plan to spend the next year or 2 traveling around the uk, working odd jobs and whatnot to support myself. Pretty standard I think. I flew over at the beginning of February and spent about a month there before COVID shut everything down and I decided to play it safe and come back home. Covid completely shut down my industry (live entertainment) so I've been here for the past few months working customer service jobs and whatnot to try and get some savings back but I feel like I'm kind of just wasting time at the moment, waiting for things to open back up (who isn't though). I'm also having a hard time letting the visa go to waste so I've been thinking of heading back in January/February and trying to make a go of it again for a few months at least or until things start to hopefully open up back home. 

So despite Covid I'm curious if anyone here has any suggestions about things to do or places to see in a Covid uk, considering I imagine most things will remain closed for the majority of this year or until a vaccine becomes more widespread. Big fan of the outdoors and just looking to explore and take in as much culture as I can given the situation. I'll likely start around London but from there who knows, I'm open to going wherever.

I understand this may come off as a bit tone-deaf/privileged given everything going on in the world at the moment but I'm just trying to make the best sense out of my situation and options.

Any feedback's appreciated, even just telling me it's still a horrible idea after all lol, as I'm still just brainstorming ideas right now before actually committing and booking anything. 

Thanks for reading and hopefully everyone's staying safe!

- No direct routes from Budapest &amp; Belgrade and vice versa

- No direct routes from Zagreb to Belgrade and vice versa

- Balkan train companies are limited

USEFUL TIP WHILE PLANNING A SAFARI TO TANZANIA,"Just thought I could share with youse this information.

One the things you need to know while planning your safari to Tanzania, East Africa is ""Time to travel""

Here is the months breakdown which I thought could be helpful for someone to decide when to travel.

Tanzania Seasons: 

January to February: It is normally dry and hot. It is the calving season for the wildebeests so the  wildebeests will be at Southern part of Serengeti,  Ndutu area. Though February is the only time of the year which is guranteed to see the big herds all together move to South of Serengeti for calving. 
Easier to spot wildlife. 
Good time for birds watching since migratory birds are present.

March, April &amp; May, this is peak of wet season. Grasses becomes green and beautiful. Rains may interfere your trip,  parks are less crowded, low rates applies. Animals including the wildebeests which are famous for migration are more dispersed.

June: It is a transitional period from rain season to dry season. Grassess become green. The wildebeets start moving from Central to North Serengeti. Migration can be seen in the Western corridor of Serengeti until July.

July to October: It is dry season in Tanzania, Mostly sunny. Morning and nights get cold. From August to Sept the great heards of wildebeests and Zebras move from Northern Serengeti to Maasai Mara by crossing Mara River,  Easy to spot animals because grasses will be grazed by hebivores and also most of animals concentrates around waterholes. It is quite crowded around Seronera area in Serengeti. High season rates applies.

November to December: It is short rain season though it is still not bad to come. The grasses becomes green and beautiful.

All in all, there is no bad time to visit Tanzania, Africa beacause each month has it's own uniqueness.",solotravel,glory1812
Being Realistic,"Alright, hear me out, this might be a strange one.

Ever since I've (20f) been 16 and watched Karl Watson's HK2NY, a bit of a desire to start travelling has morphed into a true, full-blown obsession. I've done a mass interrailing trip when I finished school, went around Italy for 3 weeks last year and had planned for Greece this summer but obviously, that didn't go ahead. Anyways this obsession has been completely tempted by fate due to me being a planner so last Christmas I had started planning a trip for 2022 - commencing 20th July to hit the Banana Pancake Trail, Oceania and finishing off in the US with Hawaii, San Fran and LA.

When I tell you I've planned it - I have planned it to an inch of its life (yes, I understand the appeal to not booking things for after a month of the travel you have planned but I mean to go to quite a few events before I hit Bondi Beach on Christmas Day so I have to keep to a schedule in order to do the things I want to do) so I know where I'm going, the dates I'll be there, how I'm getting there, how much it would be to get there, the hostel I'm staying at, how much the hostel would be per night and per stay with a few activities thrown in and what visa sort documents I need to enter every country.

When girls say all they wanna do is marry and have babies, this trip for around 10-11 months is all I want to do - and it's all I need to do as well. However, in this context of COVID-19, I'm trying to remain optimistic but how hopeful would a trip like this be?

Leaving July 2022 and hitting Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and the US.

Would this trip be viable to happen then (we're talking about with all the events going full blast as well, Full Moon Party, Christmas and NYE on Bondi etc.) or will I have to postpone it by a year?

TL;DR: Have planned the entirety of an 11 month trip to SE Asia, Oceania, and US. Would it be responsible/viable/able to go ahead?",solotravel,Ketamine_Crazywhoop

Should I quit my job and travel for a bit after COVID?,"Hi everyone, a bit about me, I am a 26F from the US. I am currently working as an accountant in the federal government level, which means my job is BORINGGGGG and I am craving some excitement out of my life. I just bought my own home and own my car(no car payments). I recently had a whole change of personal life, where I had my heart broken by my ex fiancé and now kind of want to do what I’ve always wanted to do without having someone hold me back and that’s travel for more than just a few weeks. I would like to do it for 3+ months, even a year if I could. I do make decent money, 60k a year and have a really great job. However, I feel like because I don’t have any kids, and am young still, this is the time to do it. I’ve always wanted to but growing up in poverty I’ve always wanted to be stable as well and I’m scared that if I do this, I’ll regress. However, this has always been a dream of mine and I kind of want to bite the bullet. Especially right now with covid, I’ll be able to save up for it and plan it well.

Spent a month traveling the western US with my dog Kingston- Itinerary,"Back in September I asked about secret spots and great backcountry camping sites west of the Mississippi. I’ve got a post trip update of what happened and where I went! [Photos!](https://imgur.com/gallery/xCmmNRF)

Days 1-3 Holly Springs NF, Mississippi

I left home in Indiana to drive straight south to Mississippi, after stopping off at bass pro in Nashville for last minute things. Muggy, buggy, beautiful. Couldn’t light a fire for the life of me with how wet and wild the wood was. Surprised we didn’t end up with ticks after 3 days there, but we spent time hiking along cotton fields and plenty of small lakes. 

Day 4 Driving across Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas

Spent the night along a truck pull off just east of the NM border

Days 5-10 Carson National Forest NM

I only planned for 3 days in Carson, but the landscape kept me there for 5. I stayed in the Valle Vidal region the entire time, hiking to a new spot every night. I was drastically unprepared for how cold the mountains could get but we survived with a few extra layers at night (I forgot to take a pic of Kingston in a sweatshirt but rest assured he was warm and goofy looking). We were surrounded by cattle and elk most of the time, great bear prevention I’m sure. Trout streams popped here and there, and with my trusty fishing license and collapsible pole we had trout for dinner once which was messy and a pain but so delicious. 

Day 11 Driving to Painted Desert, AZ

Spent the night in my car at the Painted Desert after watching the sun go down across the canyon. Dinner was couscous on the gas stove followed by a treacherous walk along the rim taking photos and warning Kingston to not jump into the void for a stick.

Day 12 Driving to the Chaco Canyon

We (I) needed a shower so we stayed in the local Motel 6. 

Day 13 Chaco Canyon and driving to the Grand Canyon
 
Chaco Canyon was mostly closed trail wise but we were able to walk to the archaeological site to see the Petroglyphs and remains of civilization. Continued on to the Grand Canyon where I didn’t have the foresight to request a back country camping permit 6 months in advance so yet another motel 6 in my favorite city so far, Flagstaff!

Night 13 Flagstaff

I am in love with this city. Nestled between two national forests with a bustling night life, it is everything I have dreamed of in terms of settling down. Stopped by 3 different dog friendly breweries, Wanderlust Brewing Co, Hops on Birch, and Mother Load Brewing Co. All three were dog friendly and had incredible brews.

Day 14-15 The Grand Canyon

We spent two days hiking the trails in the Grand Canyon, day one we hiked the south rim and Bright Angel Point. Day two we hiked the Hermit trail to both Santa Maria Spring and Dripping Springs. Beautiful hikes, very steep, and little water. Kingston was a rockstar and carried his own water in his backpack, he deserved the second bed at the motel after both nights. 

Day 16-19 San Juan NF CO (Durango)

San Juan NF was lush and green. We camped for 3 days between Madden Peak, Baldy Peak, and Silver Mountain. The campgrounds were packed tight but we were able to find a secluded point with only a few neighbors. 

Day 20-22 Bonneville Salt Flats and Antelope Island SP, UT

We spent two nights on the salt flats watching motocross and dune buggies in the Knolls recreation area. Before leaving the next day we drove across the GSL to Antelope Island to check out the “water” and saw a few Buffalo and a lot of brine shrimp/salt flies. 

Day 23-25 Teton NF Wyoming

We saw a few key spots in Teton, hiking around Jenny Lake was the precipice. 

Days 26-30 Yellowstone NP, Wyoming

I needed to check this off my bucket list, walked along the Upper Geyser Basin, saw the Mammoth Hot Springs, Fountain Paint Pot, the Grand Prismatic Spring, Old Faithful, and the Grand Canyon of Yellowstone. We hiked the Mud Volcano Trail, Waipiti Lake Trailhead, and Seven Mile Hole Trailhead. We were lucky to find a spot to camp within Yellowstone and reserved it for the 3 nights it took to see as much as possible.

After Yellowstone, we drove back home to Indiana through South Dakota, seeing Mount Rushmore, Minnesota and Wisconsin, stopping at a few creameries for cheese and ice cream, and drove straight through Illinois to home. It was an adventure I’d love to do again, and it’s spurred my interest in Van Life and Tiny Home living.",solotravel,georampage

Dealing with loneliness while traveling,"So I have been in Costa Rica solo traveling for about a month now, and the feeling of loneliness is really starting to creep in. I am enjoying the trip and there is nowhere else I would rather be for the next 6 months, but i am finding making friends to be really difficult. I have lived in Costa Rica before when I was little, and I had plenty of friends. But when you are a kid making friends is as easy as just having toys and being a similar age. Now I am 18 and I am finding it very difficult to connect with anyone. The local girls (ticas) are not a fond of white girls, so I am having a hard time meeting girls my age. The boys here (ticos) are very pushy and pretty much are only looking for romance because the stereotype is white girls are rich and easy. I am going to be living predominately in the same town for the 6 months, so I am hoping to make a little bit of a community. But the community is very tight and very cliquey. There are the resort owners, surfers, hippies, expats and the Costa Rican locals, but I don't fit into any of them. So I am just wondering how you guys have dealt with loneliness while traveling before? And if you have any tips on how to speed up the friend making process?",solotravel,emily_adams123

Need advice about touring the West Coast/South West in US,"Hi,

To give some background about myself: I am a brown guy in his late 20s that has been living in the United States for more than 5 years now. Using a throwaway account because my some people irl know what my primary reddit account is and I do not want them reading this post.

Due to the culture and the very abusive environment that I was brought up in, I have never been able to have a lot of meaningful relationships, not in my native country and not since I have moved to the United States, which means that I like to travel alone and I mostly keep to myself. You maybe wondering what that has to do with my post on this sub, but I'm getting to it.

One of the very few people that I can say that truly always had my best interests at their heart and have always supported me to the best of their abilities (and financially supported me when I had to move to the US) lives back in my native country. That person is going through some pretty serious health issues right now and they need someone to support them. I couldn't just leave them to their devices in these tough times, so I have made the very hard decision to move back home to support them. I have already put in my notice at my current job (which ends in 3 weeks), and since I am here on an employment based Visa right now, I have 2 months to leave the US and would ideally like to leave around the New year's day.

I have spent most of my time in the United States working and traveling in the South and the East Coast and I feel that I have explored as many places as I could in these parts of the US, so there are no regrets there. But one significant regret I have is that I've never really had the chance to  explore much of the west coast or the South West (besides a trip to Vegas where I unfortunately spent most of my time on the strip in the Casinos), so I would really like to visit these places before the end of this year. My budget is up to $7000 (for motels and rental cars) but I am not entirely sure on what places I should visit and where I should start and end my trip and where I would stay if I were to make this trip (and how suitable the weather conditions are). I've always found the pics with nothing but the desert on both sides of the road in Nevada and Arizona highly fascinating and have always wanted to drive around on those roads. I also have a motorcycle license and would love to ride on those roads but I am not sure if it is as easy to get a motorcycle rental as it is to get a car rental (and how safe/expensive it would be).

Assuming that I have 4 days off for the Thanksgiving weekend and 3 weeks between the 11th of December - 1st of January, what places would you recommend if I want to travel the West coast and the South West alone? I have heard that the drive from Oregon - California is very beautiful and is adjacent to a beach, so I would like to cover too that if possible. I would also like to make a trip to the Grand Canyon but I don't know if this is the right season for that. I am feeling even more clueless than I would have in normal times due to the pandemic and the potential lockdown in California. So any advice you would have for me that would help me in doing one or more of the following things would be highly appreciated.

1. Ride a Motorcycle/Drive a Car around in Nevada/Arizona desert area
2. Make the beautiful drive from Oregon - California
3. Visit the Grand Canyon
4. Stops at any other national parks/places with amazing views

I apologize for any incorrect assumptions I made in this post. I have mostly relied upon what people have told me and what I found on some blogs to form my opinion about the places I mentioned above, so I could be wrong in some cases. I am not sure if I will get the chance to visit the United States again, so I would like to make the most of what little time I have left here and visit as much of the western part of this country as I can before I leave. Thank you for taking the time to read this far into the post :)

"If you were a betting redditor, based off of everything we know with the incoming vaccines, how long it could take for global immunity (enough for travel to be safe again anyway), when would you guess that we'll be able to safely and freely solo travel again?","*tl;dr The title, essentially*

I wanted to discuss with fellow solo travelers who I feel must've had this thought come up. 

Last year I graduated and got a job in January that comes with 2 weeks (80 hours) PTO. As a result I immediately started to plan my next trip for March-April 2021 so I could revisit Japan (and a few other countries) during cherry blossom season. Then Covid hit and destroyed that dream, however I still want to travel the moment Covid is a thing in the past. I'm so starved for traveling that I started willingly started working extra hours during certain holidays (Like Indigenous Peoples' Day) when we would otherwise have off to acquire comp time so I could have 3-3.5 weeks of vacation when Covid ends and really make up for lost time.

Now here's where the question comes from. My job doesn't let me rollover PTO, so as a result I need to take some soon. I made an excel sheet where I put in a planned date to determine how many PTO hours I can use prior to that date to avoid not accumulating PTO but still reach max PTO by the time it's travel time. Example, if I take off 2 days in December, I will max back out around April, and 4 days means I'll max back out in June. Give or take.

As a result I've been doing some kind of pre-planning and guessing on when travel will be back to normal. As wishful thinking as it would be, I don't think March-April would be back to normal (which saddens me as I really want to see the cherry blossoms, but I'm also a hypochondriac so it wouldn't even be a fun trip for that reason), so I currently have put June as my more somewhat realistic date. Of course if that doesn't appear to be the case, I'll just adjust accordingly in regards to my PTO and such.

With that in mind, if you were to make a guess, what month (god forbid year) would you think the world would be ready for risk-free travel again? I'm just curious on what other solo travelers specifically think, because I feel like y'all may better understand the reasons why I'm so starved to travel again. Doing whatever I want, getting away from it all, making new friends, with no responsibility for anyone else but yourself. You could say I'm having withdrawals. My friends generally travel with family and other friends so they don't really understand the sense of pure freedom that I miss so much.

First Solo Trip - Across the US,"Hey guys! I’m (22 F) sure a question along this vein has been asked before, but I wanted to get other people’s opinions. I’m graduating this December and I am planning on moving to Berlin next August for my masters. This gives me a pretty large amount of free time. I’ve saved up quite a bit of money, and wanted to do a road trip across the US before I leave. I don’t have anyone that could really do it with me, and I plan on probably sleeping in my car for a lot of it (my back windows are tinted in my Honda CRV). My dad is very against it, is saying that a lot of things could go wrong. I’ve traveled a lot around the world but usually with said dad, and I’ve never done a trip by myself. There are so many things I want to see before I leave, and although I’m quite independent, I have never had to deal with things that can go wrong on the road (like car trouble, etc). I am also worried about the concept of being a young woman traveling alone. Opinions on any of this?",solotravel,poofity-passington
Contiki... will I be considered old at 26?,"I previously did two trips with Trek America when I was 23 and 24 and was pretty much the bang average age both times with those groups. 

Obviously I haven’t been able to travel this year so looking at booking for next year and as Trek have closed I’ve been looking at Contiki however I have read a few things that make me worry I’ll be with a huge group of 18-21 year olds and be the odd one out as I will be 26 by then.

Advice on how to get money in Ghana?,"Hey guys, this is probably a stupid question but I have no idea how money transaction works abroad because I have never travelled internationally before.

&amp;#x200B;

I am planning a trip to Ghana in 2021, and am confused on how I will get money over there. I know you can exchange cash at the airport, but I would rather not carry a huge amount of cash on me for safety reasons. I have read that visa cards are the most widely accepted in Ghana. Does that mean I can just buy like the $100 prepaid visa cards that you can find in Walmart and use that? Again, I feel like I sound totally dumb, but I really don't understand how this works.

Should I just use cash instead the whole time?",solotravel,CarefulProcedure4

Solo Travelled Brazil (Oct-Nov 2020),"I went on a 2 Week Trip to Brazil from the US from late October and early November. I plan on describing my experience, tips, how I did concerning security, COVID, my hostel experience, and any other relevant information.

Background information on myself so you can get an idea of who I am:

\- Male, 28 years old, average build but with a NY-resting bitch face and walking speed/gait so I can at times dissuade randoms from talking to me. I have solo travelled previously. FIRST TIME to Brazil and South America

\- English: Native / Spanish: Native / Portuguese: Intermediate-High (obvious accent)

\- Brazil Solo Travel Requirement: I'd say Intermediate-Easy. If you've solo'd to Mexico, Turkey or Egypt, you're more than ready. 

Quick Notes for the TL;DR crew:

\- Would I recommend: Yes. Very much so. Highly recommend. 

\- Currency Conversion: Very good, USD is strong.

\- Places visited: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro

\- COVID: Everywhere I went people were very cautious of their surroundings, nearly everyone used a mask, social distancing was hard in some locations but for the most part noticeable measures were taken. Unfortunately, much like most of Latin America, COVID and its outbreaks is highly correlated with one's socioeconomic status.

\- Safety: I personally believe everything I read previously on reddit and other places were exaggerated. This is not to say that you shouldn’t take the smart skills and tips provided to make the informed and preventative measures. I always placed my iPhone 11 Max Pro (whatever it's called) in my front pocket, or my small should fanny pack thing, always had my money clip in front pocket too. (Regardless of travelling or not, you should always keep your wallet in your front pocket). 

I personally never saw anyone get mugged, or felt threatened; I did see some sketchy teens near the historical areas in São Paulo, but you can spot them from afar and they just give off a vibe that they're up to no good. They're not violent though, they're just skulking around, some are clearly high.  Just keep your eyes peeled for anything sus and always look far ahead to prevent anything, and look like you know where you're going and doing. They know when people aren't from there, but if you look unbothered and stern they won't even approach you. It's a bit easier to keep your distance from people due to COVID. If someone does come up and tries to pitch you a sale or something just politely extend your arm and say ""não obrigado"" (no thanks). 

In Rio I took my phone to the beach despite everyone's caution. I never took it out around the bike lanes, however you can see other Brazilians and locals jog up and down the bike lanes with their lastest phones, airpods and other gadgets. I didn't want to tempt that. I would only take my phone out on the shoreline, always after checking my surroundings. If you get a beach seat and beach umbrella from those beach vendors then you can near-worry-free use your phone and take all the selfies you want. I went to the beach with random hostel people (all Brazilians) and we had no issue whatsoever. We would take turns keeping watch on our stuff. We did ask a large group next to us if they could keep an eye on our stuff, they were very willing and even suggested we move our things into the middle of their friend circle so they could properly watch it. 

&amp;#x200B;

São Paulo: I did all the major touristy things from wikitravel, youtube videos, and random blogs.

\- Hostel: Brazilodge Hostel and Hotel in Vila Mariana. Clean hostel, nice staff. Due to COVID many young Brazilian professionals come and go through there, met many recently graduated professionals. Brazilians are very kind and intrigued to meet new people and especially foreigners. This is an upper middle class neighborhood, very clean, very safe. You can see young ladies walk and talk on their phones without worry, teens biking around with their iWatches, and people at night without a worry. 

\- Metro: Extremely efficient, clean, and very safe. The moment people pass the turnstiles people use their phones without a care in the world, on the platform and on the train itself. If you've been to NY, London or Paris than mastering this metro system will take about a whole 10 minutes. I never used the bus, mostly because I hate busses and also because of COVID. 

\- Tinder: Safe, never met anyone sus or trying to scam you. Love motels in Brazil are amazing. $50 for 12 hours gets you a pool, jacuzzi, waterfall shower and a free meal.

\- Uber: Safe, everyone I met was 4.85+ rating. They recently implemented new measures to stamp out any creeps and to make solo women feel safer and have easier means to report any scumbags. 

\- Restaurants: HIGHLY RECOMMEND: Rodizio de Sushi, omfg best thing ever. Never had a bad food experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Rio: I did take a bit more security measures as most people kept saying it was more dangerous. Honestly the Ipanema area is very safe, much safer than Copacabana in my opinion, but even then I didn't feel like people were being robbed and kidnapped at every corner. Walked around with my phone in my pocket and used it freely inside stores, restaurants and cautiously on the street. 

\- Hostel: Mango Tree Hostel. Toilets and showers could be cleaner, but it's worth the money. Great place to meet other travellers, friendly people, lots of locals, good amount of foreigners despite COVID. The very few other foreigners were also versed travellers. 

\- Beach: Ipanema beach is much better than Copacabana, fewer people, less beach vendors, less randos and sus people. All the beach vendors that do approach are polite and aren't harassing, they just quickly pitch their sale and if you politely say 'no thanks' or look but say you're no interested in the moment they'll be on their way. Don't be dick, they're people just trying to make a living. Be nice to them, they're nice to you so it's the least you can do. Some actually have good stuff. The beach seats and umbrella are about R$30 for both for unlimited amount of time. Settle on price prior to sitting. 

Public Transport: I didn't ride any, the uber's were cheap enough, I did walk around with another American aimlessly throughout the southern part of Rio, no problem whatsoever, pretty chill. 

Safety: I felt as though it was ever so slightly more dodgy than São Paulo but nothing like the fear-mongering that many other places would describe it as. I took my phone everywhere, to the beach, the streets, on the ubers, to the tourist attractions, etc. 

I dislike Copacabana, 100% preferred Ipanema beach, the vibe is different more welcoming less commercial, less tourist trap, more authentic. Also on Ipanema the vendors are more laid back and slightly cheaper. All of Rio is gay friendly, but Ipanema has a ""spot"" for LBGT+ people, they may ask you to watch their stuff, it's kind of rule of thumb to watch other people's stuff as they'll watch your stuff too if you ask, scratch my back I'll scratch yours type of thing. I also felt safer taking my phone our and taking photos on Ipanema. It's more of a gut feeling, and never ignore your gut.

Tinder: A bit more shallow people, but just as safe. Good food, people are always nice too.

Summary: I would definitely go again, thoroughly enjoyed my time, didn't have a single issue, met tons of people, great sushi.",solotravel,Marco_Tarik92

Help with SEA Itinerary,"Hello everyone! 

The only thing keeping me sane lately is diving into planning trips and one that I've really, really been looking forward to is Southeast Asia. I know this is a great place for solo backpackers to embark on first-time longer trips, so want to travel there first! I've done solo trips but my longest is only three months, with a friend joining me for the last month, and I'm hoping to spend 4 to 5 months in SEA. Below is my rough itinerary, in the order that I would be doing the travelling. 

Thailand: Bangkok - Sukhothai - Chang Mai (&amp; Mae Hong Loop)

Myanmar: Bagan, Inle Lake, Shwedagon Pagoda, Golden Rock

Back into Thailand: Pai &amp; Chiang Rai

Laos: Luang Prabang - Nong Khiaw - Muang Ngoi - Vang Vieng - Vientiane

Vietnam: Hanoi - Sapa - Ha Long Bay - Optional Adventure: The Ha Giang Loop – 3 Days - Phong Nha National Park - Hue - Hoi An - Dalat - Mui Ne - Ho Chi Minh City

Cambodia: Phnom Penh - Kep - Kampot - Koh Rong - Siem Reap 

Southern Thailand: Bangkok - Surat Thani -  Kho Phangan - Koh Tao - Khao Sok National Park - Krabi- Phi Phi Islands - Railay and Ton Sai - Koh Lipe

Malaysia: Langkawi - Penang - Taman Negara - Cameron highlands - Kuala Lumpur 

Singapore (only 2-3 days here)

Indonesia: Bali, Mount Bromo, Borneo, Komodo Islands, Sumatra, Lombok 

**My main questions are:** Would you add or leave out anything from this itinerary? How long do you think it'll take to do this realistically? (I'm a medium-paced traveler, I can stay in some places for 3 days and others for a week if I really like them, so it usually balances out). How much would you budget for this kind of trip?

Was there anything you did / saw / place you stayed at in SEA that you would say is a must do?

"cancelled ticket, so dreaming of where to go with my mass amount of flight points!","With hopes of the vaccine being accessible by spring-summer next year, I've started thinking about places to go once life starts to go back to normal.

Any suggestions for a 3 month long trip? Can I do Europe and SEA in that time?,"Hi guys. Assuming the pandemic is a thing of the past by May 2021 (I know it's not a given but let's assume it is for the purposes of this), I'm looking to do a big trip since I'm graduating college and don't start my job until August or September (my choice). 

I want to do an epic adventure, but I'm not sure where to begin. I really want to explore all of Europe (especially eastern europe) as well as southeast Asia. I want to live in hostels, party, eat good food, and meet cool people, but I'm also really interested in hiking at some unique places. For a trip this long, I can see myself getting lonely so making some friends is a must. I've never traveled solo, but I've been  to Australia and NZ with my friend, and to a bunch of places with family when I was younger.

If I have about 3 months to do this, what would you recommend? I just need a solid starting point for beginning my planning.

I have saved a lot throughout the years for something like this and my budget is &gt;$15,000 (although I want to get value for my money and I don't care for fancy hotels or restaurants).",solotravel,bsrbsrbrs

Off to Colombia on a solo trip next week - any last-minute tips?,"I'm flying to Cartagena, Colombia next Saturday. Will be spending 7(ish) weeks in Colombia. First time in South America so I'm very excited. I have a rough itinerary below...

* Cartagena (3 nights)
* Santa Marta (4 nights)
* Lost City trek (4 nights)
* Palomino (3 nights)
* Minca (4 nights)
* Bogota (3 nights)
* Salento (3 nights)
* Medellin (6 nights) (With some time spent in Guatape)
* Pereira (3 nights)
* Cali (4 nights)

After that, I either plan on staying in Colombia for the final two weeks of the trip or potentially heading to Dominican Republic. See what happens! I've not booked anything yet (bar 2 nights in Cartagena) so this is an extremely rough plan. I've also looked at going to San Andres y Providencia but the horrendous events of the past week there (Hurricane Iota) make that increasingly unlikely...

Backpack Essentials?,"Hi everyone,

My girlfriend is going to China for a year and a half for work, and she had asked for a few things (backpack, travel blanket, etc.).

I want to put this all together as a big Christmas gift. Are there any essentials that are small/lightweight?

I have the backpack, and then inside I have a compact travel blanket, extra iPhone charging cables, a water bottle, a waist strap for the bag, small carry-on-sized bottles, and some organizer bags for her suitcase.

I thought something like a travel quick-drying towel would be useful, and I also thought about water shoes for the beaches,  but I also don't want to fill up her bag with stuff she hasn't specifically asked for and/or won't use. I'm probably going to go with the towel because it's light and can really pack light.

She already has a good size portable charger and two power cubes.

Extended Solo Stay in Mexico,"I was recently told by my company that we won't be going back to the office until at least April 2021. As a result, I've realized that there's nothing stopping me from going somewhere tropical and working off my laptop for a month or two during the winter. While I've done solo travel before, I've never done so for more than about a week, so I'm not overly familiar with the differences in how to plan. Currently, I'm targeting Mexico (probably Playa del Carmen) for a January/February stay.

Europe by train,"Hii all,

&amp;#x200B;

I (20f) hope to travel through Europe for about 2 to 3 weeks by train (as I don't have a driver license) next year (if Covid allows it). I would normally travel from Amsterdam, but I'd also be willing to first travel somewhere else to start the actual roadtrip.

I want to travel Central America. Are El Salvador and Honduras safe?,"So I (f22) am planning to go to Central America in 2022 for 12-14 weeks. My route would be Belize - Guatemala - El Salvador - Honduras - Nicaragua - Costa Rica - Panama - (?caribbean island maybe?) 

My bf would join me in Costa Rica but before that I might be travelling alone. 
Looking at official websites El Salvador and Honduras seem to be dangerous and there are not that many travel reports especially on ES. It looks like it is mostly drug related issues though that normal tourists would not come in contact with? 

Does anybody have any experience with these countries? What do you think?

Edit: Wow, this got waaaaaay more attention than I thought! I expected to get maybe 2 comments so this is awesome!! 
Thank you so much for everyone who took time out of their day to reply to my post! Especially the people who wrote really detailed advice, suggestions and stories!

"Anyone here ever bought a ""flexible"" dates ticket for international travel?","I have to travel internationally between December and January. I may need to change my departure or return dates depending on the situation.
The tickets have dates on them. The flexibility is that I can amend the dates or cancel free of cost. I am trying to find out if there is some fine print somewhere that will screw me.

I have two options for my destination:

Etihad (flexible dates)

Qatar airways (flexible dates)

If something happens which one of these is less likely to screw me? 

I have travelled with Etihad before but it was a simple economy class ticket. Never used flexible plan. Tried to contact their customer support on twitter and I am getting vague answers from Etihad. Qatar airways is not responding.

Edit: looking at their websites, the qatar site seems a lot more flexible where your ticket will be valid for the next two years. Etihad is using confusing language.

Tried to contact their customer support with specific examples and they are giving me vague answers.

Edit2: 

Confusing wording on the sites. Qatar seems better but I don't like their timings and the airline

How responsible is it to travel to Southern CA right now?,"My brother wanted me to visit for Thanksgiving, so over the Summer he bought me a flights from NYC to southern CA. He bought me tickets that leave a week before Thanksgiving. Now as things approach I and things are locking down I am getting hesitant. Actually earlier today I decided not to go, but when I did that I realized how much I needed this trip. I cant drive, I live in the city and I LITERALLY have not traveled more than 20 blocks since March. I feel like I am emotionally about to break, and I get a sense that everything is locking down again, and I am genuinely concerned about my mental health over the Winter. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here is the plan I have: I plan to fly on a mostly empty night flight, and NOT stay with my brother, self quarantine at an airbnb for the 14 days (take a Covid test before I leave and a molecular CoVID  test 7 days after my flight for peek accuracy) After that second test is confirmed negative I would do a socially distanced Thanksgiving with him and his wife outside.  After the two weeks are up I would stay with him for another week and then drive up to Northern CA with him (as he needs to drive up to SF) where I then would fly out of SFO. 

&amp;#x200B;

Some people are like ""DONT LEAVE YOUR HOUSE!!"" and other people like ""don't worry about it I was on a flight last week, its fine!""

Month Long Workation Accommodations: Any feedback?,"As usual, all of this is relative to pandemic status next year. But.

I'm lucky enough to make good money working from home with a flexible enough schedule to do workations. I'm very attracted to the idea of month long jaunts (basically turns 3-5 weeks yearly of travel into several months), and I'm looking to crowd source a few opinions on this.

I know there are serviced apartments you can rent, especially in places like Bangkok (a target of mine) but I really don't think I'd have as much fun holed up in an apartment, whereas I can still meet people in a hostel. Do some of the long-term deals tend to carry over into private rooms in hostels, in anyone's experience? Alternative suggestions that meet in the middle?

This is less of a concern for other itineraries I'm thinking about (something like a week each in Barceona, Madrid, Valencia, and Morocco) because I know hopping around will be involved. On this note, does anyone have experience with 1-2 week hops between cities while doing it vs. choosing a ""home base"", and what were some things that might be worth considering between the two?",solotravel,jtrom1010
"With 14 days (excl travel), do you do Prague + another nearby country or stay in the CR?","Just doing some tentative research for next summer (COVID willing), and strongly considering making Prague the next place I hit for solo travel. I've done years of research and couldn't be more thrilled with the choice.

I'm not the type to hit as many countries as possible just to do it, but 5-7 days in a city (maybe less depending where) is usually enough for me. I have done a big time dive into what to do in the CR and I can't say anything excites me so far. If I'm already out there, I'm leaning towards making it a Prague +Vienna/Budapest/Munich/something like that combo rather than taking my time to explore the rest of the Czech Republic.

I love natural beauty and the small town charm, but I'm always more thrilled by a bit of culture shock, food, nightlife, and interesting architecture/history.

Am I missing out on some big time hidden gems in the Czech Republic? I'm less concerned about the logistics of country hopping than I am potentially robbing myself by writing off the rest of a sizeable nation while I'm there.

**Edit:** Wow guys, thanks so much for all the feedback! Few things:

I've settled on Prague, Budapest, and a 3 day stretch between Vienna and Bratislava in between. How I split that up is TBD, but with that, I can pick and choose how to spend that time and I can do it midweek so I get weekend days in Prague and Budapest both. 

Also, apparently my wording was ambiguous. Prague was never in play for 2 full weeks, my original question was mostly ""should I do this apparently popular country hop"" or really dig into all the CR has to offer? However, nonetheless, all my questions have been answered and I'm more excited now than when I posted. :) ",solotravel,jtrom1010

Solo trip to Canary Islands,"Hi guys! Just wanted to share with you my latest experience in the Canary Islands (Spain).

* **Trip Length**

The trip lasted 14 days broken down in this way: 4 days Tenerife, 4 days Gran Canaria, 5 days Fuerteventura and 1 day Lanzarote. I was hoping to visit the remaining 3 smaller islands but unfortunately I ran our of time. That's a good excuse to come back soon!

* **Covid-19 situation**

I  flew from the UK and there was no quarantine required upon arrival nor negative test certification (I went there in Mid-October so the situation might have changed in the meantime). However, you are required to download and fill an health control form and obtain your QR Code, to show it at the control points upon arrival in Spain. Also, a temperature check is performed at the airport.

All shops/restaurants/bars were open until late in the evening and masks are mandatory both inside and outside. Very few tourists everywhere and hotels/resorts/beaches mostly empty.

* **Logistics**

There are plenty of daily flights from London and I paid £30 only (one-way to Tenerife) with 2 luggages. The price carrying one luggage only was £12! I also flew from Gran Canaria to Fuerteventura, the flight takes approx. 30mins and I paid £20. From Tenerife to Gran Canaria I decided to catch a ferry, the problem is that I booked it only few days in advance and I ended up paying £70 for a 1,40h journey. Lesson learnt for the next time!

Once you arrive, the best way to go around is renting a car.   

You should rent a car at the airport. It’s better reserving the car on [www.rentalcars.com](http://www.rentalcars.com/) where you can find very good deals. Be aware that on top of the price you see on the website, you will need to pay the insurance, which is normally around 50/70£ for 4 days of renting. You could also choose not to pay for the insurance, but then you will have to pay upfront for a deposit of £1,100 (I chose this option in Tenerife and I got my deposit back after one week). Generally,, the roads in Tenerife and Gran Canaria are very good, especially in Tenerife where there is a main highway surrounding the Teide volcano and the traffic is not crazy at all. Fuerteventura is wilder, many roads are not paved so having an insurance is highly recommended. Renting a car is absolutely the best way to explore the island on your own and I would strongly recommend it. Also, fuel is super cheap at approx. 0,8EUR/liter so a full tank for a small car would not cost more than 50 EUR. 

* **Tenerife (Accommodation- What to see)**

I stayed in Playa de las Americas, in the South part of the island. In normal conditions, this would be the party place of the island, with loads of hotels, resorts, bars and restaurants. It’s a very clean and beautiful town, however due to covid, it was literally a ghost town (which I totally didn’t mind as I was somewhere else exploring every single day). Be aware that there are no beaches here (as in the whole island basically), but you could stay in a luxurious 5 star mega-pool resort for 60/70£ a night, like I did. To be honest this was not the best option for me as I've never used the pool or the other facilities of the resort and I could have stayed in a much cheaper place. Another lesson learnt for the next time.

 If you want to experience a more vibrant town, probably you should opt staying in Santa Cruz, the capital, especially if you land in Tenerife North Airport.

1. Teide Volcano and the surrounding National Park- what else?? Absolutely amazing. Plan to stay there a whole day. You can reach 2,500 mt with your own car, then if you want to proceed further, there is a cable car which takes you to 3,500mt. Bring a jacket/jumper with you as the temperature when I climbed was about 5/7 degrees. Tickets to the cable car can be bought online (it costs around 25 EUR). Normally there are long lines but due to the corona I was barely the only person there.

2. Santa Cruz de Tenerife- nice to wander around for few hours, especially if you fancy nice local restaurants. 

3. National Park of Anaga- in the North of the island. You can spend here easily the entire day hiking the spectacular mountains. It’s rather a green area so the landscape is totally different from the Teide National Park. Be aware that the roads are good but being on the slopes of high mountains….it might be a bit overwhelming driving through.

4. Punta de Teno- the most western part of the island, quite difficult to get there. To avoid crowds getting there, the road is closed every day from 10 to 19 and only buses go there in between. There is an amazing lighthouse at the very end of the road which you should reach at sunset to remain astonished by the view. I went there at sunset after 19 with my own car. Absolutely worth it.

5. Vineyards/wine tasting close to Pueblo de la Cruz- Actually didn’t go there but I heard it’s worth a visit- keep this as a back-up plan in case you end up having some spare time.

* **Gran Canaria (Accommodation- What to see)**

I opted for an hotel in Maspalomas, in the South of the island. Paid £50 a night with breakfast included. I could have spent lot less also here, but I wanted to be comfortable.

Gran Canaria in my opinion is the less interesting island I've visited. It's very commercial and apart from the Maspalomas dunes (which are stunning) and some hikes, the other parts of the island are not impressive at all. I spent there 4 days but I suggest cutting to 3 days max.

1. Maspalomas dunes. 

2. Las Palmas de Gran Canaria. The capital city. The city center is buzzling- full of cute bars/restaurants 

* **Fuerteventura (Accommodation- What to see)**

In my opinion, the best island in terms of landscapes.   

I stayed in the North, Corralejo. It’s a very cute town with lot of restaurants and bars. The North side of the island is well known for its surfing activities, so you will find a lot of surf houses and a “hippy vibe”.  Highly recommended. You could also opt to stay in the South in Costa Calma, which has amazing beaches but when I went there most of the places/resorts were closed and it lacked some vibe. Not recommended, at least nowadays.

1. Corralejo dunes- it’s a Natural park where you will find real desert dunes and a long beach to relax.

2. El Castillo beaches (especially Playa de los Lagos and Playa de la Concha where you can use your sun cream a lot…)- not far from Corralejo, go there for the best sunset of the whole island. There is a lighthouse and the scenery is very cool, especially because I brought a drone and I got very cool shots.

3. Caldern Horno- it’s a small volcano, you can climb it and get very cool photos

4. Cofete Beach- the most difficult beach to reach- you have to drive a long dirty road but…it was probably the best place I have seen in the whole trip. There is a small cemetery on the sand…if you get there at sunset it’s stunning. Be aware that you cannot swim there (the whole Western coast of Fuerte is not recommended to swim because of the strong sea and winds).

5. Sotavento beach - this is probably the best beach if you want to practice kitesurf/windsurf- it’s like 5km long, yellow fine sand and turquoise water. Amazing.

6. Playa de Esquinzo- the most famous for surfers- it’s on the West side so again not the best to swim, but the scenery is stunning especially at sunset.

7. All the windmills around the island, there are many and you can make cool shots of them.

8. Costa Calma- this is a resort place, so quite empty, but the best beaches are there- strongly recommended if your goals is just to lay under the sun

I spent only few hours in Lanzarote on a day trip from Fuerteventura catching a ferry (price 60£ with the car) so really cannot comment much. However, I managed to drive through the Timanfaya National Park and it looks like a Martian landscape, absolutely unreal.

I am in search of interesting countries for a trip next year.,"


Hello fellow travelers.
I want to on interesting trip next year. Since my plans for this year got screwed thanks to Covid. I want it to be something that i remember a long time and i don’t have regret in the aftermath. You will find more informations below.

I am from Germany.  I already did a bicycle tour from Switzerland to Berlin. Most of my other trips were basically sightseeing holidays. My only adventure trip until now was in norway for two weeks.

I already visited following countries:

-Austria
-Switzerland 
-France
-Italy (5-times)
-Spain (2-times)
-England
-Norway
-Belgium
-Netherlands

Countries which would interest me:

-Ireland
-Singapore
-South Korea
-Sri Lanka
-Australia 
-New Zealand

Length: Between 3 -6 weeks (June to august)

Budget: Enough to afford six weeks sightseeing, accommodation, flights and so on

Interests:

-Culture and food 
-Great and memorable views 
-Meeting interesting people 

Kind of trip I want:
I honestly enjoy both adventure trips and sightseeing trips. 


I am open to suggestions regarding other countries as well. My preference lies outside of Europe. As mentioned above i want it to be a trip which memories I can share with friends and family. Leaving my own comfort zone and journey through other countries before i start my own family is one of my biggest aims. I don’t want to regret my decision in a few years from now.

Thanks for all your suggestions in advance. Stay safe.",solotravel,Black-Maria-one-piec
"Adjusting to ""Normal Life""","Hey y'all, I'm hoping to hear back from some long term travelers, who no longer travel so much. 

I'm sure most solo travelers, especially long term travelers, understand me when I talk about how easy it is to make connections with people while on the road. You go to a hostel, there's a person sitting at a table, you can basically walk up to them, strike a conversation about deep personal things, and within 30 minutes, you and this person feel like you've known each other your whole lives, and are now planning to hitchhike together to the nearest rainbow gathering sleeping under trees in the same tent because there is a sense of trust. 

Countless times this happens in different variations, it is CRAZY how many people I found myself thinking ""holy shit, we could actually be best friends wtf"" because of how personal the conversations were, how loving and accepting and trusting people are while on the road. Same with couchsurfing, and hitchhiking, and volunteering, etc etc etc. 

Now to present day. I'm starting a seasonal job in the US, it's my first official, legal job where I will have roots for the next 6 months. And I am trying to make friends here. 

But damn. It has not been easy for me. I'm so used to this instant vulnerability with people, and I'm so used to just opening up basically immediately to people because of how common place it always has been while moving around, but I don't think that non-traveling people respond very well to this sort of instant interaction. I think I might actually frighten them away? 

My feeling is that it's seen as suspicious. So, I guess what I'm asking is, how the hell do I make friends with people in a stable or regular sort of life? The travel way isn't working, so I'm not entirely sure.

"How to travel with others when solo travel is much preferred, finding balance","How does one plan a hybrid trip with others when the plans change completely, and go in a different direction than even alternative preferences due to schedule or budget limitations that are not shared?

I have been speaking with some friends about a trip for some time now but the plan has changed from the original idea due to a combination of Covid fears, budget and schedule. I feel bad bailing as we've been talking about this for a while, but our first choice and my alternative preference have both been decided against for a third place which I don't really care for ATM as the main draw is not in active season and there is not much culinary excitement which is my primary interest. 

The others want to travel just to go ""anywhere but here"" but I am a little more deliberate with my travel. That being said, I find myself at times wanting to be flexible and go on group trips just to go on a group trip but I am finding it difficult to commit, also because of fear of being the odd guy out and go against the flow since I prefer solo travel or travel with specific friends that I know we can align well.

There is still opportunity for me to go solo to my alternative beforehand and meet up with the group at their choice not too far away but the itinerary they are planning is fitting a lot into a short period of time. If I were to arrive after to shorten my participation, it could be difficult to join up with the others physically, and/or align energy-wise.

I am having a hard time finding the flexibility within me to join. But I feel bad bailing despite having fair reasons. 

Fellow solo travelers, how do you make hybrid trips like this work? Should I be more flexible, visit my alternate choice and meet up after and go along for the ride or do I call that it has gone too far in a different direction and just politely decline? If I were to go all that way to my alternate and not join with the others at their nearby choice, it probably would not be well perceived. So it seems to be coming down to an all-or-nothing.

I have only traveled international twice. Both times to Japan. I went solo to japan last year. I want to go again but have mixed feelings about my experience going alone,"I have been to japan twice. 

- Once with a group of 5 friends for two weeks, We went all around japan (Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Fuji, Kyoto)
- Once solo for two weeks (I just stayed in Tokyo and didnt do any day trips for two weeks)

The first time I went was interesting. I enjoyed being with my friends but most nights we all wanted to do different things, all had different budgets and regardless of what we did one person wasn't satisfied with what we did. Overall I did enjoy it though as it was much better with friends

The 2nd time I went, Was solo. I liked this a lot more as I got to see and do whatever I wanted without having to worry what my friends did, This was okay for the first week however towards the end of my trip I did feel rather lonely as I hadn't really made any friends and the majority of things I did was all solo.

Im fairly introverted. I tried using meetup/air bnb events to make things interesting but ultimately I got bored very quickly. It also probably didnt help that I chose to stay in Tokyo for the whole two weeks and I ended up just going to arcades everyday for the last 3 or 4 days of my trip. This trip was incredibly low budget, I stayed in hostels and ate cheap food as I thought it would be more wise to spend money on activities and experiences rather than food.

Anyhow. I want to go back again next year for the 3rd time. It most likely will be solo again as my close friend circle are relatively poor with money and spending and they wont be willing to spend a few thousand dollars traveling.

What were some of the things you do when solo traveling to enjoy yourself more?

Thinking about going to Costa Rica in January,"I (28f) traveled around europe and asia before as a solo traveler! I was waiting until a graduate from my master which I will do in december 2020 to travel for a long period again. I’m from Canada and I don’t feel like going overseas because of Covid (got stuck in France when the pandemic started back in march). I am trying to find an alternative and I’m thinking about Costa Rica since I enjoy surfing and scuba diving.
As any of you been there since Covid started? Or does anyone have any suggestions? I’m planning to go for a month ish and I don’t mind having to quarantine once I’m back home but I would like not to have to quarantine in the country I visit! I’m open to go pretty anywhere in Central/south America to be honest!",solotravel,GabbyCana
How do you manage work vs. travel?,"I’m a 22 year old dude and have been working full-time for about the last 2+ years. I’ve been overseas twice, but both times with my family and siblings when I was younger - New Zealand when I was like 14 and the US when I was 17. 

Now that I’m working full time, I guess I’m wondering how most of you manage work and travelling? I really don’t want to live with regrets, I already am worried about wasting my youth and getting stuck, and I’m really interested in travelling so I really want to solo travel/travel with friends while I’m young. (Not that you can’t do it when you’re older, but I guess it would be a little different)

Do most of you just travel in your annual leave/vacation time? Do you get a new job and travel when you’re between jobs? Do you take unpaid leave? Do you quit without something else lined up and just worry about it when you get back?

I’m fortunate that I still live at home currently, with very low expenses so it would be easier for me to just quit, but I’m still wondering about what all of you amazing people do. I may move out over the next year or two. And want to travel once we get through this whole pandemic thing 

I don’t know what it’s called, but I’ve heard of people who try to work a couple of years and save, then travel for a bit and repeat, which sounds cool.

Anyway - let me know what you do, any advice, and if there’s any good resources I should check out. It would really help me out :) thank you!",solotravel,BiriusSlack_

Solo Travel in Japan and Korea?,"Hello fellow travelers. I’m a 34/F whose done a fair bit of travel. I don’t have any true set plans but I’m thinking about going to Asia when things open up again.

"So now that many of us can't make concrete plans for solo travel, what are you spending your time on?","I noticed with the travel restrictions how much of my future planning is thinking about where to travel next.

Need a home base for 3-4 months in southern hemisphere for winter to escape SAD. Thinking Brazil/Chile/???,"Looking to move from NY to somewhere in South Hemisphere from January 1 -&gt; April 2020. I'll be working remotely, and can probably move every 30-45 days. I see a lot of AirBnBs in major cities going for about $300-$600 a month for something nice. Not sure if that's b/c of COVID or if that's regular prices in the Winter but it beats paying $1200 a month in the winter here. 

Anyways, my top priorities are (in no specific order): 1) need decent internet 2) would like warm beaches 3) safe 4) decent dating prospects. 

I'm thinking Santiago, Chile; Rio, Brazil, and Sao Paulo, Brazil are worth visiting for a month each, but I'm open to other places as well like Colombia but Bogota, Medellin, &amp; Cartagena are in the Northern Hemisphere so maybe I can do Colombia in April?",solotravel,AndreNowzick
Anyone else hates a guitarist at the hostel?,"I'm probably in the minority here, but I can't stand people who play guitar in the hostel - especially those who bring their own. People don't play their music playlist on a Bluetooth speaker out in the common area, because that'd be rude and inconsiderate, but why is acceptable for people to play the guitar? Sometimes they can also sing, so they do, or someone who sings would join in. The solo travellers who bring their own guitar is so baffling to me, it's such a cumbersome instrument to carry across the world, backpacking - and if they're travelling by themselves, staying at hostels, did they bring it for my benefit? I certainly didn't request it. Or is it to get a bit of an ego boost?",solotravel,joereadsstuff

Thinking about solo traveling,"So I’m new to the whole solo travel thing. I’m 18 years old, and working a part time job at a place I hate. I hate my boss, and he hired 2 family members and gave them full time switching us to part time. So now I only make around $300 - $450 a paycheck. 

Unfortunately there’s no way I can work remotely working at a Grocery Outlet (If I’m not allowed to put the name I will edit and fix this) unless  someone else knows something I don’t about remote work for them, I’ve looked around but haven’t found anything.

I’ve looked into online jobs, I’ve applied for Rev.com but didn’t get accepted. 

My “plan” was to buy a laptop, get an online job, buy a van or something, build a nice interior to sleep, cool, etc. and get solar panels for charging. But, there’s multiple ways I can go about this, just don’t know the best one.

1. Go to college.
If needed, I could go to college for some kind of e-commerce, or computer science. (I know Python, and I absolutely love computers. I’ve been in love with programming, building them, etc for years.)

2. Get a contract for an at sea processor.
I could go out to sea and process seafood and make $16 - $27/hr with 16 hour days, 7 days a week, and for 65 - 90+ days. I could go out to sea, come back with like $19k and then leave to travel. 

3. Become a Digital Nomad.
I could use a combo of a college degree and score a nice online job, buy a laptop (I have a pc at my parents home to work on atm) and then fly to Chiang Mai, or somewhere, I don’t know.

Weirdest people you've met while travelling?,"I'll start. Sorry in advanced for the long post. It's a doozy, but I'll try to keep it as concise as possible.

tl;dr: I (25M) met and spent an evening with a drunk, creepy middle aged dude from Dubai who borderline tried to be my sugar daddy and set me up with his 13 year old daughter back at home, and got upset when I got the fuck outta there.

I was in Phnom Penh by myself at a night market and I met a middle aged man from Dubai at an ice cream stall, also alone. He seemed friendly, his english was okay, so we talked for a bit and I kindly said goodbye.

I bumped into him again on the street. He insisted he buy me a beer. Sure why not, and I buy him a round to return the favour. He continues trying to buy me beer throughout the night, but I know my limit and won't get pressured to go past it. I get up to a buzz (3 or 4 beers in) and say no more, which he gets slightly upset about.

Throughout the night he would point to young local women around us and give me a creepy smile and laugh. He talked about how the prostitute he hired in Thailand stole his money, and how he has to pay for sex but it's free for me because I'm young. He says if I ever came to Dubai he'd pay for everything and he has more than $150k USD in his bank account. He insisted we go to a bar and I be a wingman for him. I say NOPE to all of this and he said something like ""come oooon, what's wrong with you? You're young!"" which he said every time I said no to anything.

Things got really weird when he started talking about his ""very beautiful"" 13 year old daughter and how he would show me more pics of her if I have time to stop by his hotel room. Now, I've never been to Dubai and am unfamiliar with the culture, but maybe this is part of it (please correct me if I'm wrong), but that's fucked up in most parts of the world. 

I'm not stupid and wasn't going to spend any more time with him past my own amusement, so throughout the evening I had stated many times that I will leave at 10pm. At this point it was 9:30 and I wanted to bounce. He insisted we get food before I leave. Fine, last thing with this guy.

Finally after we eat, I say ""alright, I gotta go now!"" He starts acting appalled and gets extremely upset (like I hadn't been saying I needed to leave at 10 all throughout the night), saying things like ""you don't want to hang out with me, fine. I buy you food, I do this and that and you still want to leave early!"" I say ""I never asked you to buy me anything, you've insisted! I've told you numerous times that I will leave at 10, and I will."" He starts guilting me, saying ""fine, go then. No don't worry about this meal, I said I'd pay for it and I will, and you still want to go. Fine."" I say ""nope I'll pay for my own meal. Nice meeting you, see you later!"" and I got the fuck outta there.

Maybe it was just a typical encounter with a lonely, drunk, creepy middle aged man from Dubai, but boy was an encounter with this type of person weird to me.

SO, who have been the weirdest people you've met/hung out with while solo?",solotravel,CrustyLipschitz

Update on the solo soul searching trip,"Thank you for all who left good ideas and nice comments. A few places have crossed my mind and I wanted to ask for advice on anyone whose been to these places. Lots have mentioned New Zealand and Bali. Someone just mentioned Egypt on the feed which is my life goal and most said it wasn’t entirely unsafe. Anyways, here are my ideas: 

Israel- seems very spiritual and I’ve actually heard it’s really safe and peaceful. It would be amazingly intimate to visit places the Bible has mentioned. 

Greece- I’ve wanted to do this one for a long time but only two or three mentioned this. 

Taiwan- why not? 

Alaska- I wouldn’t mind living in the freezing cold for a little- as long as I’m alone and free thinking. 

Hawaii- still on my list and it is in the U.S. which might be more feasible if I do travel in February.

Maldives- sounds relaxing 

Ireland- I got a lot of people saying this one and I sure wouldn’t mind.

Travel in your teens /twenties vs. travel in your forties/fifties ?,"I've spent my twenties and my thirties (I'm about to turn 38) focused on raising children and building my career.

Realistically, it's going to be in my late forties and early fifties when I'm going to get to do things like sections of the Pacific Crest Trail, and other things of that magnitude (I'm referring to several months away at a time, rather than just a week or so here and there).

First Solo Trip - How to Cope with Massive Change in Perspective?,"Before I decided to take this trip, I was very comfortable in life. I had a great job, a good gf, and a routine in life where I branched out of my comfort zone once in a while. However, after talking with a couple of close friends and taking LSD, I decided I didn't want a life of constant comfort/familiarity. I aggressively interviewed for a better job, broke up with my gf, and booked a solo trip to Mexico - I jumped in the deep end.

I just got back from my trip and it was possibly the best experience in my life. Where I'm from in the US, the culture is heavily based around money/status/material objects. However, when I was in Mexico, I didn't see many luxury cars and mansions, but rather met amazing individuals with strong personalities/character. There were quite a few people who pursued creative careers where they got to express themselves, people who I had just met being extremely welcoming, offering me drinks, suggestions on where to go, and access to anything I wanted. If we partied too hard one night, they offered to look after me, made sure I was having a good time and ultimately being safe. Even though the trip was only 2 weeks, by the end of it I felt closer to them than some of my best friends. 

I'm feeling very confused and sad now, because it feels like my worldview and values changed. I felt like I was my authentic self when I was alone in Mexico - so much more extroverted, meeting new people everyday, going on dates, and loving life. I felt like I truly had a passion for life and not just chasing the same things people around me are/going through motions. Now that I'm back home in the same place, with the same people, doing the same things, my mindset is reverting back to the old me. It feels like a lot of what I previously valued went out the window and I have more appreciation for exploring new places, meeting likeminded and kindhearted people, and living life to the fullest.

Is this a phase that will eventually pass? While I don't want to be sad anymore, I definitely don't want to crawl back into a life of extreme comfort.",solotravel,1stTimeTravels

How did you get started in your travels?,"As the title asks, how did you guys go about planning and starting your first trip solo?

I’ve been longing to hit the road on my own for a long time but haven’t done it yet. Unfortunately due to covid now doesn’t seem like a good time to get out there but I think it’s a good time to plan! 

I’m (26M) in Canada, southern Ontario to be more precise. I’ve got next to no experience travelling so I’m really unsure where to even begin. 

Any tips for making that first trip a reality would be greatly appreciated!!!",solotravel,supposed_adult

Where have you gone that had the best mix of city/ nature?,Im a female in my early twenties. When I travel I LOVE getting a combo of nature and exploring cities.

New name while traveling,"Does anybody else go by (a) different name(s) while they’re traveling? 

I never really liked my full first name or the default shortened version of it. I’m from the northeast US and the first vowel is an “a” followed by a double consonant so its already overly nasal, but also since English has like 8 different ways “a” can be pronounced, accents have a HUGE effect on the way it comes out. Half the time i feel like I’M saying it wrong! 

I recently left to solo travel around the US doing workaways and seasonal jobs and have been going by a different nickname; one that’s still contained in the original, just an isolation of the middle syllable. It’s short, sweet, and easy to pronounce and remember. It’s taken a minute to adjust To it but honestly it fits well! I feel like a new person, like I’m really getting a fresh start.

No one back home knows I’m doing this and I feel like they would laugh. Maybe because it seems arbitrary, maybe because the new name is cooler and they think I’m trying too hard, maybe because it sounds like it’s short for something else entirely. I don’t care, I like it.

If I finish in my first city and decide I don’t like how it feels, I still have two or three other nicknames I can extract from my birth name (thanks dad!). When I move onto my next place I can always switch it up again and try something new! Maybe I’ll adopt a slightly different persona based on the nickname and region, who knows! The possibilities are endless! 

If you guys have ever done something like this, let me know how it turned out for you. Is it confusing to keep it all straight? Does it always feel like lying? Do you find that your personality shifts with the name? I feel like at the very least, this could be a cool social experiment.",solotravel,cjwellz13
"Met someone special, things could be great, 2020 thought otherwise, a lesson is learned","So, a little less than a year ago, I’ve traveled solo to Buenos Aires where I stayed for a month. Everything was great and became even better during my last week there, when I’ve met this cute and quite unconventional girl. She was also a foreigner, a (much more experienced) solo traveler, and she was staying there for a couple of months or so. From the moment I laid my eyes on her I knew she was special. Our first encounter confirmed that. I like to believe that she saw something in me as well. We’ve spent some relaxing time together (sightseeing, sitting in parks and just talk, taking lunch, etc.), but nothing more. 

Knowing that there was only a few days left for me there, and given the fact that I was in a near to end longtime relationship (which I also told her about), any thought of taking things further seemed pointless and inappropriate. Also, I wasn't so sure about my actual feelings for her, since I didn't knew her that well yet. Saying goodbye was tough, but I remained positive knowing that being in touch, it would give us the opportunity to know each other better and maybe meet again somehow down the road... I thought.

Long story short, came back home, ended my longtime relationship (not the easiest period for me), while messaging with her at an almost daily basis. At the beginning she was very responsive, playful and always so thoughtful, which made me think about her a lot during the days. It was obvious though that she was expecting something more from my part. I let her down. I didn’t respond as I should. Instead I was trying to be rational and keep things friendly and casual. I also needed to clear my head from my recent, difficult, brake up. There will be a better moment for this… I was thinking.

That’s when I started noticing her initial warm reactions to gradually cool down. This shook me up a little, and made me realize how much I liked her. Right before I enter the friend zone (or maybe a little bit after), I decided that, even if it’s late and despite knowing that I was risking our still fragile friendship, I had to be more direct with her. 

And then… covid-19 happened, quarantine imposed, her flight back home canceled and everything else became secondary. I naturally shifted my focus on her safety and tried to be helpful, supportive and a little advisory. When she is back home, safe and relaxed, then we can discuss about anything. The last thing she needs right now, is me writing about pink purple skies and smooth fiery lips… I thought.

Meanwhile, she had previously met and made friends with a local guy, and since she was trying to find a better (to her current miserable) place to stay and reduce costs as well, she apparently accepted his offer to go and stay with him, until her departure. To be fair though, I don't really know if that's the way it happened. Only my assumption.

But again, a couple of days before she was about to fly back home, Argentina (only country in the world) banned all inbound and outbound flights for the next 4-5 months! She now was a foreign girl in a foreign country, jobless, and with no other option than to stay there and try to weather this pandemic storm and the upcoming threatening winter. That’s when you realize that, not being able to help someone you care about so much, it’s probably the worst feeling ever! I should also mention that I offered some financial help, but her being such a proud (and stubborn) person, didn’t want to hear any of that.

Soon, the frequency of her messaging started to drop and after a relatively long period of silence, she came back with a lengthy message stating, among other, that she is ok and that “there’s been some… developments”, and her up to then roommate is now her boyfriend.

To be honest, I thought I was prepared for this eventuality (for which I blame none but myself), but it struck me much harder than I could possibly imagine. I’ve sent back a relatively ~~charged~~ emotional message along with a poem I had written before, where I made clear my feelings for her. I also stated that I understand, and although it might take some time, I will eventually write back since my caring and interest for her was real and above anything else.

It took more than a month, when I finally sent a long and relatively friendly letter, hoping to at least re-establish some basic communication. A few days later, instead of an answer I discovered that I got blocked (for the first time in my life, yeah!). Such a weird feeling. A big “why”, zero answers, and a few uncertain and contradictory assumptions, is all you left with. For the rest of your existence!

But it’s been more than two months now, and during this period the situation in Argentina went downhill in multiple ways, so it’s difficult for me to stop thinking and worrying about her. They say that time cures everything, and that the best antidote is to just meet new people. I did that, moved on, but to be honest, I still have this bad taste in mouth from how things ended up. More importantly though, I simply miss my once friend and I can only hope that she’s ok.

Anyway, this is a lesson learned and at the same time my advice to anyone (especially travelers): if you unexpectedly meet someone truly special for you, make her/him your overall priority, change schedules, forget about others, and let her/him know exactly how you feel. Don’t wait for the “proper” moment. And as we all know very well by now, tomorrow should never be taken for granted. Neither the feelings of another person.

Safe travels to all

EDIT: 

Ok I admit that my reaction was probably a mistake and I can see this more clearly now. But again, it's better to show your annoyance verbally (or written) than not say anything at all. Especially when there's the distance factor which leads to many misinterpretations, no matter how cool and smart the other person is.",solotravel,leo_4m
"I feel that I'm getting too comfortable with the 9-5 life, and that it's going to be difficult to long term travel again.","So bit of backstory, I made [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/g85w4p/ive_come_to_a_decision_on_what_to_do_once_this/) about 6 months ago. From that point, I've found a very well paying job, as well as an incredibly affordable living situation. With the current state of affairs of the world, I am still shooting to leave in late 2021 for a 12-18 month trip around the world.

What makes me nervous is I'm getting too comfortable with my 9-5 job life, I am making quite a bit more than I thought I would be, so I'm saving 3x more for my trip then I need. I like my job, and really like my relaxing life right now. With the rate I'm saving, I could literally pay off all of my student loans within 12 months.  Given quarantine, I am spending quite a bit more time and money on my home space, and frankly on the year leading up to my initial trip, I was minimalizing my possessions so it would be easier to leave everything behind. I feel comfortable hanging out at home all day now, I love to travel but right now my home office feels relaxing.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to go on this grand adventure around the world, I want to do something that most people in American society will never have the opportunity to do. I want to see how much a 12+ month trip will change me as a person, but I'm getting nervous that when the time comes to send in my resignation, I won't be able to do it. I had so much energy and excitement to leave in May 2020, but since that didn't happen and I don't know how long it's going to be until I can leave now, I don't know how to target my energy?

Anyone else feeling these vibes?

Edit: As many people are questioning the topic of finances. This is my issue, I literally set up my entire life up until the point where I want to leave to save money.  I could have afforded a really nice apartment, instead I'm living with 3 room mates, I could afford to treat myself and eat out more, instead I meal prep and shop with coupons, etc. I planned to sell my truck, my motorcycle, about $5000 worth of mechanic tools, etc.So money is the last worry in my mind, It's all about personal feelings at this point.

Financial Plan at the moment, which will be fully funded by August of 2021:

\- 6 months of living expenses in case of unemployment.

\- 12 months of everyday travel costs - this factors in not working on the road, day to day expenses. When volunteering/working along the way, I can bump this to 14-18 months.

\- 18 months of student loan payments for the entire time I'm gone.

\- a few thousand in my 401k and roth IRA up until the point where I leave, as I want to contribute to that as much as I can in my youth.

\- Around 10,000 dollars left over for savings once I get home, as I don't want to be completely broke savings wise. Rolling back into the USA being like ""I only have $4"" while boarding my plane home is not the way I want to end things.

So Don't worry, I'm being financially responsible :)

EDIT 2: Once again, Finances are not the problem, Student loans are not the problem, paying off student loans are not a problem or even a concerning thought. With this plan I will have all of my student loans payed off in 4 years or less. Please stop saying I'm dumb for not paying off student loans immediately and pushing my already delayed trip that was the only thing keeping me sane throughout my graduate program back another 12 months. If I was smart I would drop the $20,000 I have saved for this trip into the stock market instead of blowing it traveling around the world for an entire year. This isn't about the money.  


  
EDIT 3: Decided the best way to get out of this slump is to travel more, Currently looking at flights for late November for safer locations, Possibly camping somewhere or a more distanced holiday. ",solotravel,mordor958

1 Week in Peru: May 2021,"Hey friends! 

First and foremost, in case you didn't see it, Budget Air is pushing an AeroMexico deal that got me roundtrip from SLC&gt;LIM for **$267.** No idea about other departure hubs, but I'd imagine it's not JUST for SLC, so yeah. Don't say you weren't told. 

Anywho, I've got essentially a full week in Peru (something like 9 days to pad travel and have an actual, full week) for May of 2021. 

I have done some decent research and basically came to the idea that I should do a 60/40 or 70/30 ish time split between Cusco and Lima, with Cusco getting more time. 

Of COURSE, I want to see Machu Picchu, and I do love the outdoors in my own right (I currently live in Salt Lake) but that will probably be a 1-2 day thing for me, rather than the full 4-5 day Inca Trail. 

I am a big fan of hostel life, nightlife (although I like local dives more than clubs), and just generally interesting places to wander. Do you think my split is appropriate? I've heard Lima can be underwhelming, and was considering not bothering for more than a full day or so and just heading right over to Cusco and surrounding. Basically, making it a trip to Cusco with a layover in Lima.  

Any hostel recommendations, general thoughts on the itinerary, etc.?

**Tl;dr possible itinerary:**

Travel days excluded\*  
Day 1: Lima exploration and lots of food, night out

Day 2: Basically the same

Day 3: Leave for Cusco and explore area around my hostel

Day 4: Machu Picchu 

Day 5: Maybe MP again or more Cusco hangs

Day 6: One of the day trips around Cusco 

Day 7: Back to Lima, hang out until flight the next day.

Doing it again later on...,"Hey,

When I was 25 I went travelling with my girlfriend of the time to Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, India, Sri Lanka and Nepal for a yearlong trip. I cycled through most of SE Asia and hitchiked through Malaysia. 

6 years on and I got married and had a baby as I always planned to do. That trip has changed me forever though and I still think of something from it every day. Never has there been another year in my life which I can remember so well.

Anyway I plan to retire at 55 and I have told my wife from the start that I plan to go away to do some proper travelling again. We often take city breaks in Europe together and we visit her home country of Japan once a year or so. 

Her idea of a great holiday is the perfect hotel room and complete comfort. I want to see more chaos and dirt.

I am considering cycling through South America or maybe getting a motorbike and doing more or perhsps just travelling to all those far flung places with a backpack.

I guess my question is do you think this is a morally OK thing to do? My daughter will be in her twenties and my wife is very independent, I was also thinking she could meet me for breaks in some countries.

My other question is, what is it like travelling at that age? I am very into keeping fit and if luck is on my side hopefully I will still have my health at that age. What is it really like being the old guy at the hostel?

"Nagging Thought - Making it work with moving out, working etc...","Currently planning a year long trip (hopefully) as soon as everything gets back to normal. I'm 25, currently earning £18,000 a year, and living at home with my family. Doing a lot of travelling is a big goal of mine but I also don't want to stay at home any longer; I want to be independent.

However, I'm grappling with the idea of having to choose - I feel like moving out is a commitment (even though I've been to uni before) that will impede my ability to travel to the extent that I want to. I want this long trip then to have the ability to travel frequently as well but I've got nagging thoughts about it like   
\- What about paying rent I'm away, urely I won't be able to afford both?  
\- I could just move back with family briefly around travelling but if I move out i can't keep just going back and forth,  
\- If I just fuck it, move out and go travelling for a while, then come back, will I just be able to move back with friends again or will I need to move back with family?  
\- What about all my stuff?  


I know these arent HUGE problems; I'm gonna go travelling and that's that, and to an extent I feel a bit stupid as these just seem like, first world problems, but it is a weird time this age I feel. i feel like I'm being pulled in different directions while also running out of time and freedom before 'real life' kicks in.

Which was the laxest and strictest border crossing?,"**Laxest border crossing** (discounting the places without formal border control eg Schengen): 

For me it's the La Linea crossing into Spain. Inside the border post there were a set of automated gates, and a manual counter. I instinctively went to the automated gates, thinking that like a normal border post these would be faster, only to find they are not turned on. Only then did I notice everyone was going to the manual counter. I went up and tried to hand over my passport. The official glanced at the cover, didn't even take it, and waved me through. :o

**Strictest border crossing:**

Macau by far. I got a pat-down search by officials before I boarded the ferry, this was even stricter than flying, so I had a feeling things wouldn't be easy.

And I was right, as soon as I stepped off the ferry, I got taken into a holding room. Three or four officials started questioning me: what are you doing here, where did you go before, how much cash I had on me (and can they photograph the cash?), what are the names and occupation of my parents, where will I be staying etc etc. They asked to see my travel photos and my social media apps.

After a round of questioning they took me into a second holding room, with a dozen other people awaiting processing.  Some of these people were deported while I waited so I was nervous I would be too. After a very nerve wracking hour they finally took me to the immigration counter to have my passport processed.

There’s so much hype on San Miguel De Allende but the videos and seen the only thing that people seem to talk about is about the Parroquia that’s prominent building there.

Mexico - Dia de Muertos 2021,"Usually this time of year I try to flee my cold and dark home here in Europe to somewhere sunny and warm. Since this years plans got canceled by the pandemic I thought I'd get a head start on next year - in the hope that we've got everything under control by then.

Mexico has been on top of my to-go list for some time now, so I started to plan the following trip for the end of October/beginning of November:

* Mexico City: 5 Days, including a day trip to Teotihuacán
* Puebla: 2 Days
* Oaxaca: 4 Days, during the festivities

 

I'm planning on traveling domestically by bus, are there any other stops along my route you would suggest? Are two days in Puebla too little time? Also, if you have recommendations on where to stay in those places I'd be glad to hear them!

As for Dia de Muertos in Oaxaca, I found a trip on G-Adventures which covers that part of my trip and would also add a few days in Puerto Escondido. Since it's very reasonably priced and I've also read some positive reviews on G-Adventures on here I'm thinking about booking that. If anyone here traveled with them in Mexico I'd be happy about some reviews.

Finally a somewhat cultural question. Where I'm from All Saints Day is a rather private holiday. You visit the graves of family and friends, which have been decorated the days before, but it would be rather strange to have tourists there. From what I've read online that's quite different for Dia de Muertos - as long as you behave and dress accordingly it's fine to visit the graveyards. Any locals or people that have been in Mexico for Dia de Muertos here that wanna chime in? I just want to make sure I don't offend anyone while I'm there.

"8,000 miles in 2 weeks","In April of next year, I have to drive to Tucson for some work/business purposes. So assuming a baseline, I will have to drive to Arizona and back at the bare minimum for this trip. I have wanted to do a long solo road trip across the US landscapes for some time. I have enough vacation days to take approximately 10-11 days off on top of 3-4 days for my work in Tucson. So assuming that, I will have about 2 weeks to do this trip give or take a few days. My estimates say that just the driving part of this trip will take 120-150 hrs. So I will budget a week for just driving. That leaves me with the other week for my work in Tucson and any stops I make, so it will probably be a split of 3-4 days in Tucson and 3-4 days of sightseeing in various cities/parks across the US for a combined total of 7 days of non-driving. This trip from end to end will be roughly 8,000 miles. I will be driving to Arizona no matter what due to work, but I would like to see more of the western US by road as it is meant to be seen. The longest drive I have done before is Tampa-El Paso-Tampa so this will be quite a bit longer than that. I am fully aware that this trip will be very tolling on the body, but it should also be the adventure of a lifetime. This will be a solo trip by car with just me and my Toyota. Any advice on travel tips or what to see along the way is greatly appreciated. I would imagine that the mountainous areas of Lake Tahoe, Colorado and maybe Utah would have some snow during mid-April when I will be taking this trip, and I plan to take this route having accounted for snow along this route. I only plan to explore Dallas, Grand Canyon, San Francisco, Lake Tahoe, Seattle, Denver, and Detroit. Any other stops will be for rest/sleep. With that in mind, here is the planned route:

Tampa-Dallas

Dallas-Tucson

Tucson-Phoenix

Phoenix-Grand Canyon

Grand Canyon-Los Angeles

Los Angeles-San Francisco

San Francisco-Sacramento

Sacramento-Lake Tahoe

Lake Tahoe-Portland

Portland-Seattle

Seattle-Salt Lake City

Salt Lake City-Denver

Denver-Kansas City

Kansas City-St Louis

St Louis-Indianpolis

Indianpolis-Detroit

Detroit-Cincinnati

Cincinnati-Atlanta

Atlanta-Tampa

Did anyone struggle with asthma abroad? (central/south america etc),"I traveled to Mexico City a couple of years ago, and upon stepping out of the airport I felt as though it was a struggle to breathe. I only have mild asthma and it's never caused me a big problem to be honest. But as soon as I stepped into Mexico City I started to panic, because this sensation of not being able to breathe just wouldn't leave. I remember going to bed and almost gasping for breath. Either way, in the 2 weeks I was there, I got used to it eventually but I was never fully comfortable. I can only assume this is because MXC is high above sea level?

Been planning to go through CA/SA at some point next year by myself but I notice that many other SA/CA cities are high above sea level. Across Chile, Guatemala, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, and Bolivia, are cities with higher sea levels than MXC.

Even without COVID right now, it makes me wonder how I will cope in these places? Has anyone else with asthma, or like in my case, mild asthma, traveled to these regions? Was it a struggle breathing etc?",solotravel,Fruitcake36

Public transport through UK,"I'm planning a trip to UK, hopefully not so far in the future yet not during these hard days of pandemic. My main target for this trip is to see several places linked with technology and transport which are not so close to each other. For early plans I decided to visit places in West Midlands, Shropshire, Cheshire etc. My biggest issue is how to travel across these counties or through them by the means of public transport. The routes for example like Liverpool-Chester-Birmingham or some small routes like Birmingham-Bridgnorth. Travelling by rail seem to be quite a good pn shorter routes (Return on the same day ticket what a great idea!) But they start be quite expensive on longer routes at least for my home country standards. If You have any tips for travelling by rail I would really appreciate them. As for other ways like Buses I have no idea at all but heard they are cheaper and of course can get You where there's no railway. There are of course car rent companies which I consider as well (of course that's not public transport) but Haven't found any which will allow me to use their cars (I'm 21 with driving license for 3 years). Of course for in case of places worth visit in earlier mentioned area I will be happy to hear Your Suggestions both linked with my mentioned interests and not.

Visiting India,"I saw some negative experiences from people visiting India. As an Indian now living in the US, here are my two cents that I believe will make a trip to India much much better.

1. I do not recommend visiting the big metropolitan cities (Delhi, Mumbai) unless you are a foodie. They are unsafe and chaotic and hard to navigate. If you have an Indian friend then spend a couple days in ONE city with them and eat lots of food. If you like clubbing then hit up some clubs, because the Indian clubbing experience is unique and lots of fun. But make sure to go with a native friend who has experience. I am from Delhi. 

2. Visit the mountains in the north. Go trekking. If any of you want recommendations on hiking companies then feel free to DM me.

3. Visit the south, I highly recommend the backwaters in Kerala.

4. Visit Rajasthan, a state with incredibly unique culture with everything from architecture, food, music and clothing. But do NOT visit the big cities like Jaipur. They aren’t worth it. 

5. Hit up some national parks. I recommend Kaziranga, Gir national park etc. 

6. The northeast is beautiful and you will never find culture like you find in certain places there, like Shillong and Nagaland. 

7. Continue on to Nepal or Bhutan.

Edit: I love the big cities in India. I love the chaos, the architecture, the food, everything. However it can be overwhelming and even dangerous for a solo traveler who doesn’t have an Indian companion. I’d like to add that as a woman I never go out alone even though I grew up in Delhi.

Edit 2: I didn’t expect so many people to read this! I’d I’d known I’d have gone into more detail. Thank you to all the folks in the comments who did that! Apologies if some of what I said came off as negative- I was really just trying to respond to people on this sub who described why they didn’t like the big cities in earlier threads.",solotravel,ivyraveneve

5000 km (25 day) road trip through TURKEY in 2021 [ITINERARY REVIEW],"Not sure about the exact timeline of this trip for obvious reasons, but in 2021 I intend to go all around Turkey and visit a lot of major historical sites on the way

I used Rome2Rio to get a rough idea of how I will make this trip around Turkey starting at Istanbul and ending at Istanbul. My planned trip will be around 25 days (my visa will only be valid for 30 days max due to my nationality), but if you count up the days in my itinerary, you'll notice they  add up to 20-23 days. Transportation doesn't seem to be the most reliable in Eastern Turkey, and based on previous experiences in the Balkans, I am expecting to miss a few connections and spend a few extra nights at someplaces. I am trying to avoid flights but will take one if absolutely necessary (I am not near Istanbul the end of the trip). This probably looks like a LOT for a month, but I have traveled at this pace before and I sleep like a baby in overnight transportation, so I don't usually get tired from fast-paced trips

# Where I need help/suggestions

1. If you see my route going past a cool spot that I haven't listed, please let me know, and I will see if I can squeeze it into the itinerary
2. If you see any of my plans based on false assumptions about transport/places that are not open, please correct me
3. If you have any experience traveling between cities in **Eastern Turkey**, suggestions/pointers on transport and accommodation will be highly appreciated
4. If anyone knows about the visa-process of taking a ferry to Northern Cyprus, would appreciate input on that. I will have a single entry Turkish visa so wouldn't wanna visit Northern Cyprus if I can't get back into Turkey. I haven't included it in the itinerary because it looks too confusing
5. If there are things I am not sure about, I have highlighted questions in **bold**

In need of some encouragement,"I have been working for many years to make one of my childhood dreams, to solo travel the world, a possibility. As I get closer to achieving that I am starting to feel insurmountably discouraged, and hoping the community here can remind me why this is a worthwhile effort in the first place.

I started school at 20 having worked in retail through the worst of the ‘08 recession and wanting a better life. I graduated at 25 with $80k in student loan debt, and started working my ass off to have some hope of paying that off so I could travel before I get too old. Now at 30, I am actually six months away from being debt free!

However these 10 years have taken much more of an emotional and physical toll than I wanted. I paid my loans by working my ASS off at a very corporate Fortune 500 company, moving every year or two to live at our construction sites. My hair is falling out and I am becoming increasingly sad every year that I make a group of friends only to leave them behind when I move to the next project. All of my coworkers are very conservative people who have hardly left the USA, let alone as free-wheeling solo travelers, so whenever I bring up my dreams I just sound like a crazy child. Everybody around me just asks why don’t I buy a house, worry about my credit score and 401k, etc.

I just can’t ignore how positive my travel experiences have been. I find myself an infinitely more compassionate, thoughtful, and patient person when I am free on the road. My ‘fantasy’ is to solo travel indefinitely, without any sort of schedule or agenda and understand the world outside of the constructs imposed on us. I would like to redefine my life outside of the confines of the corporate world and the ‘American dream’.

Also I am really not confident I want to live or raise children in the USA. This has been an incredibly difficult place to be a middle class person and I don’t want my children to be preyed on by moneyed interests the way I have been. I believe that many places in the world are actually much more ‘free’ and I want to open my eyes to that.",solotravel,oaklicious

Me. My dog. And my Honda Civic. Feb-May 2021,"I work for Amazon (totally remote, flexible hours). I relocated to Seattle in March 2020 just as everything started to shut down.

So here is my idea. My lease is up in February 2021. I have plenty of income. Why not pick a few of these ~$1500/month all inclusive AirBNB places around the country while working remote and solo travel from place to place? It would still be cheaper than the rent in Seattle.

"Trip report: Three trips in New South Wales, Australia","I usually take an overseas holiday each year, but that's legally prohibited for Australians for the foreseeable future due to the pandemic. Instead, I made three road trips around the state of New South Wales from my home town of Canberra over August and September. I'm posting a trip report to share my experiences for the interest of other Australians.

**Trip 1: Canberra to Dubbo**

I took two weeks off in August, with plans to spend most of this time in Sydney. However, due to a COVID outbreak in Sydney at the time, the Australian Capital Territory Government strongly advised Canberrans to avoid the city and holiday in areas of NSW with no COVID cases. As a result, I booked a two day trip to the regional city of Dubbo, which is best known for being home to the vast Western Plains Zoo (the sister zoo to the famous Taronga Zoo in Sydney), and left the next day.

This was my first solo road trip anywhere, and I really enjoyed the experience. The drive to Dubbo was lengthy, but very scenic. I stopped in at Cowra, where I had my first cafe lunch since March and visited the remnants of the World War II prisoner of war camp (not very interesting) and the Japanese cemetery (fascinating).

I spent almost all of the next day at Western Plains Zoo, which was fantastic. Unfortunately due to COVID restrictions the keeper talks and animal feeding sessions had been cancelled, but there were good video versions of the keeper talks for about half of the displays. I drove home the next day via Parkes, where I visited the famous radio telescope (aka 'The Dish') and had the largest hamburger I've ever eaten for lunch.

Overall, this was a fantastic trip. I really wished that I'd allocated at least another couple of days to it to visit more of the towns in this region as there was a lot to see.

**Trip 2: Canberra to Wollongong**

With COVID advisories still in place for Sydney, I decided to spend some of the next week of my leave in the largest city in the world Canberrans were able to freely visit at the time: the coastal city of Wollongong! (population 300,000).

I drove up via the pretty coastal town of Kiama, where it's blowhole was in fine form due to heavy seas. I spent the afternoon walking around Wollongong's spectacular beach and charmless business district.

I spent the next morning at the Historical Aircraft Restoration Society's facilities at an airport to the south of Wollongong. This was much better than I was expecting, as all visitors are given a guided tour (largely for OH&amp;S reasons) and it had a huge collection of well maintained planes. Some of the aircraft visitors are usually able to enter were unavailable due to social distancing restrictions, but I was able to tour their ex-Qantas Boeing 747. After lunch I visited the Nan Tien Temple, which is one of the largest Buddhist temples in Australia - it was huge, but not terribly interesting.

This was also a fun trip. Two days was about enough though.

**Trip 3: Canberra to Sydney**

In September the advisory against visiting Sydney was eased when case numbers dropped to very low levels, so I took half a week off and headed up there. As Canberra hadn't had any COVID cases for months and there is almost no use of face masks (with the local government not requiring this in any circumstances), visiting Sydney was a novelty in that the NSW Government was strongly encouraging people to wear face marks on public transport and other places where maintaining social distancing was difficult.

I spent much of my time visiting family, but also rattled around the city. Take-up of face masks seemed to be at around 50% on public transport and lower levels in most other places. Several art galleries I visited were very strongly encouraging visitors to wear marks. I wore mine whenever I was in public transport, cramped shops and at other locations where doing so was requested or seemed sensible. The absence of foreign tourists was very noticeable, and depressing, with Circular Quay and the Opera House area being almost deserted in the middle of the day.

I also enjoyed this trip. The COVID restrictions were sensible, and were working well.

**Conclusions**

These three trips really helped me to get my confidence back regarding travelling outside of Canberra and eating in cafes and restaurants following our lockdown period. It was possible to enjoy the trips while still following COVID safe practices. Contingent on COVID case numbers remaining very low, I'm looking forward to further travel around Australia now that most of the internal border restrictions have been eased or removed.",solotravel,Appropriate_Volume
My first solo travel experience!!!,"First solo travel experience!!

Hey guys I just wanted to chime in and talk about the trip I went on this past weekend! 

With Covid going on it’s been a pretty dull year so far but I wanted to try and do something safely. I live in NJ and decided to drive to Virginia to go camping in the Shenandoah valley. While down there I visited the Luray caverns which I must say were absolutely beautiful and I fell in love with Shenandoah National park. 

This was the first solo trip I ever went on! On top of that this is the first time I’ve ever gone camping too! I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t anxious and nervous approaching it. I was a little scared that I would end up not liking it and just sucking it up telling people it was great. 

My experience truly was incredible! I finally understand all the love and hype for solo travel that I’ve been looking into for months. I felt so at peace the entire time. It was such a good feeling knowing everything I was doing, was literally what I wanted to do. There were no arguments about what to do or any of the other typical situations with group trips. 

I’m so excited for things to improve in the world so I can travel a little more openly and start this solo travel journey! 

I love all of your posts in this sub, they truly make me excited for what is out there. 

Also before the negativity comes in with traveling during Covid. I actually took a Rapid test today which came back negative and I am quarantining until my PCR test results come back!

How do you deal with your family back home?,"I’m sure majority of people here are around the ages of 18-35, some probably even older. I’m in my 20s, and come from a family where we are all really close. All my brothers and parents live in the same city and see each other frequently.  I solo travelled once, it was for a 2 voluntary day work conference in London, and I decided to stay instead for a week so I can have fun afterwards. I was always interested in being to a new country alone and thought this was the perfect opportunity to start. My parents were very uneasy with me going alone, they wanted my brothers to come with me. My brothers never solo travelled either, only trips they taken were family trips. It was a battlefield trying to convince them that I needed this for work (even though it was voluntary but I made it seem like it was a must) and since my brothers weren’t able to just get up and come with me, my parents finally accepted. While I was in London my mom was practically texting me throughout the day and we talked on the phone every night. When I came back my dad told me in secret that that week was the most he’s ever seen my mom stressed out, but that he was proud that I got a new city experience lol

"3ish Month Trip, Need Suggestions Given The Following Situation","I appreciate any thoughts. The post is long, but I wanted to give context.

Background: Late 20s Male. Mech eng, former US service member(lived and traveled overseas). 1800/month passive income. No expenses. No debt. At or above US averages for my age in cash and in 401k. 

The Situation: In the next few weeks I'll be negotiating a raise that I believe I deserve and discussing my future at the company long term. I don't want to get bogged down too much on these details, but the important part is I live in NJ and if significant raises or promotions don't seem likely in the next 5 years then I'm bailing on NJ due to the cost of living. 

The Question Preface: If this scenario plays out(seems likely) and covid has died down a bit by Spring/Summer 2021 I would like to take my time in finding a new job. My criteria for a new location leaves the vast majority of the US open. My thinking is whether I am in NJ or any other place with internet I can work on finding a job and applying, plus after my lease is up I'll have nowhere to live(I'm getting rid of pretty much everything I own"")

The Actual Question: Where can I live(outside US) for 1800 usd/month? I'd dip into savings if I wanted to do day trips etc. 

Requirements: Costal. Reliable internet. Not completely off grid, but not in the heart of a major city"". Need a private room. Hostel is fine, but private room required. Car not required. 

Research thus far: I've found a lot of the ""10 cheapest places to retire"" lists have been a good start. 

Cascais, Portugal- Has anyone been here? It seems nearly too good to be true. I like the fact that I'm in easy train shot to Lisbon and could walk from my room to the beach, supermarket, downtown. 

Cartagena, Colombia- I'm struggling to research if there is a suburb with easy access to the city. I don't really want to be ""in-in"" the city or any major city. Any experience anyone?

Mancora, Peru- The articles surrounding here either talk about it being a big party town or sleepy town, I'm assuming it is seasonal, any thoughts?

Typical day- I wake up and grab a local coffee/espresso with a light walk. Go back to my room, research jobs, areas, and tailor resumes for 2-4 hours. Eat lunch then go for a rigorous workout. Explore local area, read at the beach maybe get involved in some sort of group activity or learning(language, yoga, painting).

Typical Friday/Saturday- Enjoy the local bar playing music, maybe there are vacationers or expats or locals I can chat with over a beer. I'm fine with partying, but I'm not looking for a Cancun/Ibiza spring break deal.

Sunday- Take public transport to check out whatever.

The purpose of this trip is to unwind, plan, enjoy, and help me decide what I want. 

Any tips on locations to consider or comments on this whole idea?",solotravel,VkayWarrior
Preparing for first solo trip-Arizona,"F(23) this is going to be my first ever solo trip! I decided to go to Arizona! So far itinerary is

Future Travel Plans to Europe - Spitballing - Help,"&amp;#x200B;

[A start.](https://preview.redd.it/vvt1cka18au51.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a2127d3769e5f513983e5191541b1175a25434db)

TL;DR Budget of \~$5,000 trying to stretch across three months seeing as much as possible while hitting some spots to paintball along the way.

&amp;#x200B;

Dear Solo Travelers, 

OK so I am starting to get a little overwhelmed while planning this trip. That's why I've come to this great community for help!

So I may be planning this a little early but I'm trying to get my ducks in a row for this upcoming summer. I have roughly $5000 maybe $7000 to spend on this trip and I'm trying to make it last for as close to 3 months as possible. 

This will be my first trip outside the U.S. so I hope to see as many places without being extremely rushed. That's why I'm shooting for a 3 month time frame. I also hope to hit a few of the paintball places on the map above. I think it would be really cool to paintball in a few different countries along the way.

I hope to pack as light as possible and hit hostels/couch surf almost the whole way. Along with the paintball stops I hope to stop in Istanbul and Slovakia to meet up with some friends. 

So I guess my question is how to I proceed to make a coherent plan where I'm able to paintball, meet my buddies, hit a few major ""attractions"", and explore local villages while staying on budget and staying as long as possible?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for all the help!

Solo travel films?,"I know we're all about getting out into the world to explore it, but with the restrictions of quarantining I've been watching a lot of movies. I recently saw Summertime (1955) with Katherine Hepburn. Given how old it is, I was surprised by how relevant it felt. It's about an old maid who travels alone to Venice. The main plot is about her falling in love (of course), but what I found compelling was how it really felt like solo travel. Katherine Hepburn's character has all the anxiety and adventure that I've felt when travelling. And the cinematography made me feel as if I was exploring the city.

**Places I've Travelled To:**

Domestic around the US to big cities and rural areas. I love everything from rural PA to downtown Chicago.

**Length:**

8-10 days

**Budget:**

I've been saving for a while, all in I wouldn't mind spending $3k (including flights/hotels)

**Interests:**

Sightseeing, nature, museums, tourist attractions, eating local Mexican food, walking/boat tours, partying. Someone recommended teotihuacan, and that looks right up my alley. My loose plan is to sight see/try new places to eat during the day and go out at night.

**Accommodation:**

I was originally considering staying in a hostel (Hostal Regina Centro Historico), but that's not the smartest idea so I'll most likely do AirBnB or hotel. Will tinder be good for meeting people? **Are there any must see places if you're in Mexico City?**

Thanks everyone!

How to plan travel around meeting locals and other travelers?,"So I see lots of posts here with folks mentioning things like visiting a new country for, say, a month, and making local friends with whom they still stay in contact. Or getting invited into a local's home for tea and dinner. Or spending the day with a local, or exploring with other travelers, etc.

I'm wondering how people find themselves in these situations? One of my favorite things when traveling is meeting locals and just hearing about their perspective; I feel like I come away from it with a deeper understanding of the place I just visited.

I also enjoy meeting fellow travelers for similar reasons, just to learn about their experiences and, I suppose, expose myself to a more diverse array of people than I would meet here in the US.

The problem with me is I'm fairly introverted. I'm not shy per se, and will try to strike up others in a hostel, for example, but if I sense a cold reception on their part then I get discouraged and withdraw, not wanting to bother them.

On top of this, I usually plan my day around visiting cool landmarks, sites, restaurants, etc. but this activity isn't super conductive to meeting others, because it feels weird to be at a temple, for example, and cold approach a stranger to just start conversing with no context. 

So far, this has been my experience, where the people I reach out to seem to not care to have anything to do with me, whether that be a group of travelers fine on being amongst themselves, or locals who don't want to interact with a foreigner.

I try and respect their space in these cases, but I can't help but wonder how people on this sub end up having such rich experiences with those they meet traveling? How do you plan your trips, and orient your daily activities, lodging, etc. to facilitate the process of meeting new people as much as possible?",solotravel,TheAbLord
I have six months to travel,"If all goes well, I'm starting university in September 2021. In January I'm quitting my job and I want to travel. I've got six months. I've got a European passport and I plan to use it.

1 travel to a country e.g. Sweden and try to get a job for those six months. This would be ideal if any of the swedish universities I've applied to accepts me. The other plus is that I get to make more money than I spend. However it's probably shitty of me to get a job and quit six months in right?

What was your most memorable trip in pre-COVID 2019-2020 and what specifically would you recommend to your friends or solo travellers?,"Hey everyone,

Since not a lot of us are current travelling at the moment, thought it might be nice to reminisce about a recent travel experience while also helping to share some recommendations for people planning to travel there in the future.

**What was a memorable trip that you recently took? Are there any specific places or activities that stood out that you'd highlight to other travellers?**

I'll start! One of my favourite trips was to **Kauai, Hawaii**. I love being in the outdoors and so the activities here were perfectly suited for that. I haven't been to the other islands, but had such a great experience here I might just want to come back.

* **Transportation**: The entire island is extremely small; however, in order to make the most of it, it is highly recommended that you rent a car. This will allow you to drive to parts of the island in 1-2h. Although I would have loved to get a Jeep - you really don't need one (unless you're going to some off-road terrain) and can save money by renting a regular car.
* **Food**: Really enjoyed lots of food trucks and snacks! Recommend:
   * **The Fish Express**: This was the best poke I had (tried several locations, and only found this on the last day).
   * **Trucking Delicious**: Delicious coconut shrimp
   * **Wailua Shave Ice**: Shave ice was great here (and its different than the regular shaved ice you think of at carnivals /snowcones).
   * **Java Kai**: Think smoothie bowls and avo toast.
* **Activities:**
   * **Hiking:** Tons of great trails with all different types of scenery and lengths. Check out AllTrails app.
   * **Surfing:** I'm an absolute beginner and went to the south area (since I was advised against going to the north during the Winter season). There was a nice area next to the Sheraton which was beginner friendly. Didn't want to take a lesson since I'd taken one before and just wanted to mess around with a board. **Kauai Surf School** (I think) rented boards for $10/h. :) Am sure there were other areas where you could also rent a board but I liked that this was on the water and you could easily see where other people were trying to catch waves.",solotravel,TravoShare

Basically my question is: I've got atleast 1 year to prepare myself and to minimise the impact to my financial health due to not earning an income for such a long time. I don't intend to end up broke after all of this - infact im hoping to only spend 15-20k during my travels but i haven't sat down and done the maths, i just pulled that number out of my ass...What should I be doing in preparation for this trip and what should i be doing while im travelling.",solotravel,skinnybg
"After COVID, I want to quit my job and solo travel long-term. Am I crazy?","I graduated college last year in May. I’ve been working full time since and have saved up about $45k. By the time COVID is over and travel is fully opened and welcomed again, I estimate I can grow that to around $60-75k depending on how long it takes. 
 
I’m 25 M. I have a decent job making around $50k/yr. Can double my salary if I stay with the company for another 5 years. But I hate it. I don’t hate the company, I don’t hate the people, I don’t hate the job. I hate feeling like I’m wasting my life sitting in an office doing things that I don’t want to be doing.

All I have ever been told in life is go to school, get a good job, buy a house, get married, and have kids.

I have a college education, I have a good job, I rent my own house, I have a beautiful girlfriend. And yet, I’m certainly not satisfied. The only thing I’m missing is the kids, and I don’t want any, but I’m pretty confident a child won’t make me happy either. 

I want to explore the world beyond the suburbs that my great grandparents, grandparents, parents and now myself have lived and worked in our entire lives. I want to experience different cultures and see new perspectives. I want to explore something bigger than myself. I want to overcome my fears and anxiety. I want to develop and grow into a stronger individual. I want to learn to love myself fully and be comfortable alone. Solo travel seems to satisfy all of these. Right? 

It’s so easy to get comfortable. Then before you know it, 15 years go by, you are 40 years old with kids, a wife, a mortgage. You are no longer living for yourself. You live to support others. There’s nothing wrong with this lifestyle if it makes you happy. 

I am at a very crucial point in my life where I need to decide which road I am going to take. 

I’m still young, I have no kids, the only debt I have is 20k in student loans ($250/monthly), I rent, my car is paid for, I have a good amount of savings. One or many of these things may change in the next 5 years. 

So I ask from anyone who has taken the jump, can you please share your wisdom and experience? How much money did you have saved up when you left? What is/was your long-term game plan after cash reserves dry up? How long are you going to live the lifestyle and what is the plan after? Where did you go? Can you give me any advice specific to my situation? 

Would you do it all over again?

EDIT: This post turned into great discussion and I truly appreciate everyone’s kind words and motivation. I really needed it. I want to thank everyone for their input. It has been invaluable to me. 

After reading a majority of the comments, I want to address a few of the most asked questions: 

1. Why haven’t you paid off your student loan debt? 

I’ve heavily considered it. I decided not to because the interest rates are low (3.5%). All federal loans. Meaning, I could invest the same amount of money that I would use to pay it off, earn 7% interest in the market, and profit the 3.5% spread. BUT if I’m going to be traveling long-term, I really don’t want to deal with it or have to worry about it at all. So I will more than likely pay it off before I leave. 

2. Is my girlfriend coming with me?

No. My girlfriend is awesome, don’t get me wrong. But this is something I need to do alone. Our relationship is still new. We aren’t on the cusp of getting married or anything. And she knows this is something I am considering. I’ve been transparent from the start. 

3. How did I save so much in that amount of time? 

Zero expenses. Well not zero, but pretty damn close. I was living with my dad for 17 of the past 18 months after I graduated. I just started renting at the beginning of this month. I paid nothing in rent, nothing in utilities, student loans have been deferred due to COVID, I own my car. The only expenses I had were my phone bill, car insurance, and whatever food/activities I wanted to spend money on. This allowed me to save almost all of my income. I also worked for my dad occasionally to earn some extra cash whenever I could. I realize not everyone has this opportunity. I am forever grateful that I did.

4. Can you work remotely? Is your industry easy to get back into? 

Yes and yes. My job can be done 100% remotely and there are plenty of companies in this industry that I could seek employment from with my experience. Unfortunately, my boss is old fashioned and conservative in his ways and wants everyone in the office 5 days a week. 

That being said, and with all of the helpful advice and wise words people have given me, I have laid out a new game plan:

Continue working and saving for at least the next year. This will allow me to build up more experience, put away some more cash into my reserve fund, and pay off my loans. I’ll be able to stick it out for another year. Hopefully by then COVID will have passed and people will be welcoming of foreign travelers again. 

I will then propose to my boss that I continue working for the company on a part time basis 100% remotely so I can travel and have some of my time back. If he declines, I quit and travel on my reserve cash for awhile keeping expenses low and living frugally. 

Once I need to start making an income again, I will look for a 100% remote position in my current industry. It shouldn’t be hard to find. If that doesn’t work, I will use some of the other great tips in this thread for making an income while traveling like online tutoring or teaching english.

I’m sorry I was not able to respond to many of you. I have been busy with work (ironic lol). Hopefully this update will be sufficient. Thank you again to everyone who commented and for your kind words! You truly have made this decision so much easier. The leap does not seem nearly as intimidating after hearing all of the great stories about how it worked out for people and how they did not regret it for a second. 

Much love everyone! May we all satisfy our deepest desires and live a life of fulfillment and meaning!",solotravel,LifeQuestionsMe
I need a break in the UK,"I'm a PhD student just entering my second year. I'm doing some teaching but it's conducted 100% online, and my area is basically philosophy, so as long as I have my laptop and Kindle I can basically work from anywhere.

The last few months have been... shit, to say the least. My dad suffered a spinal injury affecting his mobility, was sent a cancer screening test, my mum was diagnosed with a heart condition, my partner of 4.5 years' father had a stroke, my brother lost his job, I had to move out of my flat near the university because I couldn't find affordable nearby accommodation, and I'm now meant to be doing teaching and research at the same time. All the while, I can't travel to Vienna and live there for a few months as I hoped to - so the alternative is probably somewhere here in the UK.

I need a break. I need to get away somewhere quiet and beautiful, with some nice cafes I can just read or write on my laptop, some pubs to get a pint in the evening, and nature so I can get some fresh air and just get away from all my worries. The thing is, I don't know where to go. I've always wanted to spend some time in Edinburgh, but Airbnb doesn't show anything remotely affordable for me. I was hoping to spend maybe 3 weeks away somewhere new and different, maybe spend about £500 on accommodation. But I'm not sure where to go. I'd love to spend some more time in the lovely Yorkshire villages, but I just don't know where to go.

Does anyone have any recommendations? I'm not sure whether I should be looking on Airbnb or [Booking.com](https://Booking.com) or hostelworld or something else.

Might be worth mentioning that I don't drive but I'm very happy to get a train. And I'll probably be based in York by the time I can realistically do this.

I'd really appreciate anyone's help or advice on this one.",solotravel,unevenclimate
To be Solo Travellers - ever worry if you've completely romanticised the idea of solo travel and maybe you'll find one day its not for you?,"This is a worry I have a lot. I haven't had the means and opportunity yet to just take the leap with solo travel and see if its everything I've ever wanted. And dont get me wrong, despite my fears, I still definitely wish to do it as soon as I can. 

But I've been into the idea of solo travel for a really long time now; subscribed to here, read solo travel literature, watched vlogs etc and the whole idea is something thats always excited me. I've even influenced friends and coworkers who've had the means to go and do it and they've always been thankful. 

In general I enjoy solo activities like eating at nice restaurants alone, going to the cinema alone etc -- and yet I cant shake this feeling theres a chance I wouldn't enjoy solo travelling. The only travelling I'm use to is with friends and family. And now I'm just worried I've built up the idea of it so much, its not that it wont live up to my expectation, but that I wont enjoy it as much as if I had company. 

Not to be cheesy but this problem at some point reminded me of that one quote from Tangled: 

&gt; Rapunzel: I’ve been looking out of a window for eighteen years, dreaming about what I might feel like when those lights rise in the sky. What if it’s not everything I dreamed it would be?

&gt; Flynn Rider: It will be.

&gt; Rapunzel: And what if it is? What do I do then?

&gt; Flynn Rider: Well,that’s the good part I guess. You get to go find a new dream.

Which has provided me some hope that, as soon as I do take that first leap into solo travel, I'll find it intoxicating and will jump into another adventure. 

But I guess my question for the community is two:

1) are there any other 'to be solo travellers' who also lurk here and feel similarly?

2) and for people who have solo travelled and felt like this before, what were your first time solo travel experiences like?

Edit: thank you all so much! The responses have been overwhelming and you guys have been a massive help and comfort. So much practical advice and helpful antidotes &lt;3",solotravel,gkbbb
Trip planning for June 2021,"Hi everyone,

I  am considering going on a solo-backpacking trip in either June or July  2021 (assuming COVID blows over). So far I am looking at two regions:  Southeast Asia or South America. If I go to Southeast Asia I would like  to try and buy a motorcycle and take a month to month and a half long  trip through Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. If I go to South America, I was  thinking Chile, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Brazil. Any advice on  what to do, suggested routes, etc?

So far I have traveled to twenty countries and territories spanning North America, Europe, Far East, Central America, West Africa and the Caribbean. I am pretty experienced with travel in a variety of places from developed to undeveloped countries so I think I would do well in either region. I also speak decent Spanish but I do not know any Portuguese. Will that be a problem for South America? I have a month to a month and a half to work with (early June 2021 to mid July 2021) so I have enough time to get around either area I think. I should have a budget of a few thousand USD for this trip.

Any and all help or advice is appreciated.

"Tokyo, Japan advice?","Hi!

Next April, given corona virus is a bit less mad, I have to go to Tokyo for business.  
I'll be there for 3 days of work, where my flights/hotel will be sorted for me. But I've decided to take 5 days off and just stay for leisure. I'll have to pay for my hotel at this point so I think I'll change hotels if anyone has any decently priced suggestions! 

these aren't the actual dates but I find it easier to think like this :) 

Here is my plan:

1st - Get into Tokyo at 11:30 local time, travel to my hotel then spend the afternoon exploring the general area and getting food. I imagine I'll be super tired after a long travel day and to be back resting quite early given I'm working for a few days!

2nd -  Conference  
3rd - Conference  
4th - Conference  - with these days I imagine we may go out for drinks etc in the evening. We finish at around 6 - 7pm but I'll make no plans!

5th - Switch hotels, either my new hotel can keep my luggage (hotels in the UK do this) or I'll pay for a locker.  
Yoyogi park , Meiji shrine. Wander around Shibuya

6th - Seibu centre and Pokemon Center mega store, Animate store, Bandai building

7th - Odaiba, rainbow bridge, museum, general shopping in some cool stores there

8th - Disney Tokyo - I know, extremely touristy but theme parks are a joy for me. Spending a full day in Tivoli, Copenhagen is one of my fondest memories

9th - Flight at 1pm 

&amp;#x200B;

**Some concerns:**

I could stay another couple of days, the cost would be pretty minimal if I had a decently priced hotel. But I need to decide before next month when they book my flights

What car to buy for a year long US solo road trip?,"Good evening, I am a 24 year old male who just feels really lost and today I just put in my 2 weeks leaving a comfortable well pay job to go travel the US solo for some soul searching. 

I am in NYC right now and my plan is to sell my car and then drive west and hop around all the different ski resorts for the winter and then once winter ends go on a hugeeeee national park backpacking tour, spending 2–7 days at each place. Right now the highlights I am 100% going to see is glacier, Yellowstone, redwood, Tetons, arches, Zion, Yosemite, Joshua tree, Bryce cannon, grand canon, smoky mountains, and Acadia. I’m open to other suggestions too!

I’m looking for a car for this extensive trip and money is no concern. It has to handle really well in snow and the mountains and be comfortable for longgggg drives. I don’t need too much cargo room because I’m only bringing my backpacking set up and then probably a clone of it just in case equipment gets damaged or lost.

I know nothing about cars, but was thinking of getting either a fully loaded outback and probably some aftermarket rims and tires and a set of snow tires, or a Range Rover (my favorite car)  with some snow tires but I’ve heard iffy things regarding reliability. I’m open to all suggestions, thanks!",solotravel,WormBurner72
Solo hiking and camping,"Last week I did some solo hiking in the mountains near me. I was staying at a hostel near me which was great and I had people to talk to every night. I also enjoyed hiking alone because I could go my own speed. I even went to a winery tasting alone which was pretty nice too because I flirted with the waiter the whole time. 

However I didn't like eating alone at restaurants. And when I went for an overnight backpacking trip, I found that I don't enjoy camping alone. This was super surprising to me because I'm usually very reserved and I don't mind my own company. I live alone and never get lonely but if I go out to the woods, suddenly I'm wishing for conversation.

Budget: hostel: $33 a night. I made most of my meals. Gas to get there was probably my biggest expense.


Trip Length: 5 nights

Destination(s): New Hampshire white mountains.



Accommodation: The Notch Hostel. One of the best hostels I've stayed at.

Have you ever bottled up something bad that happened to you during solo traveling?,"Sorry if that’s a confusing title.

I’ve always loved to solo travel, but as a young women, my desire to do this was always met with skepticism and fear. My family discourages my traveling because they don’t believe it’s safe for a woman to travel alone. Before I left for my first trip, my mom called and begged me to reconsider, even offering to reimburse all the money I spent. I almost caved just because I hated how upset she was, but went through with it and had a great time. My friends think it’s odd and kinda dangerous as well but they’re supportive. 

Solo traveling opened up the world to me in such an incredible way and I fell in love with it. I also used every precaution to keep myself safe and it was always enough...until it wasn’t. I was sexually assaulted on my last trip to a European country that most would consider very safe. I’m ashamed to admit this, but I never reported the attack. It’s a long road to recovery, but I do believe that I’ve made a lot of progress in overcoming this. 

I still can’t bring myself to tell anyone I know about the attack. Not my parents. Not my best friend. Not even my current boyfriend (it occurred before we got together). Every time I try, it’s like my throat closes up and I physically cannot force the words out. I just don’t want them to know they were *right*. That the worst thing they warned me could happen actually happened. Despite everything, I do desperately want to conquer this and get back out into the world, but that’s still such a terrifying concept to me now. If I tell them, they’ll have all the ammo they’ll ever need to keep me ‘grounded’. It would just take a mention of the incident to have me canceling my flight. 

And reading over this, I realize it’s pretty heavy stuff for this sub. I’m sorry to dump it all out like that, but I needed to get it out somewhere, and I worried that any other forum would warn me against traveling solo ever again. I’m hoping no one else has ever been in a similar situation, but have you ever felt the same fear of telling people when your solo travels go wrong? And if your travels did go wrong, how did you build yourself up again to resume them?

"Some thoughts on Eurail pass usage in FR, DE, Austria area. Seeking experiences in Benelux/Spain/Italy/Poland/Nordic countries","Germans are meticulous when checking Eurail passes, French people seem to mainly not give a fuck.

Things that you can get away on French trains but not on German trains:

- Booking an interrail reservation instead of a eurail reservation to get into the French trains where gates check the codes in big stations like Paris East
- Conductors that check your pass maybe 1 in 4 trains you take.
- Conductors that look at the cover of your pass and don't open it
- Conductors that look at the journeys of your pass rather than the ""X days"" on the top of the pass that really counts when you have a pass that is say, 10 days out of a month
- Conductors that look at your reservation without looking at your eurail pass
- Conductors that are cool when you give them a eurail pass but never check that you have a reservation

The Austrian version of that is similar to the German version but less intense. My hypothesis is that Germany is a bigger supporter of the train passes (unified EU/economy reasons) while France is less supportive. I am curious as to whether there are differences between countries I would lump in such categories: strict (Germany/Austria/Benelux area?) and relaxed (France, Spain, Italy)",solotravel,minGeselleChumetNiet

[Report] 7 days in Catalunya after 4 months in Madrid (Sept 2019).,"A year ago, I took my first solo trip : a 7-days trip in Catalunya, Spain. Here's a report. It's been a year ago, so I might not remember every detail, sorry for that. 

I'll speak about my first days spent in Barcelona and how I managed to loose a friend there (F**k alcohol!). Then how I spent the rest of the days in different idylic little villages by myself, how I felt and how my feelings evolved. Also worth to say that end of september was a good period to go, as the weather was around the 25-30°C and there were not many tourists anymore (or at least outside of Barcelona).

Before going on that 7-days trip, I spent 4 months in Madrid for my work. This is not the main topic, but I'll write a few lines on it, because why not? I'll also use Madrid as point of comparison later. 

So, in May 2019 I was sent to Madrid for a 4 months mission to install the first Protontherapy center in Madrid. I really loved that city. The vibes, the architecture, the parks, ... really pleased me. I'd love to go back. I enjoyed it much more than Barcelona. 

There are so much things to see there, the Retiro Park with the Crystal Palace, the Prado Museum, all the nice buildings along Gran Via. If you can spend a few days there, I highly recommend.

The only thing I did not like so much there are the crowds and the heat. That goddammned heat. 47°C in full sun in july, still 36°C at 4am. Can't even go from one bar to another without getting all sweaty. 

Let's go to the Catalunya trip part now. 

BARCELONA
--------------

I spent the first 3 days in Barcelona. To reach it, I took a high speed train from Madrid, which lasted about 2hours and was fairly affordable. 

Once arrived there, I brought my stuff to the Airbnb I booked and went on to visit the city. Like everybody (I guess?), I visited the legacy of Antonio Gaudi, with the Güel Park (cheap entrance).
I then went to visit the gothic neighborhood. I really really liked it, but be sure to visit it during the day, as it's apparently not that safe when the sun goes down. 

On the first day, in the evening, I was meeting a girl-friend who was my colleague in my first job. She was there on holidays with her boyfriend who seems like a very nice guy. I had a crush a few years ago on that girl and was genuinly thinking it was from the past, but apparently alcohol decided otherwise. I apparently said stupid things, and she does not talk to me anymore. I'll pass you the details, but you can imagine that my trip was not off to a good start. 

The next day, I visited the Casa Balto (20€ entrance). The Casa Balto entrance fee is definitely not cheap, but it's worth it. This house is simply amazing. I originally did not want to pay that much but the friend saw the day before had convinced me to go and I'm glad I did. I recommend to also check the other Gaudi houses, even if only from outside, as they are quite grandiose. 

Unfortunately, I could not see the inside of the Sagrada Familia. The tickets need to be booked well in advance or you need to go early enough to have day-tickets (limited amount). 

The Barcelonetta beach is also quite nice, lots of little bars where you can take a drink or food and contemplate the sea. I was lucky enough that in the end of september there was not many tourists left, but the weather was still more than good. 

I also visited the Ciutadella park and a few markets.

Then on the last day,  I just walked around the city, feeling like I'd do whatever I liked and my feet took me to the Picasso Museum. Also really worth it, as you can discover the evolution of the life of the artist. It might actually surprise you. 

I then went on to Barcelona Airport to pick up a rental car to continue on my journey. 

Overall, I did not enjoy Barcelona that much. It sure is a beautifull city, as long as you stay in the touristic neighbourhood. As I said, I particularly like the Gothic quarter. But I feel like as soon as you step out of those areas, all the magic goes away. The appartement blocks are ugly and there's no charm whatsoever. It's just like any major city. Rush and disrespect. 

Here's the comparison I'll make with Madrid : Madrid, even though it has no beach (I have to concede, Barcelona is very cool for that point), feels much nicer. People feel nicer, and the Architecture is more developped (?!). I don't know if it's the good way to say it. But even far from the center, I still liked some of the traditional charm that spanish appartment blocks have. Even recently build blocks felt that way, where in Barca it just... didn't. 

Also, it's Catalunya and they are proud of it. They don't really like tourists nor Airbnb. They are not faking it and show it clearly with signs almost at every balcony. 


GIRONA
-------

After taking my rental car, I drove to Girona. For Games of Thrones fans, that's an interesting city. It was used to film some parts of Kings Landing and Braavos. 
It actually really feels like a medieval city. The Cathedral is purely grandiose, the Arab Bath are very interesting, the old Castle is beautifull and gives you a nice overview of the city. I loved those little streets, with paved floor where you can just walk with you eyes up and try to catch every detail you can from all the different houses and atmospheres you can feel there. 

I really recommend to go to Girona if you have time. I spent half a day there and enjoyed it a lot. Just take time to drink a Spritz (or whatever suits you) at the bottom of the steps of the cathedral, watch the other tourists just look at this impressive building. Wander in the little streets, cross the bridges and look at all those little houses that are short to fall into the water. 

Just be prepared, that's even more Catalunya than in Barcelona for the nationalism. But it sort of has its charm. 

BEGUR &amp; OTHER VILLAGES
------------------------------

At the end of my half-day in Girona, I took the car and headed to the Begur Area. I dropped my stuff at the hotel I booked. The Hostel Sa Barraca. This was a relatively cheap hotel but with very good value for money (60€/night I think). I especially recommend it for the hosts. It's an old couple, there super adorable. They speak a basic english and french. The breakfast was really nice, and the room very confortable (I had what I think was satin bedsheets, imagine my surprise!). Also, the sunrise there is absolutely stunning. You have a wonderful view on the sea from your room if you are lucky. If you have to pay a bit of extra to have it, just do it. There that holiday feeling when you wake up with the sunrising on the water, you know it's gonna be a good day. It wars your heart. I could just stay there, eating my breakfast and contemplate the scene that was offered to me. 

I stayed for the next 3 days in that Area. The village of Begur is nice. You can access the ruins of the castle  (different from the Castle itself) on foot via the nice little streets in the center of the village. There's quite a bit of history there, with houses inspired from Cuban architecture. 

The next day, I visited some of the most beautifull villages I've ever seen (except maybe this year in Northern Italy, but in a different style). 

If you like old and well preserved little medieval villages, I highly recommend Pals, Peratallada and Pubol. Peratallada was definitively my favorite. There was almost nobody there, but my god it's beautifull. So much peace, colorfull plants on every wall. I could just stay there for a while, thinking about nothing, just staying lost in time, as this village obviously is. 

You don't have to spend much time in those villages, as they are relatively small and close together. It took me half a day to do all three (starting from Begur at 8 am). 

During the afternoon, I drove to the cute little village of Sa Tuna. This is a gem that not many tourist know about. If you like tiny beaches, with crystal clear water, cute little white houses on the sea side and almost no tourist : go there! (also, the Spritz there is cheap...). I took a bit of time to chill on the beach, relax, read my book and I had a swim. After 4 months of very hard work, that's the first swim I had in the sea that summer. Such a wonderfull feeling. THAT, is holidays. Water was quite chilly so I did not stay long.

So, after that wonderfull swim, I took the road again and drove off to Llafranc and Callela Palafrugel (on the beach, not the town itself). Those are two other charming little villages, also with those typical white houses. I again let my feet take me wherever they wanted to. Those are sush beautifull little places ! If only my boss wouldn't have called me while I was peacefully reading my book on the beach to ask me to go somewhere I did not want to go on my return from holidays. I should have just shut my phone. That ruined my moment. But I consolated myselft with nice food after that, which was nice. Tapas, never enough tapas !

The last day was for Figueres and Cadaques. 
Those were on many lists of places to see. Well, Except for the Dali museum which is well worth it, don't spend more time in Figueres. It's nothing special and even food was not that great. 

I went on to Cadaques, which in contrary to Figueres, is absolutely worth it! It's a bit like the other sea side villages with white houses, but slightly bigger. Slightly more narrow streets, more nature. I really enjoyed it. Just stop for an instant, take an ice cream, sit on the edge of the wall above the water, and relax. Look at the sea and do a bit of tourist watching, which can sometimes be fun. 

There also a tiny Dali museum there, but it's not really worth it. I encourage you to just walk at random in the streets and enjoy the vibe. 

In the evening, I took the car back to my hotel, to have a good night of sleep as I had to wake up quite early for quite a special day. 

HOT AIR BALLOON TRIP
--------------------------

I woke up very early as I had to be at 6.30 at the Parc Natural de la Zona Volcànica de la Garrotxa. Why so early? I'm glad you asked! 

Today is the day I was taking a hot air balloon trip over this former volcanic region. They ask you to arrive this early, simply to enjoy climbing in altitude with the sun rising. That was, in my humble opinion, one if not the most epic scene I've ever witnessed. This is absolutely stunning. Imagine one moment. You are in complete darkness. In almost complete silence (except the burner from the hot air balloon breaking it from time to time, but it also warms you up so it's actually appreciated! Also, 3m tall flames are kinda cool.), you are rising above the floor. As you climb up above ground,  far far away, you notice the first slim lights of the day, but they don't reach you yet. 

As you continue climbing up, and the light from the sun is slowly growing, you notice a slight white-ish pellicule of fog sticking to the ground. Only the little hills from the volcanic past of the region are pointing their nose through those tiny clouds. The lights are amplificating. It bounces on the hills and the fog, with a nice and warming orange halo. You are still in silence. Everyone of the 10 people on board is totaly silent and contemplates the beauty of Mother Nature in front of us. Trust me, I have tears coming up my eyes while rememoring this. 

Then, when the sun is up, the pilot of the hot air balloon starts unpacking the ""breakfast"". A glass of champagne and catalan cake. I usually say no to alcohol before noon, but I figured ""oh well, if not now in the magical theatre, when?"". 

Then, he gives you explanations of what's happening, where you are, how to drive that big balloon, and how to land it. He also tells you that depending on the wind, you may or may not go very far. 

It lasted a total of 1h30-ish, of pure contemplation and pure magic. After you land, two 4X4 are coming to pick you up, and the staff kindly asks you to give them a hand to fold the housing of the balloon that has now deflated and lies on the ground like a dead monster. 

Once you do that, they bring you back to the center where you took of from, they round you around a table with everyone that was on board with you and they serve you a true feast! Gosh, I thougt I was gonna explode after so much delicious catalan food! 

After a good hour of eating and listening to stories of the guides, it was time to go and visit the last villages before heading to the airport and go home the next day. Just FYI, I think the hot air balloon trip + the food was a package and costed about 230€ all included. Seems expensive, but well worth it. Once again, the area and the scene were just epic !!! 


LAST HALF DAY
-----------------

During my last afternoon, I visited a few places &amp; villages that were left on my list. I first started by going into a forest not that far from where I did the hot air balloon trip. This area is full of gorges but I unfortunately did not have enough time to do them all. So, I did go to the Gorg del Molí dels Murris. It's a bit less impressive than on many pictures of the internet, especially because there was less water at that time. But I was there for a good 45 minutes, I just sat on the floor and I let any thoughts flow and go, trying not to focus on anything particular. Maybe it was meditation, I don't know, never done that. This felt good and that's all that matters. 

Next, I went to Castlefollit de la roca. Internet pictures are showing a tiny and cute village on the edge of a cliff. Sure, from afar, it's impressing. The village itselft, not so much. I just found it quite ugly, not that interesting and dirty. I think I spent 20 minutes there, then left. I stopped with my car on the way to Besalu as I had the view on Castelfollit on its cliff, which was more interesting. 

Last village I did was Besalu. Really recommend it. You can't miss the old-stone bridge, and the narrow medieval streets of that village. It's worth it to go there if you have time. But don't plan too much as an hour or two are more than enough. Also, don't eat there. I could not find a single restaurant that looked like it was really worth it. 

Which brings me to the very last place I visited during my stay : Olot. If you look on a map, it's true, it's close to where I took the hot air balloon trip, but I my hotel was also there, so it makes sense. I walked around the city for a bit. It's a nice little town and I saw it from above during the hot air balloon trip and it had a nicely shaped form for a city. There's nothing that exceptional about it.  then headed to a tapas restaurant. Then I headed for the last hostel room, which was a nightmare (did not check before, but it was above a bar). Luckily, my night was meant to be short as I had to drive to the airport to be there at 8 in the morning. 

This conclude my report on the trip itself.


MENTAL STATE
----------------

As I mentionned in the beginning of this report, this trip took place directly after very intensive 4 months of work in Madrid. I was truly exhausted both physically and mentally and definitely needed a break. I was slightly afraid of going alone on holidays as it was my first time doing so. I often travel alone for work, but this was different. I did not know what to expect. 

If you've read everything, you'll know by now that my first day of the trip did no go that well, with me loosing a friend (Linea, if you read this... I'm sorry again). Luckily for me (or not), I've had enough drawbacks in my life to be able to go over this quickly enough for the duration of my stay. I'll worry about this when I'll be home. 
The rest of the trip went fine. I sometimes did not really know what to do, I had change of mind regarding what I wanted to see or visit, where to eat. Would the restaurant accept only one person ?(they usually did). 

I discovered that I enjoyed beeing alone with myself, even if sometimes I was missing one or two of my friends in particular. 
I could indeed just do whatever I wanted, just let my feet take me where they wanted. Not get out of bed in the morning if I did not want to. 

This was a good occasion also to reflect on myselft. I haven't discovered anything I did not know, but I kinda understood more of what I already knew. 

I just regret not turning my phone off and checking my professional emails during my stay. I should learn to leave work aside to truly enjoy the break.

CONCLUSION
---------------

I liked my first solo trip. I understood a bit more about me. I prefer Madrid to Barcelona. I loved the Begur Area and the  Garrotxa park. 

I liked it so much that I did it again this year, in Northern Italy. You can probably find my report from mid-september under ""7 days in northern Italy"" somewhere in the posts below. 

Enjoy the reading, and if you have questions, feel free to ask. 

Cheers!

I have never traveled solo before! I am planning my first solo road trip. How is my plan so far?,"what’s up everybody! 

i’m 23 years old, and i haven’t been out of town in over a year and i have been saving all my 1’s and coins for a year now and i have a pretty good amount of cash saved up. i want to take a lone road trip next month, and i have never went on a long trip alone before. i live in central illinois, and i want to go to yosemite! i also want to stop by pikes peak on the way. 
i’m starting all this planning by creating my route and breaking it up into 8-10 hour stretches of driving. from where i live, my maps app tells me it will take 27 hours to drive to yosemite. i will only be able to have 8 days to make this trip happen. 
i have sundays and monday’s off from work, and i’m going to take 1 week off for this trip. i’m planning on leaving work on a saturday to shower and put my things in my car and leave around 1am just to get a start, and i will probably find a rest stop 2-3 hours out to get a nap in my car since i will be pretty tired after working 13 hours that day. that way i can just get the first few hours out of the way and get a head start.

day 1:
my first stop would be in denver, which is about 14 hours from where i live. i’m thinking i’m going to get a hotel there to rest up and i’m going to leave in the morning to pikes peak. 

day2:
it will be around 2 hours to get to the summit of pikes peak from denver, in which i’ll spend maybe 2-3 hours at. then i plan on making my way towards fresno from pikes peak.
i’m not sure which places to stop at to get sleep on the way to fresno, but i’m guessing i could make it about 11 hours and get a hotel room in saint george, utah. 

day 3:
wake up in saint george, and head towards fresno. this stretch would be about 7.5-8 hours. i will be going through las vegas on the way. i don’t have time to visit there, but i do want to get a picture at the famous welcome sign. 
when i get to fresno, i’m going to find a hotel and settle in. i’ll have a few hours to kill so i might just find a cool spot to eat, or grab a drink somewhere.

day 4:
this is the day i get to see what i ventured for! i’m going up to yosemite to spend the day. after this i am unsure if i should stay in fresno one more night to spend more time at yosemite, or start making my way back home afterwards. 

who has been to yosemite before? should i spend two days there?

a) i leave yosemite towards salt lake city, and stay somewhere in nevada over night on the way there. perhaps hawthorne, nevada which is 6.5-7 hours from yosemite. 
b) i drive back to fresno to stay another night.

day 5a:
i leave hawthorne, nevada in the morning to drive about 7.5-8 hours to salt lake city. coming from this way, i’ll get to drive through the salt flats. i’ve always wanted to see the salt flats in person. i’ll hang out in salt lake city for the night and rest there. 
day5b:
go to yosemite again the second day in a row, spend some hours there again, and then leave towards hawthorne, nevada to rest for the night.

day6a: 
check out salt lake city for the morning, find a nice spot to get some lunch, and then get on the road and drive 9.5 hours to north platte, nebraska to rest. 
day6b: 
drive to salt lake city to hang for the night.

day7a:
get on the road again to drive the last 9 or so hours home in illinois. i’ll get to look through all my pictures and unpack and get some rest before going back to work the next day. although, i only work 4 hours the first work day after this trip. 
day7b: head from salt lake to north platte, nebraska.

day 8b:
head from nebraska to home in illinois to get to bed and wrap up my vacation. 


how does this plan sound? does anyone know of any better ways to split up each stretch of driving? does anyone have any tips for someone traveling solo for on a long road trip like this for the first time? is there anything i should know about pikes peak or yosemite or salt lake city prior to visiting? 

thanks guys!!!

edit:
thanks for the input guys! creating a plan for this trip is so much fun, and i am really looking forward to this trip. 

i have decided that i am going post pone my trip until february/march. this will give me more time to plan and prepare. also, november might not be the best time to try and go up pikes peak, or drive through the high sierras lol. 

i am moving to chicago in march with two close friends, so i am going to plan to make this trip then. when i leave my current job, i am going to take two weeks to go on this trip before i start my new job in chicago. this way, i won’t have to feel any guilt from my current employers for taking two weeks off for myself. i know that i can get a week off, but i think asking for two would be pushing it. if i start a new job, i don’t think it would be right to take two weeks off for a long time, so i think it’s best to take this trip in between jobs. 
until then, i think i am going to just ask for two days off next month to make a 4 day weekend, and take a little solo trip up to the upper peninsula in northern wisconsin. my dad told me that it’s about a 6-7 hour drive, it’s touristy and scenic, and there was a lot of people my age around when he was there. at first that idea didn’t sound anywhere near as exciting as going to yosemite, because i’ve lived in illinois most my life and i was never too thrilled when i have visited wisconsin before. but i’ve never really been to the parks up there, so after thinking about it i think that does sound like a good idea. 

i think it will give me a taste of the solo travel and might prepare me more for my longer road trip i’m planning in the spring. it also won’t be expensive either. i want to check out the scenic spots at devils lake, and i want to hike around the apostle islands. 
not only that, but i’ll be able to get a case of that famous new glarus spotted cow to bring home! i don’t get to drink a spotted cow very often, but it can only be bought in wisconsin. where i live, everybody loves that stuff because it’s a treat you can’t have very often. whenever friends go up to wisconsin to visit, they always take orders for their friends and family and bring back spotted cows for everyone back home. if you’re unfamiliar, spotted cow is just a farmhouse style ale. we love it here in central illinois.
again, thanks for the replies! i’m very excited to plan this mini wisconsin trip and take my first official solo trip. 

have any of you traveled wisconsin? have any of you been to devils lake or the apostle islands? if so, how was it? are there any other places worth seeing in wisconsin?",solotravel,HoldenDarko

Montana - Middle of October,"Hi All, 

In the middle of October i'll be traveling to the great falls area for work. I'll have the weekend to myself and I do have some vacation days I am entertaining the idea of using after the weekend.   


My idea was to fly into Great Falls then fly out of Bozeman, MT. Is this a good idea? or are there NEED to see places, like Yellowstone? 

Whats the Covid situation like? 

Im in my early 30's and I enjoy new beers/bars, hikes, meeting new people, coffee, fishing could be cool or a hunting situation.

Met a suitable one while traveling,"During September 2019, I decided to bagpack across Europe as a graduation treat. It was a 2 month trip with no prior planning. While my time in Germany, someone in my hostel suggested me to try out paragliding in interlaken. I googled it and found it quite amusing. So while I was traveling from Frankfurt to Bern, I saw a girl in my train. I started a small talk with her and soon we both found each other truly interesting and started having longer conversations about ourselves. When we reached Bern, I told her that didn't make any hostel bookings and would be leaving for Interlaken 2 days after. She asked me if I wanna make a booking in the hostel she was staying in to which I agreed. We connected to greater extent through the conversations we were having. While traveling the old city, the only thing in my mind was to make a move and kiss her. I think she was thinking the same. We spent the whole night across a lonely sight across the Aare river. We talked about life and had some deep talks. I made a move and we had sex in the open. 

After 2 days, she agreed to travel with me to interlaken. After spending a fun day in interlaken, we came back to bern, from where she had to leave for france. We were extremely sad to leave each other that day and had a perfect make out at the train station. We exchanged our snapchats and said goodbyes 👋. 

Since then we have been connected through social media and have came even closer to each other. No I think she's is the one I always have been looking for. I'm thinking to propose her soon.",solotravel,[deleted]
"(Oregon, U.S.) Looking to do some solo traveling around Oregon. I have about a week to explore and would love to soak in the fall colors and crisp air while I can.

I’ve camped in Tillamook, cape disappointment, and Detroit lake and those were amazing as well. 

I’m thinking of checking out national parks if I can such as Crater lake, Olympic (in Washington) and maybe mt Rainier. 

I was going to hike the timberline trail with some friends but with the fires and wind as of now there’s a section that’s partially damaged and pretty difficult. My friends don’t want to do it so we’re camping elsewhere in the meantime, but I’d love to get some good hikes in soon while I can. 

Whether it’s camping or hiking or just exploring a secret gem of a state park, (or even something else entirely!) I just want to explore this beautiful state while I’m here during the prime fall time. 
Any recommendations are highly appreciated. Thanks to anyone who has some suggestions! 
Much love and your state is beautiful. But you PNW folk already know that.

EDIT: Thanks for all these amazing suggestions! So pumped to look all these places up. Was going to go to Smith Rock this wknd but it’s closed to camping right now :/ (Also air quality isn’t so good at the moment around Bend)

Colorado,"Is Colorado female solo travel friendly? 

I’m looking at going out in November for a weekish, nothing crazy, but I’m honestly hung up on on USA solo travel. 

I know they do have hostels in Colorado but I’ve only had less than stellar experiences with USA Hostels, I’m also not totally opposed to just doing cabins or Airbnb. 

It’s easy for me to travel in Asian and European countries solo but for some reason when it comes to my home country I get sketched out. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated!",solotravel,abandoned_angel
"People who have been burned out by work and took a month long or so vacation to recharge, where did you go and why?","Lots of people suffer from burnout, and I wouldn't be surprised if it has only gotten worse during the pandemic. I'm sure some of you have and took a long solo trip someplace to recharge the batteries, whether you go back to your old job or a brand new one when you come back home. Curious to hear where you have gone and why you chose that place or those places. Did you stay in one place the whole time? Two or three over the course of a month? Maybe you spent no more than a few days in one place?

isla holbox one of the last,"I had been eyeing Isla Holbox ever sense I did a roadtrip in the area, and it was exactly what I hoped for. A gritty but refined get lost kind  of an escape option in Covid times. And not for everyone which is what keeps it what it is. I  had thoughts of ""The Mosquito Coast"", an old Harrison Ford film on this  trip. As with any place you can find like this, it wont be long before  it changes. As for now, humbly enjoy an unforgettable experience.

First  things first: travel light, grab bug spray and exchange for some pesos.  Then wrap your head around getting to the island from the airport. You  could hire a quick prop plane ride, drive or shuttle. For most, a  shuttle does the trick and provides you with a perspective of the  undeveloped area outside of Cancun. A scheduled time shuttle is a very  reasonable price or you can pay double for a private ride. My suggestion  is to use the private ride to get there because the fair includes  shuttle, boat ride and cart taxi to your hotel. Now that you've had the  guided walk through you'll see how simple it is to return on your own  with a scheduled shuttle. This is a 2hr drive so if arriving into Cancun  later just stay at one of the close hotel options. Next morning you can  have your private ride arranged from the hotel or shuttle back to the  airport for a scheduled shuttle time.

[isla holbox](https://preview.redd.it/fknbr5ba3pr51.jpg?width=2048&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dc3529ca08d119836d3ab49df51a0da59a9635f8)

If driving through  undeveloped countryside, then taking a boat ride to arrive on a  primitively refined island sounds like your taste, you've just nailed  it. So now where to stay. After back-and-forth debating I decided on  Tierra del Mar. Bingo. What you have here is the perfect scenario for a  visit to the island: value, location and a peaceful size. Its a highly  maintained minimalist hotel (more of a bnb) with only 6 rooms with  patios, a small zen courtyard, pool and breakfast area. And just outside  the courtyard doors you have immediate access to the vibrant pleasure  of the primitive town and all its character. Not to mention the beach of  course is just an ally away. This as opposed to an upscale stay on the  beach made more sense to fully absorb the personality of the island. And  that's really how it felt.

Regardless of what you decide  everything is walking distance or a quick cart taxi away. After the trek  to get here, then quickly checking in and dropping your bags, all you  want to do is walk along the amazing waterfront. White sand, pond-calm  mint green water and knee deep for a couple hundred feet. Its so eye  catching that cloudy days are even more beautiful then blue sky because  the grays, blue and mint green is another worldly sight. Sooner or later  you'll decide to sit down with your feet up and grab some seafood for  lunch at Raices. I had the best sweet-spicy octopus ceviche salad  concoction I've ever eaten. And washed it down with a marg on the rocks.  Then carried on north to the end to get my bearings for several spots  for diner and drinks later on in the trip.

After that I was ready  to return to the quiet sanctuary of the hotel. Pool time with a  refreshment until dinner. There's a market just steps away for the  essentials. That evening I began with my first dinner at Zapata. A hand  crafted cave just right off the street with no flooring. The perfect  ambiance and grilled fish dinner to start and end the first day. Night  cap back at the pool and called it a day. The next morning I awoke to  the quiet and newly manicured zen of the small courtyard from my patio.  An assortment of breakfast options, and most importantly coffee, is  awaiting every morning at 8am. Perfecto. I took my time that morning  before heading, now south, along the coastline to the end. Honestly one  of the most unforgettable beach walks you'll ever have. The perfect  blend of natural beach beauty combined with sections of dilapidated  colorful structures. And again best seen cloudy for contrast.

Its  about 2-3hrs of walking once you get back to the hotel so pool time  once again before dinner. Refreshment in hand again--of course. After a  great couple hours relaxing at the pool it was time to get ready for  din. A much anticipated steak night at the rooftop of Parrilla de Juan. A  nice little walk through the town square to a colorfully tiled  staircase leading above to steak heaven. One of the best flavor of meat,  no sauce, I've had. And perfectly paired to savor with an Old Fashion  to wash down. Take your time here. Enjoy every bite and the open rooftop  evening. And with that back to a night cap at the pool and called it a  night. Boat day in the morning.

Another perfectly manicured  courtyard step over to breakfast and coffee. The quiet minimalist  mornings here are calming and very enjoyed. Especially being the last  morning to enjoy. The cart taxi would be arriving soon for my boat  excursion for the day. I could have simply walked to the beachfront and  hired the excursion myself but the prices are so reasonable even booking  through the hotel is shocking. (Speaking of price, it really should be  noted how great of a value this island visit it. It's very very  reasonable. To get the best pricing for smaller business make sure to  have pesos. For the fancier drinks and dinner spots at hotels a CC is  fine.) For the excursion I went with the multi island tour. Nothing  really note worthy except the sandbar stop, which is worth it alone.  Other than that its just a great day out on the mint green waters.

Before  relaxing back at the pool for my last day I wanted to grab some tacos  street side. So I popped over to Barba Negra for an assortment of taco  offers. Its everything you'd be looking for: good vibes, great drinks  and mouthwatering tacos. From there I was set for my last time by the  pool and the big decision. The last night dinner choice along with a  comfortable shirt and my slip ons.  There's a couple choices best for this that end on a fancier note. And  to be upfront, honest and fair I didn't make the right choice. I wanted  to end with sushi to enjoy the fresh option that seems no-brainer. I  went with, what was highly recommended, Tamashi Sky Bar. Unfortunately,  being the Covid situation the dinner area was really just a pool area,  its back off the beach and the sushi was just ok. My suggestion is to  end with dinner on the water at Casa Las Tortugas or Las Nubes. Both are  the finer hotel options on the island and offer a very scenic dinner  experience on the water.

But hey, no complaints the evening was  still very enjoyed and ended with a last night cap back at the pool. The  next morning I awoke early and enjoyed the short walk back to the ferry  terminal. A last gritty and quiet pleasure that will be remembered  forever. The few early streetside vendors preparing coffee and juices  and tortilla shops long at work already. Then on to your last ferry  ride, on the top open deck, to ponder what you've just experienced. The  perfect blend of primitive and refined option with the energy of one of  your favorite tropical adventure films. The 7:15am shuttle will be  awaiting for your ride back to the airport. Enjoy.

Pro Tip: Have  pesos on you for your beach walks, there's several stops to grab a  refreshment. Hagel at the beach with the vendors for your boat day,  especially with a group. Do grab a dinner night at Luuma. And consider  trying different hotels, especially for the last evening along with  dinner.",solotravel,_buoyed_

I am looking to take 6 months off work to travel as soon as covid is over, i have worked without a break of more than 2 weeks since age 14 !( (just turned 31) so I am super itching to do this (was planned for this year but yeah)

I have a fairly good idea of what the cost of doing this is, but would like other peoples opinions and experiences so i can budget better. I am planning on going to Russia, Isreal, China/Korea and also Southern USA and possibly back to Europe. (I live in UK).

So what do you guys think ? I suspect I am looking at around 10k.

My solo trip to Berlin during a pandemic,"I just got back from a weekend trip to Berlin from Venice. I'm a 23 years old girl.

While the airport was almost empty and i encountered no queues, my ryanair flight was packed, but everyone was wearing masks and using hand sanitizers. 

I arrived to Shonefeld on friday and took the covid test immediatly. It wasn't mandatory but i took it anyway. I'd rather be safe than sorry. There was only a five minute queue to get it. I got my results through the app, the same evening.

Got to my hotel by using the S-bahn which was almost empty.

I than took a walk around the city. By german law you are not required to keep your masks outside, but i wore mine all the time, even when i was alone. I noticed that germans do not like to wear masks, wheather it was outside, and someone even didn't wore it inside places.

The only ones who where wearing masks where tourists from other countries.

The next day i took a free walking tour. We wore masks and keep 1.5 meters apart between each other, and we were a small group anyway. All the attractions visited were outside.

On sunday i took a tour to Sachsenhausen, a concentration camp. This one was really sad but really interesting. All partecipants respected the social distancing rules.

I didn't eat at restaurants, i only eat take away in my room to be safe and wore gloves when taking my food. 

Before leaving monday i took another covid test at the airport.

&amp;#x200B;

I think we should travel, to an extent. the guides i spoke to where almost moved to tears that somebody showed up for the tour, because us travelling is the only reason they have a job and can provide food for their families. 

If you travel, be careful, wear a mask, take covid tests if you can. And of course check the rules of your country and the country you want to travel to. Safety is always the priority.

I am mixed Caribbean/Welsh, with facial piercings and pec-length dreadlocks, in case that makes any difference.

I'm also a short guy, at 5'6"", in case that also makes any difference (in terms of maybe being more or less imposing to the general public and police officers)

Edit: For context, I come from Cardiff, which, as a former Port City, is one of the most diverse cities in the UK.  The city can, however, be dangerous, and knowing what's what and who's who goes a long way over here.  Racism, however, isn’t that big of a deal here, at least in my experience, and what racist experiences I have had here are mostly just kids being retarded, or people with genuinely decent intentions coming out with kinda dodgy questions/statements.

Edit 2: For the most part, I'm not really worried about racism among the public, and am more worried about areas in which being black could get me shot, for example (going off of what I've heard/read of course) That's not to say that i want to visit a fully bigoted, Southern stereotype kind of area, but as a person, as long as it's only an annoyance and not a danger, racism doesn't really bother me all that much, provided I am safe.",solotravel,chickentoast26

"Covid cancelled my trip, looking for advice and recommendations","So I planned my very first international trip for November 3-25, and it happened to be to a bunch of countries I can no longer get into. I have this time off from work and I don't really want to waste it so I'm looking for advice for last minute travel to somewhere letting Americans in. IDK if I should look for some kind of guided trips, like from Intrepid travel, or just make something up on my own at this point. Also Intrepid and Quark are the only companies I know about, can anyone recommend others to look at? What places should I look into going? 

I don't want to have to quarantine after arrival because that would waste most of my trip. I already got Covid in April so I'm not worried about getting it myself, but I also don't know if activities will be shut down or not. I'm out of shape and not looking to do any kind of intense physically active travelling, something more like a casual city I can explore at my own pace. Thanks for any advice.

Edit: Thanks everyone for your advice. I'd also like to say I got covid from working as a nurse in a covid unit, so I am well versed in the subject.

"Trip to Munich, Berlin, Prague, and Krakow - Advice needed","Hi, in mid-late October I'm thinking of doing a 14 day trip to Munich, Berlin, Prague, and maybe Krakow if I can squeeze it in. I'm currently from Canada which, for now, is allowed unrestricted entry into these countries. This is my first trip to Europe so I might have to move slower due to my inexperience.

I know a more common first Central/Eastern Europe trip is Prague, Budapest, Vienna, but both Vienna and Budapest aren't allowing visitors from Canada

Going into Prague first would mean I can't go into Germany due to Covid restrictions, so I think I'll have to start with Germany.

I'd appreciate some advice on whether this rough schedule would work given my interests.

**Interests**:

\- Beautiful sights like Neuschwanstein Castle, the Alps, Prague Castle, Salt Mines- Museums- History- Trying new food

I've roughly allocated 3 days to each place since the 10h flight from Canada to Berlin will happen on Day 1 and the return flight from Krakow to Canada.

**Day 1-4: Berlin**

\- 10h flight to Berlin

\- Take the Deutsche Bahn to Munich on last day (\~5 hours)

**Day 5-8 Munich**

\- Day trip to the Bavarian Alps

\- \~5 hour train ride to Prague

**Day 8-11 Prague**

\- Either 9 hour train ride or 1 hour flight to Krakow

**Day 11-14 Krakow**

\- If time permits, would like to check out the Aushwitz Memorial

\- Fly back to Canada on last day (10h+ flight)

My best friend tainted the last European trip we took. Would I be wrong to tell her I want to travel alone from now on?,"About two years ago I traveled to Europe for a week with my best friend and could not believe how horrible she acted. We stopped at a fast food restaurant on the way to the airport and she made a comment about how the worker should be in college and not working there. At the airport, we ran into someone we went to high school with and she laughed at him for working there and having to watch us take a trip to Spain. When we got there, she was extremely controlling, talked down to me and others regularly, barely wanted to go anywhere or do anything while on the trip, and had a micromanaging attitude 80% of the time. While I still managed to have a great trip and found a new obsession with traveling, I didn’t have fun with her. I had fun in spite of her. 

When we got back home we didn’t speak for months. She later apologized to me and said that she realized whenever she feels insecure or bad about herself she treats others badly to feel better about herself. I’ve forgiven her and I still consider her my best friend, but I later found out she told the rest of our friend group that while she can be very “motherly”, I was the one who was “stubborn” and didn’t want to do or try anything new. THIS coming from someone who didn’t want to go to any main attractions, sites or events and wanted to go to the same cafe every day. To me, that was her way of not taking full responsibility for her actions. I decided after that I will never travel with her again and travel solo going forward. Recently, our friends group started planning a trip for when covid dies down. I’ve made it clear that I won’t be going and while I haven’t said it outright, they all know it’s because she’s going too. They said I should move past it and give her a second chance but I refuse because I know how bad she acted. I truly love her and we are still best friends, but I’ve decided not to let her taint another trip for me. Am I wrong for that?",solotravel,YoYoheel73
